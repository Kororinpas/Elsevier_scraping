Our findings suggest that this gap cannot be explained by institutional obstacles to entering a major. Instead, the primary mechanisms behind this phenomenon are indecisiveness and preference changes.","Policy-makers have widely recognized the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of higher education using metrics such as costs per student and graduation rates. However, despite an average spending of $10,351 per full-time student in 2017 by OECD countries (OECD, 2020, pp. 208 and 275), only two out of three students graduate within three years of their expected graduation date. The direct costs of dropping out, both to individuals and society, are substantial, compounded by indirect costs such as lost tax revenues for the state and delayed entry into the labor market for students. For example, in the Netherlands, the annual total cost of dropping out and study switching has been estimated to be 5.7 billion euros (Borghans and Golsteyn, 2006).====Given these significant costs, there is a pressing need to identify and address the factors that contribute to low graduation rates. While extensive research has been conducted on the drivers of university dropout rates, including uncertainty in educational decision-making (e.g., Manski, 1989), personal characteristics (e.g., Almås et al., 2016), socio-economic background (e.g., Aina, 2013), financial pressure (e.g., Castex, 2017), peer effects (e.g., Arulampalam et al., 2005), cognitive and non-cognitive skills (e.g., Hanushek, Woessmann, 2008, Heckman, Rubinstein, 2001), learning about one’s own abilities (e.g., Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2013), and a lack of information (Conlon, 2021, Wiswall, Zafar, 2015), our understanding of the specific preferences that drive voluntary dropout decisions remains limited.====Recent work by Conlon and Patel (2022) suggests that occupational preferences for the typical career associated with the major is often the driver of major choice. Additionally, students may overestimate the likelihood of achieving these careers after degree completion or misperceive the careers that a major can lead to, resulting in costly adjustments in human capital investments. However, empirical evidence on whether students revise their human capital investments when their chosen major is unlikely to lead to their aspired career is still lacking in the literature.====In this study, we utilize unique longitudinal data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) in Germany to examine the impact of occupational preference-major mismatches on university dropout rates. By following upper secondary school students beyond their tertiary education choices, we can observe occupational preferences prior to university enrollment and the majors chosen upon enrollment, minimizing the risk of ex-post rationalization of occupational preferences. We develop a measure of mismatch by creating a crosswalk of majors to occupations using data from the German Graduate Panel (DZHW) and cohorts of graduates from 2009 and 2013. This measure allows us to determine the extent of the mismatch between occupational aspirations and chosen university majors.====Consistent with prior research (e.g., Dasgupta, Sharma, 2022, Wiswall, Zafar, 2015), we find that male and female students tend to sort into different majors, with the dropout rate varying by gender-major combination (averaging 29%). We demonstrate that our measure of mismatch is highly predictive of dropout rates, with a 9-percentage-point increase in dropout likelihood for students with a mismatch, even after controlling for a student studying the preferred major and a range of personal characteristics and cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Notably, we observe a larger coefficients for female students, who are 13 percentage points more likely to drop out if they experience a mismatch, while no such relation is evident for male students.====We find that our results are highly robust across various specifications. First, we test the robustness of our findings by including older cohorts of graduates in the analysis. We use data from the DZHW for the cohorts of 2001 and 2005 and find that the results are quantitatively similar to those from the 2009 and 2013 cohorts. Additionally, we find similar results when we use older cohorts from the NEPS to generate major-occupation crosswalks instead of the DZHW data. Furthermore, we test the sensitivity of our measure of occupational mismatch by using an index of occupational similarity rather than a simple binary indicator of mismatch. We find that a one-point increase in the index of occupational similarity decreases the dropout rate by approximately 5 percentage points. Finally, we make a distinction between study switch and definitive drop out from university and show our findings really are driven by the relation between a major occupation mismatch and drop out.====In addition to examining the simple dropout decision, we also analyze the timing of dropout of students and find a gender difference in the timing of university dropout in relation to the mismatch between majors and occupational preferences. Specifically, we find that males with a mismatch tend to drop out in their first year than those without a mismatch, while no such pattern is observed for female dropouts. This suggests that female dropouts are more likely to make an early adjustment to their university program regardless of the mismatch, whereas males tend to drop out later in their study program but are more likely to make an early adjustment when they have a mismatch between their major and occupational preferences.====The observed pattern of findings can be attributed to three potential explanations, which we examine in our paper. First, we investigate the possibility of informational misperception, which refers to the lack of knowledge about which majors lead to which occupations. To test this, we use occupational preference-major preference match as a proxy for informational accuracy prior to university enrollment and only include students with a match in our analysis. We find that the estimates remain consistent with our main results. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that students who drop out and have a mismatch are less likely to switch to a major that aligns with their pre-university occupational preferences than students who drop out and have a match. These findings speak against informational misperceptions as a potential explanation as has been suggested in other related studies (e.g., Wiswall and Zafar, 2015b).====Second, it is possible that students enroll in university without a clear idea of their career preferences, hoping to use their time there to explore their options and eventually settle on a suitable major. Our analysis suggests that this indecisiveness is a common experience among students, as evidenced by our data. Interestingly, we find that the difference in dropout rates is not significant within gender-mismatch groups but rather between them. Moreover, the difference in dropout rates is particularly pronounced for females with and without a mismatch. To investigate possible coping strategies, we analyze whether selecting occupationally broad majors could reduce dropout incidence. We find that males benefit from choosing broad majors when they have a mismatch or no clear preferences, while females only seem to benefit from broad majors when they have not reported clear preferences. For both males and females, we find that dropping out is unrelated to the breadth of majors when their occupational preference matches their chosen major.====Third, it is possible that students modify their occupational preferences after enrolling in university, as their new environment and peers shape and influence their aspirations (e.g., Chevalier et al., 2020). Our analysis suggests that changes in occupational preferences can increase dropout rates if they result in a mismatch between the student’s occupational preference and university major. Interestingly, we find significant gender differences in the impact of these changes. Females exhibit lower dropout rates when their occupational preference and major match both before and after enrolling in university. In contrast, males exhibit a lower dropout rate when their occupational preference and major match after enrolling in university, regardless of their prior mismatch status.====We make two contributions to the literature. First, our study contributes to the literature on university dropout decisions by exploring the connection between labor market preferences and educational choices. We take a novel approach by investigating the mismatch between occupational preferences and majors and how it relates to the decision to drop out, an aspect that has been overlooked in previous studies (see, e.g., Aina, Baici, Casalone, Pastore, 2018, Aina, Baici, Casalone, Pastore, 2021, for extensive summaries of the dropout literature). In particular, our study builds on recent research by Blom et al. (2021) and Acton (2021) which suggests that prospective students consider the current labour market situation when choosing their major, and argues that occupational preferences play a crucial role in shaping major choices (Conlon and Patel, 2022). Importantly, unlike previous studies that only surveyed students at the time of their enrollment (e.g., Conlon, Patel, Zafar, 2013), we capitalize on the longitudinal nature of our data to measure preferences before university enrollment, hereby eliminating any ex-post rationalization in preferences. By doing so, our study provides essential insights into the factors that influence the decision to drop out of university, filling a critical gap in the literature.====Second, our study contributes to the literature on gender differences in educational preferences and enrollment decisions (e.g., Wiswall, Zafar, 2018, Zafar, 2013). As shown by Croson and Gneezy (2009), significant differences exist between genders in risk preferences and competition behavior, which also influence gender differences in the choice of majors (Reuben et al., 2017). While we utilize a more generalized measure of preferences through stated occupational preferences, our study provides gender-specific evidence on the dropout behavior of students who experience a mismatch between their occupational preference and major choice. By focusing on this specific aspect, our study adds valuable insights to the literature and highlights the importance of considering gender differences in educational decision-making.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Investment projects were ranked by numerical scores of project quality and funded until exhaustion of funds. Exploiting this allocation mechanism as an ideal regression discontinuity design, we estimate that subsidies increased investment of marginal firms near the cutoff by 39 percent, and employment by 17 percent over a 6-year period. Building on recent advancements in the econometrics of regression discontinuity designs, we characterize treatment effect heterogeneity and cost-effectiveness of subsidies across inframarginal firms. Smaller firms exhibit higher employment growth upon receiving the subsidy, but larger firms generate more jobs at a lower cost, and younger firms do better than older firms.","Public subsidies to private business are an important instrument through which governments sustain employment levels and economic development. While they are on top of the political agenda in many countries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis, there is great uncertainty regarding their effectiveness. One relevant concern is that public subsidies might end up financing projects that would have been undertaken anyway (i.e., they have no “additional” effect). This would be the case of programs that do not effectively target firms constrained by frictions or market imperfections, a typical example in this respect being small businesses.====Small firms make a significant contribution to economic activity and employment opportunities, generating disproportionately more new jobs relative to their employment share.==== At the same time, small firms are more likely to miss available growth opportunities, as they depend more on external finance (due to limited internal resources and higher volatility of earnings) while having at the same time less access to that (due to greater information and transaction costs, low availability of collateral etc.).==== Against this background, however, it is unclear whether public interventions targeting small firms may address these constraints,==== and, importantly, whether it is more cost-effective than targeting other firms.====In this paper, we quantify the effects and the cost-effectiveness of subsidies targeting firms of different size and age within a large program of public support to private business implemented in Italy for more than 10 years. The analysis leverages an ideal regression discontinuity design (RDD), as firms’ applications for subsidies were ranked on quantitative indicators of project quality and funded until the exhaustion of available funds. Comparing applicants ranked just above and just below the cutoff for being funded, we estimate that obtaining the subsidy increases firm employment by 17 percent over a period of six years. When we distinguish applicants by size, smaller firms generate larger percent increases in employment than large firms - respectively, +22 and +8 percent. However, given the difference in the initial size, these percent increases translate into a greater increase in the number of new jobs for large firms than for small firms - respectively, +5 and +0.7 jobs per subsidized applicant. Therefore, the cost effectiveness of the subsidy - in terms of euros transferred to the firm per each newly-created job - is higher for large firms than for small firms close to the cutoff. Specifically, the cost of a new job surviving six years into the program is 866 thousand euros in the case of small firms, as opposed to 159 thousand euros in that of large firms. However, these estimates are only valid across firms close to the cutoff and, as such, they do not allow us to compute the overall cost-effectiveness of the policy.====We address this limitation following the approach of Angrist and Rokkanen (2015), who provide a method for extrapolating RDD estimates away from the cutoff. In a nutshell, their method leverages on the RDD to test (i) ignorability of treatment assignment and (ii) common support conditional on a vector of observable characteristics. The average cost of a new job estimated across all large and small (inframarginal) firms away from the cutoff (121 and 633 thousand euros, respectively) is lower than the cost estimated across marginal firms close to the cutoff. On the other hand, the average cost across all inframarginal firms is slightly higher than the cost estimated close to the cutoff due to a different composition by size. These results highlight the importance of estimating policy effects – whenever possible - over a larger population than only marginal units close to the cutoff. In any event, all estimates confirm that large firms are more cost-effective than small firms. Echoing the findings by Haltiwanger et al. (2013), we also document that, conditional on size, young firms generate larger percent increases in employment and are more cost-effective than old firms.====These findings stand in contrast with previous evidence on heterogeneity of subsidy effects by firm size. Criscuolo et al. (2019) document significant employment effect of investment subsidies in the UK and attribute them to the activity of small firms (i.e., up to 50 employees). Interestingly, such effect does not seem to be driven by (the removal of) financial constraints, as young firms also respond less to the policy. Bronzini and Iachini (2014) also find that R&D subsidies in one Italian region only induce an increase in investment by small firms, fully displacing private expenditure in the case of large firms. On a more general note, Denes et al. (2022) find that the crowding out of smallest firms (i.e., up to 20 employees) from a US subsidy program (the Small Business Act) led to lower employment growth, a higher probability of unemployment, and lower wages. Closer to our findings, several works find that the removal of preferential treatment for small firms in India led to increases in profits, employment, and output (Banerjee, Duflo, 2014, Martin, Nataraj, Harrison, et al., 2017, Rotemberg, 2019). We contribute to this literature by leveraging on an ideal research design to estimate the effect of an important subsidy program along the firm size distribution.====In the next section we describe the institutional context; Section 3 and 4 introduce the data and empirical strategy, respectively; Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 concludes.",Granting more bang for the buck: The heterogeneous effects of firm subsidies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000787,Available online 11 June 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

We distinguish between the absence of a substitute worker, who performs the same tasks as the focal workers, and the absence of a complementary co-workers, who performs complementary tasks to the focal workers. When either type of co-worker is absent, remaining workers produce less output per working time. In the case of a substitute absentee, they compensate for this by increasing their working time at the expense of the (less able) replacement worker. This renders the output loss per remaining substitute worker to be insignificant. For the absence of a complementary worker, the productivity loss leads to a loss of total output per worker, because remaining workers cannot take over the absent co-worker’s tasks.","Absenteeism may severely depress the output firms produce, particularly when production involves teamwork. Output loss due to absenteeism occurs through two channels, one direct and one indirect. First, the firm may be unable to hire or assign an equally productive worker to replace the absentee, resulting in a direct loss of production (Herrmann and Rockoff, 2012). Second, there is an indirect production loss if remaining co-workers of the absentee produce less because their productivity depends on their absent (and perhaps replaced) co-worker (Bartel et al., 2014). In this paper, we decompose the total effect of a worker’s absence into this direct and indirect component. We first focus on the indirect effect by analyzing the impact of a worker’s temporary absence and replacement on==== the output of the remaining co-workers in their production team. We then compare the production of the absentee with the production of their replacement worker and show how much these two effects contribute to the total output loss at team level.====In the economic literature on absenteeism, most studies focus on the causes of absenteeism (see e.g., De Paola et al. (2014); Godøy and Dale-Olsen (2018); Markussen et al. (2011)). By contrast, we focus on the consequences of absenteeism for production, which has attracted far less academic interest to date. Herrmann and Rockoff (2012) show that student grades obtained under the supervision of regular teachers are significantly higher than grades obtained under temporary replacements. As such, they document the direct production loss of replacing a regular worker by a temporary replacement. Bartel et al. (2014) evaluate the production effects of composition disruptions in nursing teams, finding negative effects from nurse departures or new hires on team production. We connect these two insights by disentangling the decrease in team production into the effect of productivity losses of the remaining co-workers (as in Bartel et al. (2014)) and the direct productivity loss from replacing absent workers by less able replacements (as in Herrmann and Rockoff (2012)).====Our analysis fits in the literature on co-worker effects of absenteeism and turnover. This literature has extensively documented several plausible mechanisms for the co-worker effects we identify: peer effects due to complementarities in the production function (Arcidiacono, Kinsler, Price, 2017, Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Wang, 2010, Gould, Winter, 2009), productivity gains from co-working experience between workers (Berman, Down, Hill, 2002, Shamsie, Mannor, 2013) and productivity losses associated with the onboarding costs of replacement employees (Kuhn and Yu, 2021).====Our empirical strategy addresses the issue of endogenous staffing changes by exploiting quasi-random co-worker injuries in sports teams as a source of temporary absences and replacements. To this end we use data from the National Hockey League. In this regard, our paper builds on previous work using injury data from professional athletes to examine health shocks in the labor market. For example, Carrieri et al. (2020) calculate the wage loss Italian football players incur when they suffer an injury, Stuart (2017) evaluates the team productivity effects of injuries for different types of injured players, Gregory-Smith (2021) uses injuries to examine whether National Football League players are paid according to their marginal revenue product and Fischer et al. (2022) investigate the productivity effects of COVID-19 on the performance of top league football players in Germany and Italy.====The contribution of our analysis is threefold. First, we estimate the effect of an absence on the productivity, working time and output produced by the remaining co-workers. Second, we distinguish between two types of absent worker, those who perform the same task as the remaining co-workers (substitute co-worker) and those with a complementary task in the production team (complementary co-worker). The absence of both types has a negative impact on the productivity of the remaining co-workers, as they produce less output per minute worked. In case a substitute worker is absent, the remaining co-workers compensate for this productivity loss by increasing their working time. The increase in working time counteracts the loss of worker productivity. An increase in working time does not occur when the absentee is a complementary co-worker. Therefore, the absence of a complementary co-worker has a more severe impact on the resulting output produced per remaining worker than the absence of a substitute co-worker. Third, we show how the indirect co-worker effects combined with the direct effect of the lower average ability of replacement workers impacts the total production of the team.====In Section 2 we discuss the institutional features of the National Hockey League and explain how we exploit these to identify the impact of absences. We then discuss the construction of our data set in Section 3 and empirical strategy in Section 4. Section 5 presents the main results of our analyses, followed by a set of robustness checks in Section 6.

To understand the heterogeneous impact of the crisis on the workforce, we split the sample based on workers’ labour market status in the first four months of 2020: (i) those continuously employed, (ii) those who lost their job, and (iii) those not employed (either new entrants or with previous work experience). While workers in the first group were more likely to keep their job during the pandemic than in the past, the others faced scarce employment prospects for a prolonged period. The probability to find a job decreased sharply for labour market entrants, amplifying pre-existing differences. Finally, we do not find evidence of significant cross-firm or cross-sectoral reallocation.","The Covid-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented labour market shock whose consequences on the labour force are not yet fully understood. While labour demand suddenly froze as the pandemic hit, the massive use of job retention schemes (OECD, 2021) significantly contained the potential wave of job destruction, but benefitted more employees on permanent contracts. The pandemic shock had therefore highly heterogeneous consequences, hitting employed and job seekers with different intensities, and potentially inducing a significant process of labour reallocation.====The main contribution of this paper is to investigate several dimensions of such heterogeneity. In particular, we investigate who were the most affected workers in the early stages of the pandemic, whether the subsequent recovery favoured their reallocation, and, if so, towards which sectors or employment contracts.====To address these questions, we exploit very rich Italian administrative data on a large random sample of work relationships that have undergone a labour contract event, namely activation and termination. We then construct a panel of workers – about 13 per cent of the Italian workforce – for whom we observe each job and its main features (length, detailed sector and occupation) from January 2018 until December 2021. We analyse three groups of workers defined as those that between January and April 2020 (i) were continuously employed, which we define as the workers with most stable employment; (ii) those who lost their job; and (iii) those who were not employed (either new entrants or with previous work experiences). Comparing them with similar groups of workers in previous years, we uncover several important facts. In the months following the pandemic onset, workers with stable jobs fared better than those who lost or did not have a job in the first four months of 2020, thanks also to the unprecedented use of employment protection schemes and a partial layoff ban on permanent contracts, in place in Italy for most of 2020 and 2021 (Bank of Italy, 2021). The health emergency amplified existing differences in the duration of employment by affecting two margins: the job survival probability for those already employed (which increased relatively to the past) and the probability to find a job for non-employed workers (which decreased). Migrants, young and low-educated workers suffered most from such an increase in the between-group differences in employment status. In addition, we do not find evidence of significant cross-firm and cross-sectoral reallocation for any of the groups we analyse.====Last, we provide suggestive evidence that our results depend relatively more on the demand rather than on the supply side of the labour market. To this end, we use the pre-pandemic period separations (namely, endings of fixed-term contracts and layoffs – related to the demand side –, and voluntary quits – related to the supply side) to show that the reduced firms’ turnover seems to explain most of the reduction in worker flows.====Our focus is on Italy, which represents an ideal case to study how the pandemic affected labour market dynamics. First, Italy was the first Western country where Covid-19 was, unexpectedly, discovered at the end of February 2020: this allows us to focus on the consequences of the pandemic, ruling out anticipation effects and cross-country economic spillovers. Second, the Italian labour market resembles in most ways that of all other major European countries with its extensive use of job retention schemes and a dual structure of permanent and temporary jobs (Garibaldi and Tealdi, 2013).==== Third, the timely and rich administrative data available in Italy represent an advancement in the measurement of job transitions with respect to those traditionally used in the literature (Fujita et al., 2020) as they record all jobs and their detailed characteristics for a large random sample of workers.====This paper contributes to the recent literature that analyses labour market flows to understand adjustments following the Covid-19 pandemic (Aaronson et al., 2021; Cortes and Forsythe, 2022; Lafuente and Ruland, 2022) and to the literature on the occupational mobility across the business cycle. With respect to the former contribution, of particular interest for us is the work by Casarico and Lattanzio (2022) that uses the same data sources and shows that, at the very initial stage of the pandemic, hires slowed down for all workers, but more so for women, young, low-educated workers, and those with fixed-term contracts. We innovate with respect to their paper by analysing the job flow dynamics over a longer horizon, informing on the labour market opportunities at the outbreak of the pandemic and throughout the following recovery. Differently from their approach, we compare labour market trajectories before and after the pandemic of workers with stable jobs and those who lost their job, analysing their reallocation probabilities towards other firms or sectors besides their employment status. The focus on reallocation is, in particular, an innovation with respect to Casarico and Lattanzio (2022); it also complements the analyses conducted on other countries, which show that, after an initial spike, reallocation and labour market mismatch have been quite limited (e.g., see Pizzinelli and Shibata (2023) for the US and the UK; Forsythe et al. (2022) for the US; Goméz and Lattanzio (2023) for Spain). Our analyses are consistent with those in Lafuente and Ruland (2022), who show a marked increase in employment-to-non-participation flows during the pandemic using labour force survey data for some European countries, including Italy. More specifically, they find that the hiring margin, and not separations, is the driving force behind Covid-related employment losses, possibly an effect of layoffs restriction policies. Similar to us, they also find lower conversion rates to open-ended contracts and more employment losses amongst temporary workers. With respect to their paper, we contribute by analysing a longer time period and by distinguishing separating workers from employed and non-employed individuals at the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, although their paper can distinguish non-employment from non-participation, the administrative data we use allow us (i) to monitor worker transitions across employers, as they report firm identifiers, and (ii) differentiate between quits, layoffs and fixed-term contract terminations.====As for the mobility across the business cycle, a large economic literature studies the role of job transitions as an indicator of the health status of the economy. Labour reallocation is generally associated with a rise in productivity and growth, both determining innovation advancements and driving the business cycle (Shimer, 2001; Davis and Haltiwanger, 2014; for a review, see Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2018). Studying job flows is thus informative of the status of the labour market recovery post-Covid-19 and of the extent of perspective labour reallocation, productivity and wage growth.==== While we do not observe earnings in our dataset, our analysis can still be informative to study unemployment (Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers, 2023) and the employment and vacancy dynamics during the recovery (Eeckhout and Lindenlaub, 2019).====Finally, several papers advanced the hypothesis that the pandemic could have triggered a permanent cross-sectoral reallocation process due to changes in consumers and workers’ preferences, and a swift increase in technology adoption – based on the observation that the duration of the pandemic was ex-ante uncertain. Barrero et al. (2020), Barrero et al. (2021) and Anayi et al. (2021) show that the degree of potential reallocation has been rising since the Covid-19 shock, especially in favour of industries with remote workable occupations. Such hypothesis, however, needs to be tested empirically: although cross-employers transitions are procyclical in the US and the UK (Moscarini and Thomsson, 2007; Carrillo-Tudela et al., 2016; IMF, 2021), the specificity of the pandemic and of the policies implemented during the first waves may have triggered different responses during the current recovery (with respect to other non-pandemic recoveries). Our analysis indicates that, over a time horizon of almost two years after the pandemic onset, job mobility across firms and sectors has been limited, confirming that such reallocation forces did not prevailed, at least in the short-term.

Many papers have documented that relatively younger students in a given cohort perform more poorly in academic tests (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006), playing sports (Helsen et al., 2005), and other school activities (Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2008). In addition, some studies have reported that month of birth affects long-term outcomes including university enrollment (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006), labor earnings (Kawaguchi, 2011), and top management (Du et al., 2012) and political positions (Muller and Page, 2016).====While the negative consequences of being among the youngest in class have been well documented, what remains less known is how children and their parents respond to disadvantages caused by being relatively young beyond delaying school enrollment (known as redshirting). Do parents of a younger student in a cohort make a compensatory investment to catch up with the child’s peers? Teachers and peer students can also influence the skill formation of younger students. Do teachers provide younger students with a support so that younger students perform at their best? Do school peers help younger students or bully them instead? These questions are important for understanding how skill formation through own investment and influences from others varies by birth month.====The objectives of this paper are to estimate the effects of month of birth on cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as high school quality, and to examine possible mechanisms for the finding that birth month is correlated with long-run outcomes. More specifically, we estimate the month-of-birth gaps in time use, prep school attendance, participation in sports, and the quality of relationships with teachers and peer students.====Our analysis is based on longitudinal data of all fourth to ninth graders in public schools in the province==== of Saitama, Japan in 2015–2018. The quality of our data is arguably superior to many data sources in the literature and hence strength of the paper. First, our data include noncognitive skill measures for more than one million student-year observations, which enables us to estimate parameters precisely enough to detect nuanced patterns. It is true that other administrative data sets are larger than ours, but they do not have noncognitive skill measures as far as we know. Second, because the data include all public school students, we have very little concerns about potential biases arising from attrition, which is often the case with panel data such as ECLS-K and NLSY.====The timing of school enrollment in Japan is strictly determined by birth date, which differs from many countries, such as the USA, but is similar to institutions in England, Norway, and Iceland. Because redshirting is virtually impossible in Japan, only the month of birth determines whether a student is one of the youngest in his/her grade cohort. We estimate the month-of-birth effects by assuming that the month of birth is exogenous. We validate this assumption by showing that family socioeconomic status (SES) and birth outcomes such as birth weight are largely uncorrelated with the month of birth.====Our estimation results indicate that the month of birth affects both cognitive and noncognitive skills. High school is not a part of compulsory education in Japan, and students must pass a competitive entrance exam to enter a high-quality high school. Consequently, there is also a significant gap in high school quality by birth month. The youngest students in grade four have test scores about 0.35 standard deviations lower than those of the oldest students; however, these gaps in test score decrease to 0.13-0.18 by grade nine. Findings for noncognitive skills such as conscientiousness are particularly interesting. Consistent with existing psychological studies on adolescence, noncognitive skills tend to decrease with grade in our data. However, the youngest students in a given grade have noncognitive skills about 0.1 standard deviations lower than the oldest students in the same grade. Because noncognitive skills do not improve with grade, the gap between the oldest and youngest students in the same grade suggests that the month of birth influences the formation of noncognitive skills. In addition, this month-of-birth gap in noncognitive skills remains nearly constant over time, which is in contrast with the dynamics of the cognitive skill gap.====We then examine how younger students and their parents respond to their disadvantages, and find that the youngest students in the ninth grade work 0.3 more hours per week outside of school than the oldest students. They also read for more hours and are more likely to attend a prep school. Overall, younger students and their parents make compensatory investment in cognitive skills; however, they spend 0.2 fewer hours per week on sports, arts, and music, which may lead to lower noncognitive skills, in light of the findings of psychological studies (Ishihara, Sugasawa, Matsuda, Mizuno, 2018, Moreno, Bialystok, Barac, Schellenberg, Cepeda, Chau, 2011). Another important factor that may influence children’s noncognitive skills is interpersonal relationships. Our estimates indicate that the youngest students suffer about 0.06 standard deviations poorer relationships with their teachers and 0.09-0.12 standard deviations poorer relationships with their school peers, which may lead to lower noncognitive skills for younger children (Leary, Baumeister, 2000, Reitz, Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf, 2016, Wu, Hu, Fan, Zhang, Zhang, 2018). Poor interpersonal relationships may lead to persistent month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills.====This paper contributes to the literature on month-of-birth effects in two ways. First, we show a set of evidence for compensatory investment by younger students in a grade cohort, which has implications for efficiency and equity. Younger children and their parents seem to decide on skill investment through comparisons with exactly the same grade cohort; however, they will be compared with individuals not only in the same but also in a different grade cohort once they enter the labor market. Compensatory skill investment may be individually optimal given their environment, but it may not maximize children’s human capital in the long run. In this sense, the existing school cutoff date may distort students’ and their parents’ skill investment behavior. Our finding is also relevant for equity. Even though month-of-birth gaps may narrow over time, the cost of catching up with peers may be paid by younger students and their parents through their compensatory investment. Policies mitigating month-of-birth effects could correct the distortion in skill investment and improve equity.====Second, taking advantage of the large data set with over 1 million observations, we provide precise estimates for the month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills. Unlike academic test scores, evidence for the month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills is relatively scarce despite the growing recognition of returns to such skills. Datar and Gottfried (2015) find that being relatively old in a kindergarten in the U.S. is associated with better social-behavioral outcomes during elementary school. Peña and Duckworth (2018) and Peña (2020) also showed that older children in a grade cohort score higher in grit, empathy, and decision-making among Mexican students at age 18. Our evidence from Japan complements the previous studies because the month-of-birth effects can vary across countries because of differential education systems. In addition, our data are much larger than the previous studies, which gives added confidence in the results.====Our results also provide a possible explanation for why month of birth has long-term consequences in some countries. For example, Kawaguchi (2011) finds that the youngest men in a grade cohort in Japan earn 4% less income when aged 30–34 years. Although month-of-birth effects on cognitive skills may disappear because of maturation and compensatory skill investment, less sports and music experience, as well as poorer interpersonal relationships with teachers and peers, may harm the long-term development of noncognitive skills, which might account for the lower earnings seen in adulthood. Although we do not observe noncognitive skills after grade nine in our data, this hypothesis is consistent with findings by Chetty et al. (2011), Heckman et al. (2013), and Baker et al. (2019), who find that interventions during childhood affect noncognitive skills in adulthood.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide a conceptual framework. In Section 3, we outline the empirical strategy to identify month-of-birth effects and validate our identifying assumptions. In Section 4, we describe our data. In Section 5, we estimate month-of-birth effects on skills and high school quality. In Section 6, we estimate month-of-birth gaps in time use and interpersonal relationships. In Section 7, we discuss the results in the context of the literature. We conclude in Section 8.

I examine this question in the context of Indonesia's major unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programmes, rolled out in a targeted manner in response to adverse economic shocks. Identification is based on a generalised difference-in-differences with propensity score matching approach exploiting three waves of nationally-representative longitudinal data on household transfer receipts and labour market outcomes. Annual retrospective data in each survey wave allows me to look at immediate effects, potentially important due to the transient nature of the transfers. Consistent with the income and substitution effects, when cash transfers are distributed using a more precise proxy-means test and current, dynamic welfare information, beneficiaries are more likely to adjust their labour supply in order to qualify for or maintain their benefits. Individuals with lower skill levels show a more pronounced response, with a significant decrease in both employment and job formality. The larger effect on job formality highlights the importance of the adjustment margin through the substitution effect associated with the targeting design.","Many developing countries recently increased social protection spending, with targeted cash transfer programmes as a key anti-poverty tool (Barrientos & Hulme, 2009; Devereux & Sabates-Wheeler, 2004; Estevez-Abe et al., 2001). While transfers can improve education, health, and other welfare outcomes among poor households (Gerard et al., 2020; Hanlon et al., 2012; Norton et al., 2002), there may be reduced work incentives and a greater inclination towards informal employment (Blau & Robins, 1986; Borjas, 2016; Moffitt, 2002b). Protecting the poor and alleviating hardship during economic downturns through cash transfer may thus potentially undermine economic recovery if it has disincentive effects in labour markets. The disincentive effects of social assistance programs on employment are significant policy concerns influencing how these programs develop in the future. This paper measures the labour market impacts of Indonesia's large-scale unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programs intended explicitly as crisis stimulus, with a particular emphasis on employment, job formality, and mobility.====The Indonesian government launched its first large-scale cash transfer programme in 2005 in line with a significant reform of its fuel subsidy programme, reallocating a part of the fuel subsidy savings to poor and vulnerable households. Despite its success in administering the assistance at the right time to alleviate potential negative impacts (Bazzi et al., 2015), it is not clear how such cash transfers affect labour market behaviour (see Al Izzati et al., 2020; World Bank, 2012 for several earlier studies of UCT in Indonesia). Most early work examining the labour market effects of social assistance focused on developed countries, and tended to find negative impacts on negative labour supply and work effort, largely due to generous welfare systems (see Burtless, 1986; Chan & Moffitt, 2018; Dague et al., 2017; Hoynes & Schanzenbach, 2012; Jacob & Ludwig, 2012; Moffitt, 2002). In the context of developing countries, empirical evidence is limited, and effects tend to be around zero (e.g., Alzúa et al., 2013; Banerjee et al., 2017). Many programs studied to date only produce income effects because targeting relies on proxy-means tests that are rarely reassessed and exclude labour market outcomes (Gerard et al., 2021). Means-tested programs, in contrast, could potentially distort beneficiaries’ incentives to work through substitution effects, especially in the formal economy where earnings are verifiable (Bergolo & Cruces, 2021; Levy, 2010).====By drawing on the case study of ==== (BLT) 2005, BLT 2008, and ==== (BLSM) 2013, administered by the Indonesian government in a targeted manner, I examine the aggregate effects of social transfers on labour market outcomes by capturing both income and substitution effects. A standard labour supply model predicts that beneficiaries are less likely to seek out or maintain employment as a result of relatively higher unearned income (income effect). Beneficiaries may also experience a substitution effect, and be less likely to take on formal employment since higher formal earnings could render them ineligible for the transfers. Since formal sector income is more easily verifiable, beneficiaries may avoid formal employment due to the consequently non-zero marginal tax rate. Thus, the targeting approach of cash transfer programmes determines the magnitude of any disincentive effects. However, since these UCTs essentially act as temporary fiscal stimulus, negligible effects could be the case, especially in the long run.====Due to the targeted nature of the UCT programmes, it is often difficult to obtain statistically equivalent treatment and control groups to analyse social assistance's impacts. In practice, targeting was imperfect, with inclusion and exclusion errors abound. As a result, beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries should not differ based on observable features, and identification could exploit targeting errors. However, household and community characteristics here are statistically different, including in ways that may be correlated with treatment assignment and labour market outcomes. Therefore, I use generalised difference-in-differences (DD) with propensity score matching (PSM) to recover the effects of these UCT programmes. Since the UCTs are aimed at low-income households, specifically the poorest 30 percent, I complement the DD estimation with PSM to adjust my comparisons for any observable factors potentially determining treatment. The DD estimation is then carried out with individual fixed effects and observations in common support. Individual-level annual panel data spanning over 14 years are constructed from the retrospective answers of employment from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS)—waves 3, 4, and 5—which also allow me to conduct event studies to explore dynamic effects and, in particular, whether any impacts are transitory or persistent.====I find statistically significant evidence of disincentives on employment and job formality consistent with both income and substitution effects, especially for BLT 2008/BLSM 2013. For the BLT 2005, however, there is an increased likelihood of formal employment, albeit with a two-year lag. The mixed results across settings may be partly explained by the differences in targeting approaches used in BLT 2005 and BLT 2008/BLSM 2013. Compared to BLT 2005, which relied on a standard proxy-means test, BLT 2008/BLSM 2013 used a broader range of indicators, including information on employment and occupation combined with community-based targeting. Using a more detailed proxy-means test in conjunction with more recent, dynamic welfare data may have stronger disincentive effects if these criteria are known to potential beneficiaries. Indeed, these disincentives are small and account for only a 2-percentage-point decline in employment and job formality (2 and 8 percent decrease from the mean outcome, respectively). The delayed positive effect on job formality from BLT 2005 may be due to higher labour demand in the formal sector, for example, due to local multiplier effects and alleviating liquidity constraints in searching for better jobs (Baird et al., 2018; Egger et al., 2022; Neri et al., 2013).====This paper closely relates to World Bank (2012) and Al Izzati et al. (2020), which also evaluate the impacts of UCTs in Indonesia. World Bank (2012) examines the effect of UCTs (in either BLT 2005 or 2008) using the National Socio-economic Survey (SUSENAS), a repeat cross-section, finding that UCT beneficiaries, on average, were not more likely to find or leave work. However, beneficiaries of BLT 2005 in the bottom three deciles were 10 percentage points more likely to report moving into employment. Al Izzati et al. (2020) use the main IFLS panel in the years 2000, 2007, and 2014 (i.e., not the annual retrospective data) to find that, among those already working, receiving the UCT has no statistically significant effects on working hours or activities in a farm or nonfarm business. Here, I additionally use IFLS’ retrospective responses, allowing evaluation with individual fixed effects and of short-term effects, a crucial but neglected dimension given the temporary nature of these crisis-response UCTs.====This paper thus makes three main contributions relative to prior work. First, I incorporate job formality and mobility, two important dimensions receiving relatively little attention to date. In the context of social assistance programmes using means-tested targeting, it is particularly important to account for the aggregate effects of cash transfer, especially in the formal sector. Recent studies (see Banerjee et al., 2017, Foguel & Barros, 2010; Galasso, 2006; Maluccio & Flores, 2005; Parker & Skoufias, 2000; Skoufias & Di Maro, 2008) tend to find little evidence of employment effect from cash transfers focusing mainly on the income effects, whereas the substitution effects—the margin of employment most likely affected from salient means testing—are often overlooked. Second, I add to emergent work focused on developing countries' evidence based on rich, high-frequency longitudinal data with a good recall quality to examine whether any labour market responses to cash transfers are temporary or long-lasting. Third, I also provide a relatively novel exploration of treatment effect heterogeneity, not only based on different types of beneficiaries but also the different types of UCT designs, including how different approaches to means-testing may affect various margins of adjustment.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses previous work and provides a background on Indonesia's UCT programmes. Section 3 and Section 4 describe the data and empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the main results, followed by heterogeneity analysis and robustness checks in Sections 6 and 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes with policy implications.","Does Social Assistance Disincentivise Employment, Job Formality, and Mobility?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000738,Available online 29 May 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

This paper argues that the disappearance of middling jobs can drive changes in mobility, notably by removing a stepping stone towards high-paying occupations for those from less well-off family backgrounds. Using data from two British cohorts who entered the labour market at two points in time with very different degrees of employment polarization, we examine how parental income affects both entry occupations and occupational upgrading over careers. We find that transitions across occupations are key to mobility and that the impact of parental income has grown over time. At regional level, using a shift-share IV-strategy, we show that the impact of parental income has increased the most in regions experiencing the greatest increase in polarisation. This indicates that the disappearance of middling jobs played a role in the observed decline in mobility.","Over the last few decades a number of countries have witnessed a decline in income and social mobility that has strengthened the link between individuals’ origins and their socio-economic outcomes. At the same time, the shares in total employment of low- and high-paying occupations have increased at the expense of that of middling occupations, transforming the availability of jobs for workers. Existing work has proposed several explanations for the reduction in mobility, but little attention has been paid to the role of the changing structure of employment despite the fact that both phenomena have taken place roughly simultaneously.==== Yet the timing of the two trends raises the question of whether individuals from less well-off backgrounds can still climb the social ladder as the middle rungs become scarce.====This paper bridges the gap between the literature on social mobility and that on employment polarization. The question has recently been addressed in two closely related papers, Guo (2022) and Hennig (2022), which focus on the impact that the structure of employment has on education decisions in the US. Their conceptual frameworks maintain that, when higher education is costly and borrowing to finance it is not possible, the disappearance of middling jobs results in a polarization of education which in turn leads to lower income mobility. We explore an alternative mechanism that does not rely on costly education, making it applicable to a broader range of economies. Our key hypothesis is that occupational transitions during an individual’s career are an essential aspect of inter-generational mobility. In fact, the UK data we employ indicate that about 30% of those starting in middling occupations and 40% of those starting in low-paying occupations experience upwards occupational mobility between their mid-20s and their early-40s. Our analysis hence focuses on the role of middling jobs as stepping stones in the occupational ladder.====We start by developing a model aimed at illustrating a simple mechanism through which polarization may affect occupational mobility. We consider a setup with two employment periods and three occupations, low-paying, middling, and high-paying. Individuals differ in parental income, which can be either low or high, and which determines first-period human capital, so that when individuals are young those with low parental income are randomly allocated to either low-paying or middling jobs, and those with high parental income to middling or high-paying jobs. During the first period, individuals may increase their human capital through on-the-job learning, which occurs with a given probability that depends on the occupation. In the second period, firms observe the human capital of mature workers and reallocate them across occupations.====We make two crucial assumptions: first, that the probability of on-the-job learning is higher for middling than for low-paying occupations; second, that on-the-job learning is sufficiently strong for an individual from a low-income household to potentially have higher human capital than some individuals from high-income backgrounds. In this context, the availability of middling jobs is the key element determining the extent of mobility. When middling jobs are scarce, the majority of those from low-income backgrounds will start their careers in low-paying occupations. As a result, few of them have learning opportunities and thus only a few individuals with low-income parents will be promoted to high-paying jobs. Moreover, this implies that since few positions are left vacant in middling occupations, few of those who started in high-paying occupations will be demoted, even if they failed to learn. As a result, there is a lower degree of mobility when middling jobs are scarce than when they are plentiful.====The core of our analysis is an empirical assessment of occupational mobility using data from two mature British cohorts, the National Child Development Study (NCDS58) and the British Cohort Study (BCS70). The surveys cover individuals born in, respectively, 1958 and 1970 for whom we have full activity histories along with parental income. These data have been widely used to examine the extent of mobility in the UK and existing work indicates that parent-child income mobility has declined for the younger cohort as compared to the older one.==== We depart from existing work in two respects. First, because we are interested in the structure of employment, mobility is not defined in terms of income, as economists tend to do; rather, we focus on occupations and define occupational categories in line with the employment polarization literature.==== Second, while existing work on inter-generational mobility focuses on the correlation between parental characteristics and the outcomes of mature children, we argue that it is important to disentangle changes in mobility that are due to the ==== component—defined as the transition between the entry job and the job when mature—from those due to the individual’s initial job. The data allow us to consider occupational outcomes both at the start of individuals’ careers, i.e. in their twenties, and when workers are mature, i.e. in their forties, and hence to consider occupations held at different stages of the working life.====To disentangle changes in social mobility that are due to the ==== component—defined as the transition between the entry job and the job when mature—from those due to the ==== component, we proceed in two steps, estimating first the impact of parental income on the child’s first-period occupation and then the effect of first-period occupation and parental income on occupation at age 42.==== We hence ask whether the decline in mobility observed over the period is due to a greater impact of parental background on entry jobs or if the change has occurred mainly through differences in transition probabilities over the child’s lifetime.====Our focus is the comparison between the 1958 cohort and the 1970 cohort. Our data indicate that the polarization that has been observed at the aggregate level in prior work also appears when we consider the employment structure for each cohort. The change in the structure of employment has been particularly marked regarding first-period occupations. Those born in 1958 entered the labour market when middling jobs were plentiful, while those born in 1970 faced greater employment polarization, raising the question of whether intra-generational mobility was lower for the cohort who faced a lower share of middling jobs.====To understand the relationship between polarization and mobility, we measure both at the regional level. We consider differences in the impact of parental income on occupational outcomes across large regions, and construct for each region a measure of employment polarization for each cohort. This measure is constructed as a shift-share based on national level changes, the intuition being that the regions where middling jobs were more prevalent before the period of analysis were also the regions where the increase in employment polarization has been the largest. We then regress regional changes in mobility on regional changes in polarization, using an IV approach in which we instrument changes in the share of the various occupations in the UK with those observed in other European economies.====Our analysis provides three main results. The first concerns the fact that intra-generational mobility is an essential aspect of the observed correlation between parent and child outcomes. For both cohorts, we find that individuals face a large likelihood of changing occupational category over their career. Notably, around 23% (30%) of those initially in low-paying (middling) occupations are in high-paying occupations when they are 42. In fact, for those who started in low-paying and middling occupations, less than half remain in the same occupation as mature workers, with the probabilities both of moving upwards and downwards being large. Persistence is much higher for those starting in the best-paid jobs, but nevertheless, a third of them experience downwards mobility. Our results hence imply that it is important to understand career dynamics in order to explain the transmission of economic outcomes across generations.====Second, we find that the increased impact of family background on children’s incomes identified in previous work also appears when we focus on occupations. Moreover, the reduction in mobility is apparent at all the stages that determine an individual’s occupation when mature. The effect of parental income on first-period occupation and that on the job when mature—controlling for initial occupation—have both become stronger for the younger cohort. These results raise the question of what are the implications of the disappearance of middling jobs for mobility. On the one hand, fewer individuals have access to those jobs when young, and those who do tend to come from better-off backgrounds; on the other, whether or not those in middling jobs move to high-paying occupations is more dependent on parental income for the younger than for the older cohort. The overall outcome are increased differences in intra-generational mobility according to family background. For those at the top of the parental-income distribution, upwards mobility during the working life has risen by about 5 percentage points, both for those starting in low-paid or middling jobs; in contrast, it has declined by around 8 percentage points for those from less well-off families, irrespective of the job initially held. That is, we observe that the possibility of career progression has become more dependent on parental background.====Lastly, the regional dimension of our data indicates that employment polarization tends to decrease mobility. Using a shift-share IV strategy we show that a decline in the regional share of middling employment increased the impact of parental income on the child’s occupational outcome, indicating that mobility declined most in regions with greater polarization. This conclusion is supported by the finding, when using individual data, that the effect of parental income on occupational outcomes is stronger for individuals who—when young—lived in areas with greater job polarization.====Our work is related to three strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the determinants of inter-generational mobility which has extensively documented the parent-child dynamics in income and social class.==== Much of the focus has been on how individual characteristics affect income dynamics across generations, notably education, non-cognitive skills, personality traits, and quality of the neighbourhood.==== Yet, little attention has been paid to the importance of early labour market experiences. This paper thus provides a bridge between the literatures on ==== and ==== mobility by focusing on access to jobs at the beginning of the career and the subsequent career dynamics, and shows that understanding ==== mobility is essential to understand an individual’s outcome when mature.====The idea that lifecycle dynamics are important when examining inter-generational mobility has been explored by a body of work focusing on the bias resulting from the fact that we generally only have a snapshot of the child’s outcomes rather than their lifetime income; see Jenkins (1987).==== This literature has explored the relationship between point-in-time and lifetime earnings and found that the estimated effect of parental background is larger the later in the lifecycle the child’s outcome is measured, as shown, for example, by Haider and Solon (2006). Similar results are obtained for the UK by Gregg et al. (2017) using the same cohort data as we do. Our paper makes two contributions to this literature. Existing work has compared the impact of parental background on income at different stages of the child’s lifecycle, and we show that a similar result appears when we focus on occupations, which are usually deemed to be more stable than incomes. Moreover, our results help understand the source of the lifecycle bias as they highlight that parental income affects occupational transitions during the child’s early working years.====Second, our paper is part of the recent literature in economics that has identified a decline in income mobility, notably in the US and the UK, and our contribution lies in showing that the increased importance of parental income also appears when we focus on the child’s occupational outcome. In doing so, we build a bridge between the approach followed by economists and that used by sociologists. The former have focused on the relationship between parent and child incomes, while the latter have examined the transmission of social class, itself based on occupations. The decline in income mobility identified by economists is less apparent when focusing on social class, as argued by Goldthorpe (2013) who maintains that when looking at the effect of parental class on the child’s class the main change in the late 20th century is a levelling out of the increasing rates of upwards absolute mobility observed in earlier decades. Our framework follows the sociology literature in seeking to explain the child’s occupational outcome, yet we use parental income as our key measure of family status, and when doing so we observe a decline in absolute mobility. Our results can be reconciled with the findings by sociologist if within an occupational group the children of those with higher incomes have become more likely to experience upwards occupational mobility than they were in the past.====The literature on the increased influence of parental income on children’s income in the UK has found that this effect operates largely through educational attainment. For example, Blanden et al. (2007), using the same data as us, find that the increase in the effect of parental income is mainly due to a strengthening of the effect of family background on educational attainment and on non-cognitive skills.==== Our analysis complements this approach in two ways. On the one hand, we emphasize the importance of the structure of employment for mobility. As is well-established, both greater educational attainment and non-cognitive skills lead to better-paid occupations, which in turn determines incomes. We argue that the availability of employment opportunities is essential in order to turn these skills into higher incomes. On the other hand, such work has emphasized the growing importance of parental income for the acquisition of skills, which can be acquired at home or in the classroom; our analysis highlights the importance of initial occupations, which are themselves an additional potential source of learning and skill acquisition.====Lastly, this paper adds to our understanding of the consequences of employment polarization. Economists have mainly focused on the distribution of earnings,==== although there is some work on its impact on educational attainment or the labour supply (Spitz-Oener, 2006, Verdugo, Allègre, 2020). The task approach introduced by Autor et al. (2003) implies that biased technological change results in both the polarization of employment and a change in wages, and much work has been devoted to trying to understand to what extent polarization has driven observed increases in earnings inequality. Surprisingly, the question of whether employment polarization affects mobility has been largely ignored. To our knowledge, the only exceptions are Arntz et al. (2022); Guo (2022); Hennig (2022) and Berger and Engzell (2022).====Guo (2022) and Hennig (2022) share a focus on educational decisions and how the disappearance of routine jobs affects the incentives to invest in education, which in turn results in a polarization of education and of wages, as well as in lower inter-generational mobility. These predictions are shown to be consistent with the cross-sectional correlation between polarization and local mobility measures, where the latter are those obtained by Chetty et al. (2014a) for US commuting zones. Our analysis complements their work in several ways. First, in their setup the occupation of mature workers is determined exclusively by their educational choice; we add the analysis of job-to-job transitions and show that these transitions are essential to understand inter-generational mobility. Second, since these authors rely on the cost of education as a driver of the mechanism they study, their analysis is not suitable for economies where this cost is small or null, as is often the case in Europe. We hence provide a mechanism that is more widely applicable. Lastly, measures of income mobility pull together changes in occupational outcomes and in wages in the different occupations, yet these two have varied in different ways depending on the country. Notably, while in the US mature workers have experienced an increase in wage polarization, this has not been the case in the UK.==== Our approach isolates the dynamics of occupations, thus providing a more direct link between the structure of employment and individuals’ labour market outcomes.====Also related are Arntz et al. (2022) and Berger and Engzell (2022). The approach in Berger and Engzell (2022) is close to that in Guo (2022) and Hennig (2022). Using the same US data for commuting-zone income mobility, they find a negative correlation between the local use of robots and the extent of inter-generational income mobility. Arntz et al. (2022) focus on the wages of individuals with different parental backgrounds and how they are affected by technology. Their evidence for Germany indicates that, for individuals with higher education, an increase in the use of computer-controlled tools is associated with a smaller wage gap between those with high-income and low-income parents. This result indicates that technology can sometimes offset the effect parental background, in contrast to the results for the US, and highlights the importance of examining these questions for countries other than the United States.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We start by presenting a simple model of the effect of employment polarization on occupational mobility in Section 2. Section 3 presents the cohort data and describes the structure of employment for the two cohorts along with their occupational dynamics. Our empirical specification distinguishes between the effect of parental income on initial occupations and on the transition across occupations during the individual’s career, and the results are presented in Section 4, examining the changes that have occurred across the two cohorts. Section 5 estimates mobility at the regional level and provides evidence on the correlation across regions between the extent of job polarization and changes in mobility.

To address the self-selection issue, we use both an instrumental variable (IV) and nonparametric bounding approaches. Our results show that the overall return on Mandarin proficiency is positive, ranging from 10.5% to 49.9% across the whole sample. A driving mechanism is that workers with a high Mandarin proficiency are more likely to find jobs that match their expertise, which then increases their productivity in the workplace. We also find that the returns are heterogeneous across different subgroups: (1) Women benefit more than men, which suggests that language proficiency can help reduce the gender wage gap; (2) The return on Mandarin proficiency is statistically significant and positive for young and middle-aged workers, but there is not enough evidence for older workers; (3) The return is larger for individuals living in urban areas than those in rural areas. In addition, we find that the IV method cannot be extrapolated to obtain the marginal returns across different treatment groups, as its coefficient is incredibly large, thus overestimating the economic returns on Mandarin proficiency.","To many, Mandarin is often perceived as the only language in China, synonymous with ""Chinese."" This is actually not true. China is a linguistically diverse country with hundreds of local languages and dialects, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible. More importantly, the differences among these local languages are far greater than many would think. In fact, as noted by Dovì (2019) and Tang and van Heuven (2009), the mutual intelligibility (measured by word-intelligibility and sentence intelligibility) of the dialects in China can be as low as 2%, and does not surpass 50% on average.====Not only did such great linguistic differences create communication barriers between people from different regions in China, but the Chinese government also considered them to have adversely affected economic progress and cultural exchange. As a result, the Chinese government has been promoting the standardization of the spoken Chinese language since the 1950s, gradually settling on Mandarin as the standard spoken language and describing it as a common speech with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect. In 1956, the government issued The State Council Directive on the Promotion of Putonghua, which aimed to popularize Mandarin and promote its use in schools, and in many aspects of daily life and official government activities. In 2000, the use of Mandarin became law (Jiang, 2000), with Mandarin being further established as the official national language in 2010 by China's National Language Law.====Because Mandarin essentially developed from a dialect, it is not necessarily well understood by many in China. Despite the great promotion effort, around 30% of the population is still unable to communicate in Mandarin, which led some scholars to conclude that ""for most Chinese people, Mandarin is somewhere between being a native language, an intelligible dialect, and an almost ‘foreign’ language."" (Dovì, 2019). Because of this, Mandarin should be considered as more of a lingua franca in the Chinese labor market, and its role should be similar to the role that English plays in the global economy or in those countries where English is one of the official languages (e.g., India). Proficiency in the official language of a country has been shown to be positively related to one's earnings. For example, Azam, Chin, and Prakash (2013) found that in India, where English is one of the national languages but English proficiency levels remain low, there exists a sizable effect of English skills on wages, whereby the returns on English proficiency are even higher than the returns on education. This raises the question of whether Mandarin skills are similarly profitable in the Chinese labor market, especially for migrants, which is what we investigate in this paper.====According to the literature on the economics of language, there are a few reasons why a higher level of language skills can be associated with higher earnings. First, the use of a common language can reduce the communication barrier and increase the quality of job opportunities, which could increase one's productivity in the workplace (Grogger, 2011; Yao & van Ours, 2019). Overcoming the communication barrier may also expand one's social network, which is an important job search channel in China. Second, language skills can often serve as a signal of one's ability and thus increase their likelihood of employment, especially as they are more directly observable when compared to other skills. Dovì (2019) supports this statement by showing that a one standard deviation increase in Mandarin proficiency increases employment chances by 4% in the whole sample and by up to roughly 5% in only those individuals residing in urban areas of China.====Both aforementioned reasons suggest a causal impact of language skills on earnings. However, the positive association between language skills and earnings may also be a spurious one, capturing the effects of omitted variables, or reflecting reverse causality. First, better language skills may be related to unobservable variables (e.g., quality of education) that are positively related to earnings. Effort and time spent on improving one's language skills can also diminish the resources spent on other productive skills which are not necessarily measured in the data (e.g., quantitative ability as reported by Dovì, 2019). Second, the need for communication skills may be more prevalent in high-skilled or high-paying jobs, and language skills can improve in such a workplace, as employees have more opportunities to practice (Dovì, 2019).====The key challenge faced by studies of the economic returns on Mandarin skills is indeed to isolate the causal impact of language skills. Common approaches to address this challenge include the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, propensity score matching (PSM; Saiz et al., 2002), or the instrumental variable method (IV; Ginsburgh & Prieto-Rodriguez, 2011; Wang, Smyth, & Cheng, 2017). Both the OLS and PSM approaches rely primarily on the conditional independence assumption that requires language skills to be exogenous once the control variables are included in the model. The IV approach relies on the existence of an IV variable that is not only strongly correlated with language skills, but also uncorrelated with the unobservable determinants of earnings, and that does not affect earnings either directly or indirectly through any channels other than language skills. For example, Dovì (2019) utilized language use outside of the workplace and migration history as IVs.====However, the independence or exogeneity assumption is often difficult to satisfy and cannot be directly tested in practice. Moreover, both OLS and IV approaches typically impose linearity on the relationship between language skills and earnings, hence assuming that the returns on language skills are homogeneous. While these challenges are well known, convincing solutions addressing them together have proven unsuccessful, thereby calling for alternative approaches. In this paper, we employ a nonparametric bounds analysis that relies on more transparent and weaker assumptions, which are in part testable. Since the approach is nonparametric, it also allows us to uncover variations in the returns on language skills across the levels of such skills.====To perform our analysis, we utilize data from the 2016 wave of the nationwide China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), which is a longitudinal survey administered by Sun Yat-Sen University. The CLDS dataset is nationally representative, designed to survey individual-, family-, as well as community-level characteristics with an emphasis on surveying labor market outcomes such as job conditions, income sources, and educational information (Wang, Zhou, & Liu, 2017). The 2016 survey wave represents the most recent available CLDS data, which specifically focuses on the labor market and demographic characteristics of the respondents. One unique advantage of CLDS data is that each respondent's Mandarin proficiency was objectively assessed by the interviewers, which reduces the subjective measurement error of this variable. We do indeed find a Mandarin premium in the Chinese labor market, which is represented by higher wages. The positive effects are a result of better job matches and higher levels of productivity. In addition, we show that, while the returns on wages are positive for both male and female workers, highly proficient Mandarin skills benefit women more than men, which can potentially help narrow the gender wage gap. Finally, we show that the IV analyses usually result in high values and are sometimes overestimated.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature; section 3 describes the data; section 4 presents and discusses the empirical methods that are employed; sections 5 and 6 present the results; section 7 discusses the potential mechanisms influencing the results; section 8 contrasts the nonparametric results with traditional parametric results; and section 9 concludes the paper.",The Economic Value of Language in China: How Important is Mandarin Proficiency in the Chinese Labor Market?

We find that the connectedness of a student’s advisor in the coauthor network significantly improves her job market outcome. We use two identification strategies and find that a) higher Eigenvector centrality of an adviser leads to her student getting placed at a better ranked institution, and b) larger distance between an adviser and an institution decreases the probability that her students are placed there. Our study sheds light on the importance of social connections in a labour market where information frictions regarding job openings are virtually absent.","The labour market for academic economists, organised annually by the American Economic Association, is a crucial event for graduate students, their advisers, and hiring institutions (Coles et al., 2010). As with many labour markets, hiring institutions often face uncertainty regarding applicant quality (Chandrasekhar et al., 2020). This could be because hiring committees may not have the time or resources to thoroughly review all applications, or may struggle to assess certain intangible qualities such as collegiality. This uncertainty can lead to suboptimal hiring. For example, since better ranked institutions are likely to get many applications, and are simultaneously likely to have a lower tolerance for candidate uncertainty, we may observe some good students being under placed. Smeets et al. (2006) show that top students from good programs often outperform the average student from elite programs. One reason why the former were not accepted to the elite PhD programs could be uncertainty regarding PhD applicant quality.====Academic advisers can reduce uncertainty about student quality and ability via reference letters and phone calls (Athey, Katz, Krueger, Levitt, Poterba, 2016, Colander, 1997). Colander (1997) writes that “Recommendations from important people are extremely important” and “Informal contacts - and phone calls by your advisers and friends - are important”. In this paper, we show that an adviser’s connectedness in the coauthor network positively affects her student’s first placement after graduate school.====Apart from the above mentioned direct channel, there are at least three indirect channels through which a more connected adviser may help her student secure a better placement: a) they spread information about their students in their academic network, b) an adviser’s network may be utilised by the student to write more and better papers, and c) hiring committees may (unconsciously) spend more time with the applications of students of well known advisers. Advisers advertise their students and their students’ job market paper among coauthors or at conferences. This information then diffuses further in their network via informal interactions. When student applications are examined, the students of well-connected advisers benefit from the lower uncertainty about their match. Baruffaldi et al. (2016) demonstrate such a mechanism for direct links. They show that PhD students who obtained their Masters degree at an affiliation of their adviser’s coauthor are more productive than PhD students coming from a university to which their adviser has no links. The second indirect mechanism points out that hiring committees may reason that students have access to their adviser’s network and may therefore turn out to be more productive than students of less connected advisers. This would provide an edge to applications of students of well connected advisers, leading to them obtaining placements at better ranked institutions.==== Finally, the third indirect mechanism suggests that if hiring committees spend more time on the applications of students of well known advisers then this can increase the probability of getting an interview/fly-out for those students.====We use two different identification strategies and outcome variables to show that an adviser’s connectedness positively affects her student’s placement. First, we utilise the changes in the centrality of the adviser’s coauthors in the year of a student’s placement as an exogenous shock to the adviser’s Eigenvector centrality to show that higher centrality of an adviser leads to better placement outcomes for her students. Second, we use the death of Economists as an exogenous shock to show that the probability of a student being placed at a particular university reduces when the ‘social distance’ between her adviser and that university increases due to the death. In both settings, our coauthor network compromises up to 40,000 Economists based on joint publications.====Our measure of connectedness in the first identification strategy is the adviser’s Eigenvector centrality score in the coauthor network. This captures the value of not just the adviser’s direct connections but also her indirect connections via the connectedness of her neighbours, and so on. The idea behind this measure is that people connected to more connected individuals are themselves more connected. Various studies demonstrate the importance of Eigenvector centrality (for examples - see Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, Jackson, 2013, Calvó-Armengol, Patacchini, Zenou, 2009, Cruz, Labonne, Querubin, 2017). We instrument an adviser’s Eigenvector centrality by the average Eigenvector centrality of her coauthors as measured in a network where we artificially removed the adviser. Changes in the connectedness of the adviser’s coauthors in the year of a student’s graduation provide the exogenous variation needed for identification. Our analysis indicates that a one standard deviation change in the centrality of the adviser leads, on average, to her student getting a placement at an institution with a 0.692 standard deviation higher score. The mean change in adviser centrality (year on year across all advisers in our sample) is around 0.013 standard deviations. This corresponds to an improvement in placement rank by about 6 ranks.====The other identification strategy studies the effect of social distance on placement probability - are students more likely to be hired by an institution whose faculty members are close to their adviser in the coauthor network? Our identification utilizes unexpected distance increases caused by the deaths of authors in the coauthor network. We find that if the distance between an adviser and a university increases by one, the probability of that adviser’s student being placed at that university declines by about 0.2 percentage points.====Generally, there are two channels through which social networks affect the labour market: learning about new job openings (Boorman, 1975, Calvó-Armengol, 2004, Calvó-Armengol, Zenou, 2005, Granovetter, 1973), and reducing uncertainty about the applicant (Burks, Cowgill, Hoffman, Housman, 2017, Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, 2016, Montgomery, 1991). With the exception of San (2021), labour economists are usually unable to empirically distinguish between the two channels. Our setting, the academic job market for Economists, is special in that information frictions regarding job openings are (almost) absent due to Job Openings for Economists. Thus, our finding that social networks play a role in this market is likely because they help decrease the uncertainty about an applicant’s quality.====Our study differs from previous studies on social networks in labour markets in another way. Prior work on social networks in the labour market are usually limited to the impact of direct links. For example, Kramarz and Skans (2014) look at the direct link between parents and children and establish that this connection is important for the job market outcome of the children. Burks et al. (2017) and Hensvik and Skans (2016) show that workers recommended by current employees are often a better match for the firm, confirming the model of Montgomery (1991). Dustmann et al. (2016) assume that the network of connections is along ethnic lines, by proxying referral hires by the share of workers in the firm with the same ethnicity as the applicant. San (2021) moves one step beyond direct links and finds that workers are more likely to work in firms where their parents’ past coworkers are working. In contrast to these studies, we construct a large network of connections using coauthor links and capture the effects of even distant indirect connections via the centrality of the adviser in this network.====Note that even though there are no ‘advisers’ in other labour markets, we point out that links with more connected individuals are more valuable in a job search than links with less connected individuals. This message will ring true for any labour market with information frictions.====Finally, we contribute to the understanding of the academic job market for Economists. Oyer (2006) points out that the first placement of graduate students has a significant impact on their careers. Our research demonstrates how an adviser’s connectedness can influence her student’s first placement. The role of the adviser has also been explored by Krueger and Wu (2000), who report a correlation between the (subjective) prominence of the student’s recommendation letter writer and the student’s placement. We show that even after controlling for ‘prominence’ (which we equate with a productivity-based measure), the connectedness of the adviser matters for her students’ placement.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The data construction and description is in Section 2. Section 3 presents a discussion of our empirical strategies and challenges. Our empirical analysis in Section 4 proceeds in two parts - the first part examines the effect of adviser centrality on placement outcome, while the second part examines the effect of social distance on placement probability. In Section 5, we discuss various channels via which adviser centrality could influence student placement, and Section 6 conclude our paper.",Adviser connectedness and placement outcomes in the economics job market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000726,24 May 2023,2023,Research Article,8.0

Differences in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers are strongly driven by worker selection and systematic sorting. Ignoring these selection effects can lead to biased expectations about the consequences of working part-time on wages (’selection neglect bias’). Based on representative survey data from Germany, we document substantial misperceptions of the part-time wage gap. Workers strongly overestimate how much part-time workers in their occupation earn per hour, whereas they are approximately informed of mean full-time wage rates. Consistent with selection neglect, those who perceive large hourly pay differences between full-time and part-time workers also predict large changes in hourly wages when a given worker switches between full-time and part-time employment. Causal analyses using a survey experiment reveal that providing information about the raw part-time pay gap increases expectations about the full-time wage premium by factor 1.7, suggesting that individuals draw causal conclusions from observed correlations. De-biasing respondents by informing them about the influence of worker characteristics on observed pay gaps mitigates selection neglect. Subjective beliefs about the part-time/full-time wage gap are predictive of planned and actual transitions between full-time and part-time employment, necessitating the prevention of causal misperceptions.","Many developed countries have advanced access to flexible working arrangements during the last decades, often by easing the transition between full-time and part-time employment through statutory rules (Hegewisch et al., 2009). However, actual take up of part-time employment remains strongly gendered: One in four women in the OECD worked part-time in 2021, but fewer than one in ten men.==== One reason explaining the gap between availability and take up of part-time work is the negative stigma associated with part-time employment (‘flexibility stigma’, see Chung, 2020, Williams, Blair-Loy, Berdahl). Workers associate part-time work with negative career outcomes, including lower chances of promotion (Chung, 2020), as well as short-term (Schrenker, 2023) and long-term wage penalties (Boneva et al., 2021).====In this paper, we study whether workers form expectations about the consequences of working part-time based on misguided causal inference. Previous research shows that individuals often struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation.==== Causal misperceptions can result in behavioral distortions (Spiegler, 2020a), and agents who confuse correlation and causation can be systematically fooled (Horz, Kocak, Spiegler, 2020). One particular challenge when inferring from correlational information is the presence of data selection. Individuals may neglect that they only observe a selective sample when they observe the outcomes of other individuals (‘selection neglect bias’), which can lead to biased expectations about their own outcomes (e.g. Barron, Huck, Jehiel, 2019, Jehiel, 2018, Koehler, Mercer, 2009, López-Pérez, Pintér, Sánchez-Mangas, 2022).====In the context of part-time employment, individuals may try to learn about the consequences of working part-time by observing the career outcomes of other part-time employed workers. However, part-time and full-time workers differ substantially in their characteristics, as well as labor force attachment and work experience (e.g. Blundell, Costa Dias, Meghir, Shaw, 2016, Fernández-Kranz, Paul, Rodríguez-Planas, 2015), so observable differences in pay between part-time workers and full-time workers are strongly driven by worker selection and systematic sorting (e.g. Fernández-Kranz, Rodríguez-Planas, 2011, Manning, Petrongolo, 2008). Existing research documents large raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers in the range of 20 to 30 percent (see Schrenker, 2023, for an overview), whereas estimates of selection-corrected part-time wage penalties are usually much smaller (e.g. Aaronson, French, 2004, Gallego-Granados, 2019, Hirsch, 2005, Manning, Petrongolo, 2008, Matteazzi, Pailhé, Solaz, 2014, Paul, 2016, Schrenker, 2023). Hence, workers who infer from observed pay gaps about the consequences of switching between full-time and part-time work may substantially overestimate the true penalty or premium of working different hours, which may lead to suboptimal labor supply choices.====To examine if workers wrongly draw causal conclusions from average full-time/part-time pay gaps, we ask three research questions. First, do workers believe full-time and part-time workers earn different hourly wage rates? Second, what is the perceived causal effect of switching between full-time and part-time employment for a given worker? Third, how do perceived causal effects relate to perceived raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers, and do beliefs reflect selection neglect?====To answer these questions, we implement a survey module combined with an information experiment in the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016 and 2019. The SOEP-IS is an annual panel survey representative of German households with high quality data collection and face-to-face interviewing.====In the non-experimental part of the survey, we elicit workers’ beliefs about the mean hourly wage rate earned by full-time workers in their occupation, as well as the mean hourly wage rate earned by part-time workers in their occupation. We use these measures to quantify respondents’ beliefs about the perceived difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers. Furthermore, we measure workers’ beliefs about the causal part-time wage penalty. We define the causal part-time penalty as the change in hourly pay that a given worker experiences when switching between full-time and part-time employment. Specifically, we ask respondents to consider a hypothetical scenario of switching between working 40 hours per week and 20 hours per week, ====, and then provide an estimate of the expected change in hourly wage rates associated with this transition. Respondents provide three different estimates for this hypothetical scenario: i) the predicted wage change for an average full-time worker in their occupation switching to a part-time position, ii) the predicted wage change for an average part-time worker in their occupation switching to full-time, and iii) respondents’ self-expected wage change when switching between full- and part-time employment, which depends on the current employment status of the respondent (full- or part-time). The non-experimental survey data allow us to quantify the perceived raw difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers, as well as the perceived causal effect of switching between full- and part-time work. To study selection neglect, we analyze descriptively whether workers distinguish between correlation and causation by examining whether they expect causal effects that are quantitatively similar to the raw wage gap they believe exists between full-time and part-time workers. To test for selection neglect more formally, we further design and implement an information experiment, described next.====The experiment allows us to causally estimate whether workers infer from average pay gaps about the causal part-time penalty. It consists of two treatment groups who receive different information, and one control group who receives no information. Participants are randomly allocated to one of the three groups with equal probability. The first treatment group receives information about the average gap in hourly pay between full-time workers and part-time workers in the German population. We elicit self-beliefs about the causal part-time penalty post treatment, using the same survey instrument as in the non-experimental questionnaire, and exploit the experimentally induced variation in beliefs between the first treatment group and the control group to analyze if individuals draw causal conclusions from correlational information.====We further use the experimental design to study the role of de-biasing and to test whether selection neglect persists when individuals are informed of the data generating process (DGP), as shown in some laboratory settings (Barron et al., 2019) but not others (López-Pérez et al., 2022). To this end, we provide the second treatment group with an alternative information treatment that also reports the average pay gap between full-time and part-time workers, but additionally educates subjects about the selection mechanism driving the observed wage gap. Specifically, the second information treatment points out that observed pay gaps between full-time and part-time workers can largely be explained by differences in work experience.====Finally, we analyze some behavioral implications of worker beliefs about part-time pay. Exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the SOEP-IS, we study descriptively how worker beliefs relate to planned and realized transitions between full-time and part-time employment.====The empirical analyses generate five main findings. First, respondents underestimate the difference in hourly wage rates between full-time and part-time workers in their occupation. Second, workers predict small causal wage penalties for a given worker switching between full- and part-time employment. Third, perceived raw and causal wage gaps are significantly correlated. Fourth, providing correlational information strongly affects beliefs about causal effects. Fifth, de-biasing effectively reduces selection neglect. Taken together, the results provide empirical evidence of causal misperceptions in the context of the part-time wage penalty. Although individuals do not naïvely equate average pay gaps with causal effects, they seem to account only insufficiently for worker selection. In addition, we show that beliefs about part-time pay gaps are predictive of labor supply choices, necessitating the prevention of causal misperceptions to avoid behavioral distortions.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 informs about the existing literature and how this paper relates to it.

Linking this index to individual-level panel data on wages and job transitions, I show that CEI is negatively associated with workers wages: moving from the first quartile to the third quartile of industry specificity decreases wages by 13 percent. I next examine the mechanisms that explain these findings. I first find that CEI is negatively associated with cross-industry and cross-occupation mobility, that is, workers employed in industry-specific occupations change industry and occupation less frequently than workers in less specific occupations. In addition, I show that occupation-level factors such as skill uniqueness and automatability increase industry specificity; but they cannot entirely explain the negative effect of CEI on wages. Finally, in line with the main results, I provide suggestive evidence that workers in industry-specific occupations are more vulnerable to industry-wide wage shocks compared to their generalist counterparts.","The mobility of workers across industries and the transferability of their skills play several crucial roles in economics. First, workers ability to switch industry matters for wages, since workers job mobility determines their outside job options, and thus their bargaining power over earnings (Bivens, Gould, Mishel, Shierholz, 2014, De Loecker, Eeckhout, Unger, 2020, Stansbury, Summers, 2020). Second, cross-industry mobility might be critical for reducing income inequality, as most of the rise in earnings inequality since the 1990s is accounted for by between-industry wage inequality (Haltiwanger et al., 2022). Third, the ability of workers to change industry is critical for the reallocation of labor when industry-specific demand or policy shocks reshape industrial landscapes (Elliott, Lindley, 2006, Neffke, Otto, Hidalgo, Neffke, Otto, Weyh, 2017). Therefore, identifying impediments to workers transferability across industries has essential implications for labor market efficiency and wages. In this regard, recent research posits that the degree of specialization of a workers occupationand therefore her ability to use her skills in a different industryis a possible constraint to her job mobility, and thus a type of search friction (Naidu et al., 2018). As some occupations are more “industry specific” and found in only a few sectors, the ability of workers to change industry decreases, providing firms with wage-setting power, even in the presence of many competing employers (Manning, 2003, Manning, 2021). This hypothesis might have particularly important wage consequences for low-income workers, who often cant compensate for low industry transferability with high-skill wage premiums. However, the empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is still weak.====This paper seeks to answer the following question: ==== I investigate industry specificity as an empirically unexplored source of search frictions for low- and middle-wage American workers; and I hypothesize that industry specificity reduces wages through a decrease in industry mobility.====The contribution of this analysis is twofold. First, I develop an index that captures a concept that has not yet been explored empirically: the degree of industrial specialization of an occupation. Second, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the mobility and wage implications of industry specificity. I present a novel finding with substantial potential policy implications: there exists a negative relationship between the concentration of industries that employ a particular occupation and that occupations pay. I also identify industry specificity as a possible impediment to workers mobility across industries and thus a source of frictions facilitating downward pressure on wages. Finally, I propose an alternative perspective of labor market mobility for workers by emphasizing the importance of an occupation-level characteristic: its degree of concentration of employment among industries.====To capture the concept of industry specificity, I construct a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) defined at the occupation-state-year level that captures the concentration of employment among industries (CEI) for all occupations listed in the 2010 Census classification, in all US states, each year. A high CEI value indicates a highly industry-specific occupation in a given state and year. For example, fast food cook is a highly specific occupation with CEI values above 2500, because that occupation is employed by just a few industries in most states. My index is distinct from HHI indices that capture the geographical concentration of jobs (Azar, Marinescu, Steinbaum, 2022, Benmelech, Bergman, Kim, 2020) in that it captures an occupations transferability across industries instead of local labor market concentration. This paper therefore complements the literature that looks at spatial market concentration as a source of downward pressure on wages by exploring another determinant of workers job transitions: the level of industry specialization of their occupation. Given the increasing evidence that the geographical feature of labor markets is a source of local firm market power (Azar, Marinescu, Steinbaum, 2022, Berger, Herkenhoff, Mongey, 2019, Hershbein, Macaluso, Yeh, 2019, Kahn, Tracy, 2019, Manning, Petrongolo, 2017), industry mobility becomes an important additional mechanism through which workers job opportunities can expand.====I study how industry specificity relates to workers wages. Using occupation-industry-state level OEWS data, I first show that a higher concentration of employment among fewer industries (higher CEI values) is a feature of low- and middle-wage occupations. Next, I link the CEI indices to individual-level data from the Survey of Income Program and Participation (SIPP), which tracked the job transitions and wages of 82,464 individuals on a monthly basis between January 2014 and December 2017. This allows me to measure the degree of industry specificity of each of the occupations an individual has held over the sample period. I explore the relationship between CEI and wages at the individual level using instrumental variable with fixed effects (IV-FE) methods combining approaches from Nevo (2001), Azar et al. (2022) and Doerr et al. (2021). To mitigate concerns about potential omitted variable bias or reverse causality, I instrument industry specificity at the occupation-state-year level by i) the leave-one-out 2012 average values of CEI across all other states for the same occupation and ii) the year ==== predicted average value of CEI across all other states for the same occupation. This second variable predicts the actual evolution in occupation-state level CEI using each occupation-states leave-one-out 2012 CEI value, adjusting it for the nationwide average growth rate in CEI between 2012 and ====.====Next, I analyze the mechanisms through which industry specificity affects wages. First, because high industrial concentration of employment implies that an occupation is employed in few industries, I expect that workers in industry-specific occupations have less agency to switch industry or occupation than individuals in more generalist occupations. This reduction of workers outside job options, in turn, might allow firms within industries to lower wages without necessarily facing higher quit rates. I test this hypothesis by examining how CEI is associated with workers’ transitions across jobs, industries and occupations. Second, I test whether occupation-level characteristics such as automatability, offshorability or the level of uniqueness of an occupations skills can explain part of the association between CEI and wages. For example, industry-specific occupations might be associated with more unique skills, or, put differently, skills that are demanded across fewer industries or occupations. This skill uniqueness might make human capital transfers across occupations and industries more difficult and explains why I observe lower rates of occupation and industry mobility for industry-specific workers. Similarly, the employment of occupations that can be easily offshored or automated might be concentrated among fewer industries as they progressively get replaced by machines or foreign workers. To study these hypotheses, I examine 1) how the levels of skill transferability, automatability and offshorability of an occupation are correlated with that occupations level of industrial concentration of employment and 2) whether these factors can entirely explain away the relationship between CEI on wages. Finally, I explore possible heterogeneous effects of CEI by assessing if workers in industry-specific occupations are more vulnerable to aggregate wage shocks than individuals in less specific occupations.====I find that individuals in more industry-specific occupations have, on average, lower wages: moving from the first quartile to the third quartile of industry specificity decreases wages by 13 percent. This finding is consistent with the idea that industry specificity can be interpreted as a type of search friction providing firms with the ability to retain and hire workers without significant pressure to increase their wages. On the mechanism driving this result, I first show that individuals in more industry-specific occupations change industry and occupation less frequently and become unemployed more often compared to workers in more generalist occupations. This finding suggests that industry-specific workers, while facing more barriers to switch industries and occupations, also face more job instability within their respective sectors and occupations. This result is particularly interesting as it implies that industry-specific workers do not compensate for high industrial specialization by changing occupations more often. It also shows that higher job-to-job transitions are not a wage-compensating mechanism for industry-specific workers.==== Among the occupation-level factors that could possibly explain the relationship between CEI and wages, I find that skill uniqueness and automatability are indeed associated with higher levels of industrial concentration of employment. When I include these factors in a regression of individual wages on CEI, I also find that they are negatively correlated with wages, but that they do not explain away the negative association between CEI and wages. This result suggests that there is not just one factor that explains the negative relationship between CEI and wages but rather a conjunction of factors that can impact the demand for an occupation across industries. Therefore, while the concept of industry specificity is related to skill specificity, it still remains distinct from it and provides something in addition to human capital-based explanations of occupational mobility. Finally, I find a CEI gradient in the effect of industry-level wage shocks on individual wages. In other words, wages of workers in more industry-specific occupations seem more sensitive to changes in industry-level wages than wages of workers in less specific occupations.====This study makes important contributions to the literatures on search frictions in the labor market, occupational specificity, skill transferability, and industrial and occupational mobility. First, this paper relates to the literature on the effect of frictions in labor markets by identifying industry specificity as an impediment to a workers job search. A theoretical cornerstone of this literature is Manning (2003)’s dynamic model of monopsony, in which search frictions provide firms with wage-setting power, even in the presence of many competing firms. Additional studies in this literature identify non-wage job amenities (Ransom, 2022), distance to work (Manning and Petrongolo, 2017), industry skill relatedness (Neffke et al., 2017), and moving costs (Greenaway et al., 2000) as sources of frictions. This paper adds to this line of research by proposing the concept of industry specificity as another type of constraint to a workers job search. Second, because I interpret industry specificity as a constraint to job opportunities, this paper also relates to research that quantifies workers job options and their impact on labor market outcomes. Ueda (2019) argues that working in a locally large industry mitigates the wage drop incurred by laid-off workers. On the question of how skills influence job options, Macaluso (2017) provides evidence that, in any given local market, laid-off workers possessing skills that are in lower demand experience higher wage losses. This paper builds on available research by exploring another constraining factor to workers outside job options: the level of industrial specialization of their occupations. This study diverges from available research in that instead of focusing on the geographical availability of jobs; it explores occupation-level characteristics as determinants of job mobility and wages. Finally, this study also relates to the literature looking at the effect of cross-industry mobility on earnings. Pindus et al. (1997) and Tohmo and Viinikainen (2017) have identified a positive correlation between wages and cross-industry mobility. This paper corroborates the findings of these studies.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 outlines the methodology I use to investigate i) the relationship between CEI and wages, ii) the mechanisms driving this relationship, and iii) possible heterogeneous effects of CEI. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 contains robustness checks. Lastly, concluding remarks follow in Section 6.",Specialists or Generalists?

The decreases are larger among international students with higher measured academic achievement. We also document academic achievement of international students and show that over 40 percent of high-scoring international SAT takers do not pursue US college education.","International students are among the largest flows of international migrants. In 2017, over 5.3 million postsecondary students studied abroad, double the number in 2003 (UNCESCO, 2020). The US has historically been the most popular destination. Through the F-1 student visa program, more than 1 million international students seek higher education in the US (IIE, 2019) and spend over 45 billion dollars each year (Chen, 2021). The F-1 visa brings more highly educated migrants to the US than any other immigration program.==== Advocates of immigration and international education stress the value of international students, such as intellectual excellence and support for the skilled labor force. However, we know little about international students’ academic credentials and how immigration policies influence their decision to attend colleges in the US.====After being admitted to a school, international students need to apply for an F-1 visa in order to legally enter the US. While the F-1 visa has no official cap, its issuance is far from certain. For examples, recent immigration policies and the COVID-19 pandemic have created massive uncertainty for obtaining student visas (Fischer, 2020). Before the pandemic, in the wake of trade tensions between the US and China, the Chinese government warned students about their prospects of receiving a visa (Redden, 2019). Fig. 1 shows that the F-1 visa refusal rate is 27 percent worldwide in 2017, with substantial variation across regions and over time.==== Because both applying to US colleges and visas are costly, changes in the expected chances of obtaining a visa may influence who iconsiders, applies, and enrolls in the US.====In this paper, we provide the first evidence on whether the US attracts high academic ability international undergraduates, and how the F-1 visa restrictiveness affects the college application process and enrollment. To address these questions, we compile a student-level dataset that contains information on demographics, SAT scores, SAT score sends, and US college enrollment for the universe of international SAT takers between 2004 and 2015—many of which do not ultimately enroll in the US. We match our data with region-year visa refusal rates to measure visa restrictiveness.====Understanding who comes to the US to study and why are of particular importance for higher education and high-skilled labor supply. First, international students usually pay full tuition, which subsidizes US institutions, especially those facing increased tuition and decreased state appropriations (e.g., Bound, Braga, Khanna, Turner, 2020, Chen). Second, the answers to our questions are central to influence skilled labor force and have broad implications for immigration policies relating to brain drain and brain gain (e.g., Docquier, Rapoport, 2012, Kerr, 2018). Even though many international students return home shortly after graduation (Chen, 2019), they have become the major supply of skilled foreign workers for US employers. In 2017, half of H-1B work visas approved for new employment were awarded to students on an F-1 visa, and most of them work in STEM jobs.==== In addition, F-1 visa holders are eligible to work after graduation through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which is cap-free and requires students to work in a field directly related to their major. The OPT issuance has well surpassed H-1B visa issuance in recent years (Amuedo-Dorantes et al., 2021). Hence, policies that affect the number or composition of international students can have more direct impacts on specific occupation/skill supply.====Our paper begins by documenting the academic ability of international students who enroll in US colleges. We show that on average, international students have stronger credentials than domestic students on multiple measures of academic ability. For example, international students score 0.64 standard deviations (SD) higher on the SAT, with 0.93 SD higher on the math section. The international-US SAT gap is driven by the fact that many top-sending regions have more academically prepared secondary students, based on the worldwide assessment, PISA, and the selection into who enrolls in US colleges is more positive among international students than US students. The SAT gap is consistent with that the graduation rate for international students is 10 percentage points (pp) higher than for domestic students.====We also show that the expansion of international enrollment in the last decade is driven by high-scoring SAT international students. The ability distribution of international students has shifted over time. In 2015, international students in the US were 20 percent more likely to have an SAT score in the top quartile than in 2004. China is the primary driving force: Over 40 percent of high-scoring international students are Chinese in 2015 versus 2 percent in 2004. The rise of Chinese students coincides with a period of decline in its student visa refusal rate.====To motivate our visa policy analysis, we show that many prospective international students who invest in the US college application process never come. Less than half of international SAT takers send test scores to US colleges, and fewer than 30 percent eventually enroll in the US.==== Furthermore, although US enrollment probability increases in SAT scores, more than half of high-scoring international SAT takers do not end up enrolling in the US.====Before international students can know whether they can enter the US on an F-1 visa, they have to pay significant psychological and monetary costs upfront to apply to US colleges and for visas. Hence an increase in expected visa restrictiveness can decrease the expected benefit of investing in the college application process, such as taking the SAT and sending test scores. We refer to this discouragement of action as the chilling effect. To assess the impact of anticipated F-1 visa restrictiveness on foreign investment in US college education, we study outcomes for SAT taking, SAT score sending, and enrollment. We measure expected visa restrictiveness with visa refusal rates faced by international students around the time of deciding whether to take the SAT and send scores.====Our identification strategy addresses two potential biases that can prevent a causal estimate of the impact of F-1 visa refusal rate on college outcomes. First, simultaneity bias may arise because the refusal rate can be driven by changes in the supply of students (e.g., less qualified visa applicants) and not the restrictiveness of the visa policy. To address this, we isolate the variation in visa restrictiveness for US entry by instrumenting the F-1 refusal rate with the visitor visa refusal rate, which is not driven by student visa applicants.====Second, both student and visitor visa refusal rates may be affected by region factors that also affect education decisions (e.g., the relation with the US). To address the potential omitted variable bias, we include region and year fixed effects to control for any region-specific factors that are time invariant (e.g., whether a US ally) and overall time trends (e.g., globalization of education). We also include a set of region-year-level controls, such as trade with the US and economic growth. Furthermore, when estimating heterogenous treatment effects, we include region-year fixed effects to capture remaining unobserved region-year factors. In practice, the instrument makes an important difference to our estimates, but the controls for omitted variables do not. Our results are robust to a set of sensitivity checks.====We find that a higher F-1 visa refusal rate discourages international students from taking the SAT and sending their scores to US colleges. On average, a 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate decreases the number of international SAT takers by 7.4 percent and the probability of sending scores to a US college by 3.7 percent, conditional on taking the SAT. Furthermore, conditional on sending scores, students send scores to slightly more selective US institutions. Our estimates show that a 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate leads to a 12.2 percent decrease in new international enrollment, with about 60 percent through the effect on SAT taking and 40 percent via the effect on score sending.====Importantly, we find that students with higher SAT scores are more responsive to the expected visa restrictiveness. A 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate decreases the median SAT score of international SAT takers by 0.04 SD and the share of takers above the 75th SAT percentile by 2 pp. The probability of sending test scores to a US college is reduced nearly double the amount for high-scoring students than for low-scoring students. Consequently, the enrollment impact on high-scoring students is larger than low-scoring students. We discuss potential explanations, such as differences in outside options and use of information, in Section 7.5.====Our paper makes direct contributions to the literature on international migration. A large number of research has studied theories and empirical evidence on the determinants of brain drain (e.g., Beine, Docquier, Rapoport, 2001, Beine, Docquier, Rapoport, 2008, Docquier, Rapoport, 2012, Kerr, 2018). Bertoli and Moraga (2013) find that the attractiveness of alternative destination (referred as “multilateral resistance”) is a key factor for migration. International education is a key channel for the brain drain of highly educated students and future workers. Kato and Sparber (2013) and Shih (2016) find that a reduction in the chance of working in the US after graduation decreases the number international students who send scores to and enroll in US colleges.====We examine how the decision on investing US education from international students responds to changes in the expected chances of obtaining a student visa.==== Our student-level data allow us to evaluate the impact of F-1 visa policy on individual score-sending decisions and enrollment outcomes. We are able to create a measure of enrollment inflow instead of stock for our region-level analysis. From a policy perspective, if the US wants to attract more international undergraduate students—either for “brain gain” or to subsidize colleges—our results suggest that easing visa restrictiveness is a path to consider.====Research on international students has been limited and traditionally focused on graduate students before the mid-2000s (e.g., Bound, Turner, Walsh, 2009, Shih, 2017). There is rising interest in international undergraduates, likely as a result of their swelling numbers and new data efforts.==== Studies find that reductions in state appropriations have led to increases in international undergraduates at public universities (Bound et al., 2020), and China’s trade liberalization is an important factor for driving Chinese student expansion in the US (Khanna et al., 2020). In addition, while international undergraduates subsidize in-state students and lead to an increase in domestic college graduates (Chen, 2021), they push domestic students from STEM majors to high-income social science majors (Anelli et al., 2023). Lastly, Chen (2019) finds that US-educated Chinese students face more labor market challenges than Chinese-educated when they return home. Due to data limitations, previous studies have only been able to provide statistics on enrollment levels and not on the composition of international students based on measures of academic ability.====Our paper differs from prior work by compiling a rich student-level dataset to answer a different line of questions. Using various measures of academic ability, we provide the first evidence that the US has attracted high-achieving international students who provide potential benefits to campuses, such as peer quality, beyond finance. In addition, unlike most of the immigration literature—which only observes migrants in the US—we also observe prospective students who have shown some interest in seeking a US education. We show that a large fraction of high-achieving SAT takers do not come, suggesting that there is some low-hanging fruit for US colleges and, perhaps, the labor market as well.====In Section 2, we discuss our data sources and compare our data with the few external data sources on international students. Section 3 presents descriptive statistics on the academic ability for international students in the US and compares them with those for US students. We also discuss why international students have higher scores and document trends in the ability distribution. Section 4 documents our outcomes of interest for the visa policy analysis, and Section 5 describes the relevant institutional backgrounds and variation in visa refusal rates. Section 6 presents our empirical strategy to estimate the impact of visa restrictiveness, and Section 7 presents the results and our discussion. Section 8 concludes.",Best and brightest?

Common metrics for reading, mathematics and science learning, as established by the ==== (PISA), are used. In order to overcome the limitations of a cross-sectional, single-cohort design, we combine multiple vintages of PISA data and exploit the fact that the testing period in these countries varied over the years. The results show that students’ yearly learning progress around the age of 15 varies from about one-tenth of a standard deviation in students’ test scores in Malaysia to about one-fourth of a standard deviation or more in Austria and Scotland.","How does the pace of learning – i.e. the gain in knowledge and skills associated with one year of schooling, or ==== – compare across countries? International assessments are designed to compare learning outcomes at a particular point in students’ school career, but they do not directly show how the learning gains made by students over comparable time intervals differ across countries. Some international assessments, such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), assess students who are in a particular grade level (typically, 4th and 8th grade); however, because of grade retention or grade skipping, in many countries students who are in the same grade level may have been exposed to different amounts of schooling. More generally, students start school with widely different knowledge and skills, meaning that differences in mean scores in these assessments cannot be readily interpreted as a measure of school productivity. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), in contrast, assesses the learning of students at age 15, regardless of the grade level attended and the amount of schooling to which students have been exposed; its mean scores cannot indicate school productivity without strong assumptions.====This article provides estimates of the yearly average learning gain in five jurisdictions that span a wide range of levels of economic development across three continents. Despite the large differences among these five school systems, the fact that results are expressed in terms of common metrics makes it possible to compare the relative effectiveness of learning systems around the age of 15 years, in three subjects (reading, mathematics and science).====The results show that students’ yearly learning progress around the age of 15 varies from about one-tenth of a standard deviation in students’ test scores in Malaysia to about one-fourth of a standard deviation or more in Austria and Scotland (United Kingdom), with the estimates for Brazil and Singapore comprised in-between these extremes. These results indicate significant differences in the productivity of schooling: in mathematics, for example, our point estimates imply that students in Austria, Scotland and Singapore learn about twice as much or more than students in Brazil and Malaysia, over a 12-month period. Such wide differences suggest that skill and human capital differences between high- and middle-income countries will continue to increase, even beyond the age of 15, not only because of differences in educational attainment (quantity of schooling), but also (and perhaps mainly) because of differences in the quality of schooling.====Results also show that in general, the average pace of learning of 15-year-olds does not differ significantly between boys and girls, or between advantaged students and disadvantaged students (defined by a median split on a variable measuring the social, economic and cultural status of students’ households). A significant difference in the yearly learning gain by subgroup is observed only in Scotland, where boys appear to make stronger progress than girls around the age of 15. This suggests that in all five countries, the wide socio-economic gaps observed at age 15, as well as the gaps in reading performance in favour of girls, largely reflect skill differences that appear at a younger age.====Several articles, in the past, have tried to identify average learning progressions from student assessment data, but only a few have done so in ways that allow to compare such progressions across countries. At first sight, the main obstacle in this endeavour is the fact that longitudinal data collections at international level are extremely rare. Only a few prior studies have embedded internationally linked assessments in longitudinal data collections (Nagy, Lüdtke, Köller, Heine, 2017, Prenzel, Baumert, Blum, Lehmann, Leutner, Neubrand, Pekrun, Rost, Schiefele, 2006, Singh, 2019). Singh (2019) highlights significant differences in productivity across developing countries, and shows that in primary grades, the effect of an extra year of schooling on test scores is substantially higher in Viet Nam than in Andra Pradesh (India), Ethiopia or Peru.==== Prenzel et al. (2006) and Nagy et al. (2017) provide estimates for 15-year-olds in Germany, based on the PISA test.====Despite its intuitive appeal, the identification of average learning gains from longitudinal data (i.e., from the aggregation of individual learning gains) faces two major challenges. A first challenge is to ensure that individual learning-gain estimates are not confounded by variations in students’ motivation or in other contingent factors that are unrelated to students’ learning. A second challenge, for the inference to a broader population of interest, is the possibility of selective attrition: due to school drop-out, absenteeism, grade repetition or for other reasons, the student population for which both baseline and follow-up test scores are available may differ in significant ways from the population of interest.====In the absence of student-level panel data, some studies have aggregated cross-sectional data into pseudo-panels at the country-by-grade level to identify average grade progressions.==== In particular, Jones et al. (2014) estimate cross-country differences in the pace of learning in primary grades for three African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) from cross-sectional differences in mean scores across grades, based on tests whose results are reported on the same scale and which were administered to representative samples of children in these three countries. Because a one-grade difference does not always correspond to a difference of one year of schooling and age (in particular, due to grade retention), grade progressions are not necessarily a direct reflection of yearly learning gains. In addition, just like average differences in student-level test scores, differences in average test scores may also be plagued by selection effects, in particular due to drop out in higher grades.====A more common approach to compare learning progressions (over time or across grade levels) in international assessment data has been the use of a regression-discontinuity estimator. We explore this approach in a companion paper (Avvisati and Givord, 2021). The typical estimator compares students born “just before” and “immediately after” the cut-off date for first-grade enrolment, in countries where the population assessed does not coincide with a single school-entry cohort. In contrast to prior studies that rely on this identification strategy (Anders, Jerrim, McCulloch, 2016, Kuzmina, Carnoy, 2016, Luyten, Peschar, Coe, 2008, Luyten, Veldkamp, 2011, Tiumeneva, Kuzmina, 2015), our companion paper suggests focusing on comparing, in PISA-participating countries, the eldest and the youngest students in terms of age (rather than in terms of school-entry age). Indeed, because at any given point in time, students’ age, their length of schooling, and their age at school entry are bound by a simple additive relationship, it is not possible to identify their distinct contribution to test scores in a cross-sectional design. While prior studies compared students of (almost) same age to focus on the joint effect of schooling and of school-entry age (sometimes claiming, for the interpretation of their results, that school-entry age effects are negligible),==== our companion paper compares students with the same school-entry age to focus on the joint effect of one year of schooling and of age; the latter corresponds to the quantity identified in the present study and in studies based on longitudinal, school-based data collections. Due to the limited sample size in survey datasets, however, cross-country comparisons of estimates based on a regression-discontinuity estimator are often imprecise.====This study proposes an original identification strategy to estimate this joint effect of age and length of schooling on learning. We use the change, across different vintages of PISA, in the time of the year when the test was conducted. In PISA, the birth dates of eligible students depend on the testing date; and when the testing date changes, the month of birth of the eldest eligible students also changes. Thus, when grouping students by month of birth, two groups can be defined such that the change in testing date has opposite effects on their age and length of schooling at the time of the test: students born in certain months are assessed at a younger age and at an earlier point in their school career than would have been the case, had the testing date remained the same; in contrast, students born in the remaining months are assessed at an older age and at a later point in their school career. The change in testing date thus acts as an exogenous source of variation which allows for the identification of the full effect of a year of schooling and of age through a difference-in-difference estimator.",The learning gain over one school year among 15-year-olds: An international comparison based on PISA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000404,13 April 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

We find a positive contemporaneous impact on self-employment, mainly driven by self-employment in non-mining industries. We also find that self-employment is pro-cyclical, meaning that self-employment increases during oil and gas booms and contracts during the bust. Finally, results suggest that self-employment explains an economically meaningful share of the employment adjustment; specifically we estimate that about 11% of the employment adjustment can be explained by self-employed workers, a group which makes up about 9% of total employment.","Entrepreneurs, in particular small business owners, are commonly viewed as the engine of economic growth and prosperity. They play a disproportionately large role in job creation and destruction, and hold a substantial portion of the U.S. wealth. For instance, Fairlie et al. (2019) find that startups create approximately 3 million jobs per year with 2.9 million of these jobs persisting five years later. Further, De Nardi et al. (2007) report that more than half of self-employed business owners fall in the top wealth quantile. Therefore, understanding the nature of entrepreneurship and identifying factors that affect it has always been of interest to governments, policymakers, and researchers.====Self-employment has been considered as the “simplest kind of entrepreneurship” (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998), and a large body of research documents that individuals’ decision to engage in entrepreneurship changes with economic conditions.==== In this paper, we contribute to this literature by investigating how localized boom and bust cycles, induced by oil and gas activity, impacted self-employment in the U.S. over the past two decades. This time period provides a unique opportunity to study self-employment dynamics, as it was dominated by plausibly exogenous fluctuations in oil and gas production from shale geological formations. These “boom towns” experienced boom and bust cycles induced by a combination of external factors including oil and natural gas prices, resource availability, and differences in the oil to gas ratio of hydrocarbons produced that naturally varies spatially within individual basins and across basins. As a growing recent literature documents, these areas experienced employment growth throughout a broad group of sectors of the economy. Although our analysis will focus on the entire U.S. (not just these shale areas), we will show that much of the fluctuation during the time frame of our analysis (2005–2019) was driven by activity in “shale boom” areas.====We utilize data on self-employment from the U.S. Census American Community Surveys (ACS), and further distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated self-employed workers, as these have been shown to have starkly different traits and income profiles (Levine and Rubinstein, 2017). We aggregate self-employment to commuting zones (CZs), which represent clusters of counties that have strong commuting ties between workers and businesses (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). To identify the causal effect of oil and gas activity on self-employment, we use detail well-level oil and natural gas production data for more than one million wells in the United States. For each county and month, we calculate the value of production from new wells (i.e., wells began production within the preceding 12 months). These monthly county values are then aggregated into yearly CZs.====Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that oil and gas activity has a positive contemporaneous impact on self-employment. Lagged effects of oil and gas activity on self-employment are negative and imply that once the boom subsides, self-employment adjusts closer to the pre-boom level. Together, this suggests that self-employment is pro-cyclical, i.e. it increases during a business cycle expansion and reduces during a business cycle contraction. Second, we estimate the sensitivity of total employment to new oil and gas production and then decompose the share of the employment adjustment that stems from self-employment. Point estimates suggest that about 11% of the employment adjustment can be explained by self-employed workers, a group which makes up about 9% of total employment. Finally, our industry-level analysis indicate that the effects on self-employment are driven primarily by individuals in non-mining industries. About two thirds of the adjustment in self-employment comes from service sectors. Notably, prior studies have found that overall employment effects from the shale boom have been concentrated in mining, construction and transportation (Feyrer, Mansur, Sacerdote, 2017, Marchand, 2012), thus this research reveals that the industry of adjustment for self-employed workers might be very different than the economy as a whole.====This paper first contributes to a large literature that examines the role of external factors affecting the choice to become entrepreneur. The literature has considered factors including access to credit (Asiedu, Freeman, Nti-Addae, 2012, Cagetti, De Nardi, 2006, Hurst, Lusardi, 2004), inheritance and gifts (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998), globalization (Dinopoulos, Unel, 2015, Eren, Onda, Unel, 2019), immigration (Fairlie, Meyer, 2003, Pekkala Kerr, Kerr, 2020), and government policies (Beland, Unel, 2019, Cullen, Gordon, 2007), among others. A few papers empirically investigated the nexus between self-employment and the economy wide business cycle (Fossen, 2020, Levine, Rubinstein, 2018).====This paper also contributes to a growing body of work that quantifies the economic effects of localized natural resource based booms.==== While this literature began before the specific shale oil and gas booms of this past decade (Allcott, Keniston, 2018, Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005), this new era of shale has created a significant resurgence in part because of the clean empirical identification afforded by the nature of the shock. Previous studies have investigated the impact of shale boom on various outcomes, and paper is more closely related to studies that have investigated the effects of resource booms on labor-market outcomes. Agerton et al. (2017); Feyrer et al. (2017); Green et al. (2019); Marchand (2012) find a positive effect of oil and gas activity on employment and wages.==== Our analysis complements and extends these studies by considering self-employed workers who are not included in establishment based labor-market data.====Our paper relates most closely to two recent studies at the intersection of oil & gas booms and entrepreneurship activity: Tsvetkova and Partridge (2017) and Bellon et al. (2021). The former examines the impact of employment growth in oil and gas industry on self-employment growth in the U.S. over the 2001–2013 period. They find that oil and gas sector expansion crowds out self-employment, which stems from a large reduction in self-employment in non-mining sectors. Our analysis differs from theirs in several aspects. Most notably, we use oil and gas production from ==== wells, which depends on preexisting geology and the recent drilling technology. We refer to “new wells” as those that began production within the preceding 12 months.==== These monthly county values are then aggregated into yearly CZs. Unlike employment growth, new production is plausibly exogenous to other shocks occurring in the region, and more appropriate for identification. Results of our analysis do not corroborate conclusions from theirs.====Using data on unexpected payments to individuals from the shale boom in Texas, Bellon et al. (2021) investigate the effect of wealth windfalls on self-employment decisions. They find that individuals who received large wealth shocks have higher self-employment rates relative to others who received smaller or no wealth shocks. Our study documents the net effect of the shale boom on entrepreneurship, and does not focus on individual decisions based on specific royalty payments. We therefore view Bellon et al. (2021) as complementary to our work.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Immigrant integration includes two distinct dimensions: cultural and ,"Immigration raises many concerns in most OECD countries and the integration of immigrants has come under scrutiny. Integration includes two distinct but complementary dimensions: the cultural assimilation and the economic integration of immigrants. According to Dustmann and Preston (2007), each of these processes heavily affects natives’ attitudes toward immigration. Over the last two decades, Germany has amended its immigration policies to encourage both the cultural assimilation and the economic integration of immigrants.==== To understand the interactions between these two processes, this paper studies the relationship between the cultural assimilation process of immigrant workers and their integration into the German labor market.====In this paper, I first study the relationship between initial cultural differences and log hourly wages of immigrants over years spent in Germany. I exploit the heterogeneity of immigrants’ origins recorded in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) to measure cultural distance from Germany at the country level. I successively consider religious, linguistic, and genetic distances, which are the main bilateral indices from the trade and migration literature. I also document the association between immigrants’ individual cultural assimilation and wage growth. I approximate the cultural assimilation of immigrants relative to natives at the individual level by measuring the distance in social concerns between each immigrant in each year and comparable natives via a set of questions repeatedly asked over years in the GSOEP.====Measuring cultural differences between individuals is particularly challenging. A widespread strategy involves comparing immigrants who have successfully assimilated to those who have not. Researchers usually rely on proxies such as interethnic marriages, the origins of the names immigrants give to their children, or comparisons of immigrants who have acquired the citizenship of their destination country with those who have not (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2020, Fouka, Mazumder, Tabellini, 2022, Gregory, Meng, 2005). Such a strategy is relevant for assessing the benefits of successful assimilation. However, it is not well suited for observing the assimilation process itself or the initial cultural differences between these immigrants. In this paper, I adopt two distinct strategies to approximate initial cultural differences and the cultural assimilation process of immigrants.====The first approach builds on bilateral indices to measure the cultural differences experienced by immigrant workers in Germany. I successively examine religious, linguistic and genetic distances between Germany and immigrants’ countries of origin, which depend on the history of religions, languages and populations across countries. According to Spolaore and Wacziarg (2016), cultural differences “include language and religion but also a broader set of norms, values and attitudes that are transmitted intergenerationally and therefore display persistence over long stretches of time”. The first index is based on the family tree of religions (Fearon and Laitin, 2003), which reflects their successive divisions throughout history. Within this tree, religions are first grouped into broad categories and then broken down into more precise classifications. The religious distance index constructed by Spolaore and Wacziarg (2016) depends on the number of ramifications shared by each pair of religions. Linguistic and genetic distances follow the same logic (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2016). All three indices measure cultural differences at the country-pair level. They depend on the relative representation of religions, languages and genes in each country.====The second approach approximates immigrants’ cultural assimilation in stated preferences at the individual level. Cultural assimilation refers to the process through which immigrants progressively converge toward native behaviors, values, beliefs, and concerns. I follow Jaschke et al. (2021) and select all questions on social concerns asked in each year in the GSOEP. For each question for each year, I compute the distance between the answer given by each immigrant and the average answer given by natives belonging to the same age group and living in the same region. I then aggregate the results from each question using an index of Euclidean distance. In this paper, I use this index measured at the individual level over years to document the cultural assimilation process and its relationship to wage growth.====Using bilateral indices, I document that immigrants from countries with a cultural distance that is one standard deviation larger earn, on average, 4% to 10% less per hour when they enter the German labor market. These wage differences between immigrants diminish over years spent in Germany. I show that the wage gap associated with a one standard deviation difference in religious and genetic distance disappears after 15 to 20 years. Using the individual index of distance in social concerns, I investigate the role of cultural assimilation in this dynamic pattern. I provide evidence that immigrants who experience a greater increase in cultural assimilation experience more wage growth as well. This paper adopts a descriptive approach and does not make a causal claim. Nevertheless, this series of results shows that the cultural assimilation process is associated with the labor market integration of immigrants.====This paper contributes to the literature on the economic assimilation of immigrants. Since the seminal work of Chiswick (1978), this stream of research focused on determining whether wage assimilation patterns have resulted from immigrants’ economic integration or from selection mechanisms (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2014, Borjas, 1985, Dustmann, Görlach, 2016, Lubotsky, 2007) changing the composition of immigrant populations. My results bring additional evidence from the German context to this debate. They show that the cultural and social assimilation of immigrant workers also helps explain wage assimilation patterns.====This paper also relates to the literature measuring the cultural assimilation of immigrants. Abramitzky et al. (2020) and Fouka et al. (2022) rely on several proxies including the names immigrants give to their children, naturalization and interethnic marriage to document immigrants’ efforts and success in assimilation. Bertrand and Kamenic (2018) and Desmet and Wacziarg (2021) use survey responses on values, concerns and habits to measure cultural convergence over time across different groups of individuals. Similarly, Jaschke et al. (2021) compare survey responses between natives and refugees to measure the cultural assimilation of the latter in stated preferences. In this paper, I use this methodology to approximate the cultural assimilation of immigrants in Germany.====Finally, this paper relates to the part of this literature specifically focusing on the relationship between cultural and labor market integration. One approach consists of comparing the labor market outcomes of immigrants who have successfully assimilated to those of others (Costanza, Corrado, Zahra, 2017, Gregory, Meng, 2005). Another approach compares labor market outcomes of immigrants who differ by their attachment to their original culture. Battu and Zenou (2010); Bisin et al. (2011); Casey and Dustmann (2010); Mason (2004), and Islam and Raschky (2015) show that immigrants reporting a stronger ethnic identity have poorer employment prospects. Other studies document how outward signs of cultural assimilation affect labor market outcomes. Bleakley and Chin (2004); Chiswick and Miller (2012); Dustmann and Fabbri (2003); Dustmann and Soest (2002); Guven and Islam (2015); McManus et al. (1983) and Lochmann et al. (2018) report consistent evidence indicating a negative effect of language deficiency on employment and wages. A last approach specifically focuses on the relationship between naturalization and labor market outcomes. Bratsberg et al. (2002); Felfe et al. (2020); Gathmann and Keller (2018); Gathmann and Monscheuer (2020), and Govind (2021) document several channels through which naturalization benefits the economic integration of immigrant workers.====My paper contributes to several aspects of this literature. First, it documents the relationship between wages and the cultural assimilation process itself. Most papers focus on either the labor market implications of successful assimilation or ethnic identity. My paper provides evidence showing that the process itself is associated with higher wages. This dimension is particularly relevant from a policy perspective. Finally, this work also complements the assimilation literature by showing that the different measures of cultural differences are complementary and give results that are consistent with each other.====Section 2 of this paper presents the data used. Section 3 studies the relationship between initial cultural differences and differences in wage levels across immigrants by the number of years spent in Germany. Section 4 focuses on the relationship between cultural assimilation and wage growth.

We test whether this result holds also for natives and immigrants in Europe – groups whose interaction is plausibly more constrained by religious and cultural differences. Specifically, we study whether exposure to immigrant origin peers in school affects natives’ probability to have a child with a partner with non-Western background. Identification is based on variation in immigrant exposure across cohorts within schools in Sweden. We find that natives are affected by exposure to opposite-sex peers: native girls (boys) are more likely to have a child with a partner with non-Western background when exposed to immigrant origin boys (girls). In contrast to previous studies, we find no effects from same-sex peer exposure.","Recent migration flows from non-Western countries to Europe have intensified the discussion around effective integration policy (2016; OECD 2016). Most of the relevant academic literature focuses on the effects of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives, the economic integration of immigrants (see e.g. Dustmann et al. 2017 and Peri 2016 for overviews), and opportunities and school outcomes of native and immigrant children (Gould et al., 2004, 2009; Geay et al., 2013; Figlio and Özek, 2019). In the long run, however, the development of countries with large immigrant minorities will also depend on natives’ attitudes, preferences and behavior towards minorities.====In this paper, we ask whether childhood exposure to ethnic minority peers in school affects natives’ future interaction with minority group members. Future contacts with the minority group could be affected through a change of attitudes (Allport, 1954), or simply because childhood exposure might imply more meeting opportunities or deteriorating economic opportunities of natives.====We focus on long-run outcomes that are observed in register data and capture revealed preferences for interacting with the minority group. Our main outcome of interest is an indicator variable equal to one if a native-born individual in the future has a child with a person of non-Western origin, which we view as a proxy for inter-ethnic family formation. As suggested by Kalmijn (1998) and Fryer (2007), integration in the most intimate spheres of life, such as cohabitation and marriage, truly reflects the majority's attitudes towards minorities, and shows that members of different groups accept each other as social equals.====We also study how childhood exposure to individuals with immigrant background affects future neighborhood and workplace composition as well as the ethnic composition of the schools to which parents send their children. That is, does the experience of immigrant peers in school affect parents’ revealed preferences for their own children's interactions with immigrants at school? In addition to capturing revealed preferences for interacting with minority group members, these outcomes constitute broad measures of the joint integration of immigrants and natives in a society, which reflect inter-group contact opportunities and social and economic integration.====We find that exposure to minority peers in school increases natives’ probability of having a child with a partner with non-Western background. Exposure to minority peers can affect future inter-ethnic contact through changed attitudes towards immigrants, but there are also other possible channels. In this study, we address two alternative mechanisms: First, a mechanical relationship due to an increase in meeting opportunities (the “opportunities” mechanism). Second, effects on human capital related outcomes, which in turn may impact both the treated individual's attractiveness in the marriage market, and the future peer group and meeting opportunities throughout the education system and working life.====In addition to the overall effect of being exposed to immigrant peers, we follow Merlino et al. (2019) and rely on the theoretical assumption that social contacts among young students mostly occur within gender, i.e., girls (boys) interact more with other girls (boys) than with boys (girls).==== In accordance with this assumption, same-gender interaction may be more conducive to attitude changes than opposite-gender exposure. Our specification follows this theoretical reasoning and allows for different effects from exposure to same- vs. opposite sex minority peers.====The setting is Sweden, a country where 19% of the population is foreign-born. This group is predominantly made up of refugees and family members of refugees, today originating primarily from the middle-East (Iran, Iraq and Syria) (2019). The study population is native-born students exposed to idiosyncratic variation in school-cohort peers with non-Western origin in grade 9. Because of the strict enforcement of residence-based school assignment in Sweden in the early 1990s, we can use within-school variation across cohorts without being concerned that natives respond to immigrant inflows by changing schools (c.f. Dustmann and Preston 2001). We rely exclusively on register data which allows us to study observed behavior, and therefore circumvent the problem of misreporting bias in survey-based studies on attitudes.====Our results are in line with evidence from the U.S. by Merlino et al. (2019) and Shen (2018) and show that peer influences affect inter-group family formation also in a European context where we study relationships between natives and immigrants with non-Western origin. This finding is important, since inter-ethnic relations in Europe often cross religious barriers, and mating patterns for some immigrant groups are influenced by “third party interference” by e.g. family members in the selection process (Kalmijn, 1994; 1998).==== However, our estimated effect is much smaller than that of exposure to black peers on future interracial romantic relationships found in the US (Merlino et al., 2019), and our results suggest a more complex explanation for the main effect: First, we do not find that same-gender interaction matters most: in our context it is instead opposite-gender interaction that drives the effect. Second, it seems like exposure to non-Western peers affects educational choices, which may in turn affect the probability of ending up in a mixed-ethnic relationship. Taken together, we cannot exclude that attitudes have changed due to exposure to immigrant peers during school, but our results also suggest alternative and partly complementary explanations.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In this paper, we present evidence highlighting a new possible determinant of this unbalance in the labor force: endogamy intensity. We define endogamy as “marriage within the community”, and we argue that it helps preserve and reinforce social norms stigmatizing working women, along with reducing the probability of divorce, which in turn disincentivizes women's participation in the labor force. We proxy the endogamy rate of a ==== by the degree of concentration of its surnames’ distribution, and we provide evidence that a more intense custom of endogamy contributed to enlarging gender participation gaps across Italian municipalities in 2001. In order to deal with endogeneity issues, we make use of an instrumental variable strategy, by instrumenting the endogamy measure of a municipality by the degree of ruggedness of its territory: the asperity of a municipality's surface indeed contributes to its geographical isolation, thus incentivizing in- marriage. In our main 2SLS result, a standard deviation increase in our proxy of endogamy is linked to roughly a 0.3 standard deviation increase in the gender participation gap of 2001. In addition, we provide evidence supporting our main hypothesis, documenting how higher rates of in-marriage are linked to the preservation of social norms and to greater marriage stability, with a lower probability of divorce.","When compared to other EU countries, Italy is still lagging in the integration of women into the labor market. According to Istat, the gender participation gap, defined as the difference between ratios of men and women of working age that participate in the labor force, was 18,2% in 2020, the second highest value in the European Union (after Malta). This gap has been declining in the last decades, with a decrease of 16,6% since 1971 (always according to Istat data), but it still remains a complicated and yet unsolved issue characterizing this country. The factors that led the peninsula to this situation of deep gender inequality are complex and multifaceted, from discouraging characteristics of the labor demand (such as the gender wage gap) to cultural reasons involving strict and long-standing social norms. We focus here on explaining Italian contemporaneous rates of the gender participation gap by looking at a new possible determinant: endogamy rates. We define endogamy as “marriage within the community”, so a marriage between two individuals that belong to the same so- cial group, live in the same location, and share the same traditions and customs. We argue that endogamy generates two mechanisms limiting a community's female labor supply. From a first perspective, endogamy increases communities’ social isolation, which helps preserve and reinforce traditional social norms and a more conservative role of the woman inside the household. In addition, endogamous unions are characterized by higher costs of dissolution with respect to exogamous ones, given the stronger social ties of the former communities. As a consequence, the probability of divorce is lower and this decreases incentives for wives to look for jobs, given the reduced need to have an “outside option” providing economic stability in case the marriage ends====. Keeping in mind these two mechanisms, our prediction is that if a custom of in-marriage is persistent in an Italian municipality (which is identified as a community in our analysis), it will exhibit lower contemporaneous levels of female labor force participation and larger gender participation gaps with respect to more “exogamous” municipalities. When we focus on how to technically evaluate this prediction, we encounter two identification issues: first, how to measure the intensity of endogamous marriages within a community, and second, to what extent we are able to detect a causal effect of endogamy on the gender participation gap. We decide to measure the past intensity of endogamy within a community through the diversity of its residents’ surnames, exploiting the indexes by Buonanno and Vanin (2017). To address endogeneity concerns, namely omitted variable bias and reverse causality, we make use of an instrumental variable strategy: municipalities’ intensity of in-marriage is instrumented by the degree of ruggedness of its territory. Here, the underlying logic is that the geographic fragmentation of a municipality's surface contributes to its isolation and augments the frequency of in-marriage, as it is confirmed by our first- stage regressions. The main concern of using this instrument is the validity of the exclusion restriction, since it has been demonstrated that ruggedness has direct and negative effects on economic activity (Nunn and Puga, 2012) and it could therefore generate a scarcity of jobs. To support the validity of our instrumental variable strategy, we extensively discuss the inclusion of controls in our specification preventing ruggedness from directly impacting our outcome of interest. In addition, in the online Appendix D we present a placebo analysis supporting the validity of the exclusion restriction assumption. However, even after control- ling for observables and performing this placebo, ruggedness could still be suspected to be an imperfect instrument: this is why in the online Appendix E we show that the effect of endogamy on the gender participation gap is robust even if we relax the exclusion restriction assumption, following the approach suggested by Nevo and Rosen (2012)====.====Our main results show how the past intensity of endogamy within a community contributes to enlarging gender participation gaps across Italian municipalities in 2001. These results, confirmed by a series of robustness checks, shed light on a new perspective linking marriage patterns and female labor supply, providing a new explanation for the gender-unbalanced Italian labor force.====The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we discuss the related literature, with the contribution given by our work. In Section 3 we illustrate the problematic integration of women into the Italian labor force and explain how endogamy could have contributed to generating the current large gender participation gap in the peninsula.

Section 5 focuses on the main empirical results with the link between en- dogamy and the gender participation gap, and Section 6 discusses the channels that could have generated these results.

Results indicate that state implementation of a “modern” Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is associated with decreases in opioid sales of between 5% and 20% and that pill mill laws are associated with a decrease in opioid sales of between 15% and 40%. While these policies were associated with reductions in prescription opioid sales they were not significantly associated with drug- and opioid-related mortality, although estimates consistently indicated that these policies reduced mortality. In the case of socioeconomic outcomes, we found consistent evidence that the adoption of a “modern” PDMP was associated with small, but statistically significant reductions in employment of 1% to 2%; small reductions in earnings that were not statistically significant for full sample, but were significant and larger for a low-educated sample; and similarly small, marginally significant increases in receipt of public assistance, particularly for women; and a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married among females. In contrast, pill mill laws were associated with marginally significant increases in employment of 1% to 2%, but only among those ages 18 to 25; small, but insignificant increases in earnings of males of between 2% to 4%; and a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married.","The opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues for local, state and federal policymakers and its consequences have been widely documented. The epidemic is often characterized by the rise of prescription opioid use. Between 1992 and 2011, the number of opioid prescriptions in the U.S. increased nearly three-fold from approximately 75 million annually to 220 million annually (Manchikanti et al., 2017). At its peak in 2010–2012, the Opioid prescription rate was 80 per 100 persons in the U.S., although only about 20% of the population had one or more prescriptions (CDC 2018b). Since 2010, the opioid prescription rate has continued to decline, and in 2020, the dispensing rate had fallen to the lowest in the 15 years, to 43.3 per 100 persons in 2020 (CDC 2021). The second prominent fact used to characterize the opioid epidemic is the rise in prescription opioid-related mortality. Between 1999 and 2019, the rate of prescription opioid overdose deaths increased from just over 1 per 100,000 to just over 15 per 100,000 in 2019 (NCDAS, 2020). Finally, the rise in non-prescription opioid (e.g., heroin and fentanyl) deaths are also often included to document the epidemic. The rate of non-prescription opioid (heroin and fentanyl combined) deaths increased from approximately 1 per 100,000 in 1999 to 2 per 100,000 in 2010. After this date, non-prescription opioid deaths began to increase markedly rising to 15.8 per 100,000 by 2019 (NCDAS 2022).====While the sheer magnitude of opioid prescriptions and the mortality consequences of the opioid epidemic have garnered most of the research and public policy attention, the rise in prescription opioid use may have had other serious consequences. For example, outcomes that may be plausibly affected by opioid use, both medical and non-medical use, include marriage, earnings, and receipt of social welfare benefits (Duenas et al., 2016; Gustavsson et al., 2012; Turk et al., 2016). There have been relatively few studies of the effects of prescription opioids on these outcomes. There are several studies of opioids and employment, but several were observational and did not use a credible research design (Aliprantis et al., 2019; Currie et al., 2019; Krueger, 2017; Harris et al. 2019). Results from these observational studies are mixed. In terms of quasi-experimental studies, Beheshti (2022) examined the effect of Hydrocodone's reclassification into a schedule II drug (a higher risk category) on employment. Beheshti 2022 has a setup that is unique in that Hydrocodone received a higher schedule and in the same year Tramadol another popular opioid is demoted into a lower schedule drug. The author finds that these changes increased employment. However, recently (Gupta, 2020 showed that Tramadol increases almost entirely substituted for the decreases in Hydrocodone “leading to no statistically detectable short-run reduction in total opioid prescriptions”. There are also studies that examined the effects of Oxycontin reformulation on earnings (Powell, 2020) and on disability claims (Park and Powell, 2021). In these studies, the emphasis is on substitution to illicit markets once Oxycontin was reformulated in 2010.====In this study, we examine the effect of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) and pill mill statutes on employment and earnings, and explore heterogeneity by age that is correlated with misuse vs medical use of opioids. We also examine two other outcomes: marriage, and receipt of social welfare benefits (Duenas et al., 2016; Gustavsson et al., 2012; Turk et al., 2016). There have been no studies of the effect of prescription opioid use on these outcomes other outcomes.==== We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in PDMPs and “pill mill” statutes.====While there are a variety of types of PDMPs that vary with respect to features, we focus on PDMPs that have been characterized as “modern”. Unlike earlier electronic PDMPs that require data to be sent infrequently, such as monthly, and use magnetic tapes or computer disks to transfer records, modern PDMPs can be readily accessed by any authorized user (e.g.: physician or pharmacist). Our classification differs from some prior research focused on mandated PDMP – those where physician or pharmacist is required to consult the PDMP before prescribing or dispensing an opioid. We show (see Appendix Table 2) that all mandated PDMPs are modern, but that its mainly the modern aspect of the PDMP that accounts for reductions in opioid quantities The other policy we study, Pill Mill laws, which target prescribers who account for a disproportionate share of opioid prescribing. Pill Mill laws include legal provisions establishing state inspection authority or specific training requirements for Pill Mill owners or associated physician.====Results of our analysis of the effect of modern PDMPs and pill mill laws on opioid prescriptions indicate that the adoption of a “modern” PDMPs decreased all opioid prescription sales by between 5% to 10% and decreased sales of hydrocodone and oxycodone (the top two prescriptions) by between 7% and 20%. Pill mill statutes had even larger effects; decreasing all opioid prescription sales by between 14% and 28% and decreased hydrocodone and oxycodone prescriptions by 20% to 48%. This evidence is consistent with several prior studies.==== The variation in prescription opioid sales, and presumably opioid use, caused by the state policies provides exogenous variation in prescription opioid use that we use to assess the effects of prescription opioid use on socioeconomic outcomes. We also estimate the effect of these states policies on mortality.====An important conceptual and empirical contribution of our analysis is the stratification of the sample by age and gender. This stratification is motivated by evidence suggesting that most prescription opioid use is medical and that rates of non-medical use, and the ratio of non-medical to medical use of prescription opioids differs significantly by age, gender and to a lesser extent education (see Table 1). For example, approximately 15% of females ages 35 to 64 reported that they had a prescription opioid in 2002–2006, but only 3% reported non-medical use.==== These figures suggest that this group of females has a relatively high rate of prescription opioid use that is mostly medically prescribed. There is relatively little purposeful misuse of prescription opioids, or use of illegal opioids, among this demographic group, and women in this age group have relatively little use of other illegal drugs (5%) excluding marijuana. In contrast, among men ages 18 to 34, only 7% reported having a medical prescription for opioids in 2002–2006, but 10% also reported non-medical use. For this group, much of prescription opioid use is misuse and this group has a relatively high rate of illegal drug use (17%) excluding marijuana. Given these differences in opioid use, it is plausible that changes in prescription opioid use due to state policies had different effects on mortality and socioeconomic outcomes of these demographic groups. For groups with high rates of misuse, curtailing prescription opioid use may be health improving whereas for groups with mainly appropriate medical use of prescription opioids, limiting such use may have adverse health effects. We develop this point in more detail below.====As already noted, results of our analysis indicate that state implementation of a “modern” PDMP is associated with decreases in opioid sales of between 5% and 20% and that pill mill laws are associated with a decrease in opioid sales of between 15% and 50%. The reductions in prescription opioid sales associated with these state policies were, in general, not associated with statistically significant effects on mortality, although the adoption of a “modern” PDMP had a consistently negative association with drug- and opioid-related mortality and the effect sizes for opioid-related mortality were approximately 8%. These figures suggest a relatively large elasticity of opioid-related mortality with respect to prescription opioid use. Pill mill statutes were also associated with a consistent, negative decrease in opioid-related mortality, but magnitudes of estimates varied across demographic groups and were relatively imprecise. We found consistent evidence that, across all demographic groups, the adoption of a “modern” PDMP was associated with small, but statistically significant reductions in employment of 1% to 2%; reductions in earnings that were not statistically significant and similarly small; marginally significant increases in receipt of public assistance, particularly for women; and a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married among females. In contrast, pill mill laws were, in most cases, positively associated with employment and earnings, but effect sizes were small and, in most cases, not statistically significant. Pill mill laws were associated with a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married among all demographic groups.====Overall, while state policies were associated with a substantial reduction in prescription opioid sales (and presumably use), the impact of this decline and these policies on mortality and socioeconomic outcomes has been quite modest at the population level. This is an important finding and policy relevant. However, population level estimates suggest that effects at the individual level may have been substantial because only a portion of the population was likely affected by the policy. For example, estimates indicate that adoption of a “modern” PDMP was associated with a 1% to 2% reduction in employment. If we assume that 20% of sample used opioids and that adoption of a “modern” PDMP decreased that use by 10%, then it suggests that for every person who was deterred from using prescription opioids—2% of population–there was a large decrease in employment of 1% to 2%. These are crude calculations of the effect of treatment (“modern” PDMP) on treated (opioid users) and should be viewed cautiously, but they illustrate that small reduced form effects may mask large treatment-on-treated effects. We discuss these issues again in our conclusion.","Effects of prescription opioids on employment, earnings, marriage, disability and mortality: Evidence from state opioid control policies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000337,15 March 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

The effects on the educational composition of the labor force depend crucially on the structure of the labor market. An increase of skilled public-sector wages has a small positive impact on educational composition and larger negative impact on the private employment of skilled workers, if the two sectors are segmented. If there are movements across the two sectors, it has large positive impacts on education and on skilled private employment. We highlight the usefulness of the model for policymakers by calculating the value of public-sector job security for skilled and unskilled workers.","The government is a major employer of qualified workers, hiring more than 25 per cent of all college graduates in most OECD economies. However, in the public sector, the returns of education are lower. On average, the public sector pays higher wages than the private sector but the premium is higher for workers without a college degree.==== Our objective is to study how public-sector employment and wage policies, heterogeneous across education groups, influence incentives to invest in formal education and employment of workers with and without college.====We set up a search model with a private and a public sector. Employment and wages in the private sector are determined through the usual channels of free entry and Nash bargaining. In the public sector, by contrast, employment and wages are policy variables and, hence, taken as exogenous. We incorporate an education decision. Prior to entering the labor market, individuals decide whether to invest in education. Doing so is costly but yields returns, as highly-educated workers benefit from higher job-finding rates and wages in both sectors. Workers are heterogeneous with respect to their education costs. Thus, only a fraction of individuals – those whose benefits exceed the costs – invest in education.====We find that wage and employment policies affect the educational composition and unemployment rate of skilled and unskilled workers. The mechanisms and the quantitative effects depend on the labour market structure - segmented markets or random search. Under segmented markets, workers choose a career in a particular sector and might face an entry cost for public-sector jobs. Under random search, unemployed workers apply randomly to jobs in both sectors, and do not face an entry cost in the public sector. We argue that the two sectors are segmented when barriers to entering the public sector exist. These barriers may represent national entry exams or jobs that are restricted to workers with political capital. We think this assumption portrays a realistic mechanism of selection into the public sector in several countries, documented empirically by Nickell and Quintini (2002) or experimentally by Bó et al. (2013) lying at the heart of current policy discussions. High wages attract many unemployed to queue for public-sector jobs. Conversely, if wages are too low, few unemployed search in the public sector, which then faces recruitment problems. In several countries, like France or Spain, the general rule is that civil servants are recruited through competitive exams early in their careers which clearly suggests that markets are segmented. However, we also examine the scenario where workers search randomly for jobs in both sectors. This could be a realistic assumption for some types of public-sector jobs or for some countries, where there are no barriers to entering the public sector. In the US, for instance, the majority of federal government jobs are filled through an examination of the applicant’s background, work experience, and education, not through a written civil service test. While this in itself does not rule out that markets are segmented, it is consistent with unemployed workers not specifically searching for a public-sector job, but getting one by chance.====If the two sectors are segmented, an increase of skilled public-sector wages has a small positive impact on the proportion of highly educated and a larger negative impact on skilled private employment. If search across the two sectors is random, it has a large positive impact on both education and skilled private employment. In segmented markets, when skilled public-sector wages increase, more people queue for these jobs. The consequent decrease in the job-finding rate partially offsets the extra gains of education. However, if workers search randomly for jobs in both sectors such offsetting decrease in job-finding rate is not possible. The value of education goes up by more, leading to larger increases in the proportion of high-educated in the labor force. As unemployed search randomly for jobs, a higher pool of educated workers leads to a higher level of skilled private employment, but a lower level of unskilled private employment. Quantitatively, in the model calibrated to four economies - United States, United Kingdom, France and Spain - a 10 per cent increase in skilled wages raises the number of educated workers by 0 to 0.18 per cent under segmented markets, and by 2.5 to 6.9 per cent under random search. Our results are consistent with a recent empirical paper by Somani (2021) that exploits a public-university expansion in Ethiopia together with a shift of demand of public organizations from workers without college to workers with a college degree. Education attainment increased after the expansion, but only in districts where the public-wage premium is large. We also consider a third labour market structure with segmented markets, but in which a worker can choose the sector to apply to whenever in unemployment. This structure allows movements of workers between sectors and shares features of both the segmented markets and random search models.====In policy discussions over public-sector pay, it is frequently argued that the jobs offer compensating benefits, like job-security. We highlight the usefulness of our model by quantifying the value of job security in the public-sector, for workers with and without college. We calculate what fraction of their wage would private-sector workers sacrifice for the job-separation rate of the public sector, or conversely, how much would public-sector workers have to be compensated in order to have the job-security of the private sector. As our model is populated by risk-neutral workers, this is a lower bound for the value of job security. We find that these premia vary across countries and across workers. It is larger in countries where unemployment is more persistent and the unemployment benefits are low, and it is larger for unskilled workers. The job-security premium in the US varies between 0.5 to 1.1 per cent for skilled workers and between 1.5 to 5.9 per cent for unskilled workers. In Spain, the values range from 2.3 to 7.8 per cent.====We contribute to the recent literature that analyzes the role and effects of public employment and wages. Some papers assume that the two sectors’ labor markets are segmented, and that the unemployed choose which of the sectors to search in, depending on the government’s hiring, separation and wage policies. Hörner et al. (2007) study the effect of turbulence on unemployment when wages in the public sector are insulated from this volatility. Quadrini and Trigari (2007) show how different exogenous business cycle rules affect unemployment volatility. Gomes (2015) emphasizes the role of public-sector wages in achieving the efficient allocation, while Afonso and Gomes (2014) highlight the interactions between private and public wages. Chassamboulli and Gomes (2021) study the role of nepotism in public sector hiring. In a model with workers heterogeneous in ability, Geromichalos and Kospentaris (2022) study how workers’ selection into the public sector affects macroeconomic aggregates.====Other papers assume that the unemployed search randomly across sectors, and, hence, policies affect the equilibrium through the outside option of the unemployed and their reservation wage. Burdett (2012) includes the public sector in a job-ladder framework where firms post wages. Bradley et al. (2017) further introduce job-to-job transitions between the two sectors to study the effects of public-sector policies on the distribution of private-sector wages. Albrecht et al. (2017) consider heterogeneous human capital and match specific productivity in a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model. Michaillat (2014) shows that the crowding-out effect of public employment is lower during recessions, giving rise to higher government spending multipliers. These papers’ objective is to determine how public employment and wage policies affect private employment, the unemployment rate and private wages. Feng and Guo (2021) focus on employment of state-owned enterprizes in China. Because there is no clear reason why one assumption is more relevant and their relevance might vary across countries, we compare the results under the two structures.====With the exception of Albrecht et al. (2017), none of these papers consider heterogeneity in education, an oversight, given that the government predominantly hires workers with college degree and that the premia it pays vary with education. Two papers consider this dimension of heterogeneity in a search and matching model. Gomes (2018) examines the effects of a public-sector reform that eliminates the wage premium for all workers. Navarro and Tejada (2022) study the interaction between public employment and the minimum wage. Other papers model this heterogeneity in a frictionless labour market. Domeij and Ljungqvist, 2019 study how the public-sector hiring of skilled and unskilled workers in Sweden and the US can explain the diverging evolutions of the skill premium in the two countries. Garibaldi et al. (2021) document that underemployment is more salient in the public sector in OECD countries and disentangle whether the higher education intensity in the public sector is due to technology, wage compression or a higher level of underemployment. In a model of occupational choice, Gomes and Kuehn (2017) analyze the effects of skill-biased hiring in the public sector on the occupational choice of entrepreneurs and on firm size. Wilson (1982) studies public-sector employment within a neoclassical optimal taxation model. With the exception of Wilson (1982) and Navarro and Tejada (2022) who formalize the education decision but do not analyse it in detail, all other papers take the education endowment as exogenous. By endogenizing the choice of education and showing under which conditions and how government employment and wage policies affect it, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of education that started with the seminal contributions of Mincer (1958), Ben-Porath (1967), Weisbrod (1962) and Becker (1975).

Birthright citizenship, which is much less common in Europe, turns out to be a powerful tool for getting second-generation immigrants off to a good start. Together, citizenship acts as a powerful catalyst benefiting immigrants as well as host countries.","Migration flows and the share of the foreign-born population have increased substantially in recent decades – both in the traditional immigration countries like Australia, Canada, or the United States but also in other advanced economies. As a result, many host countries in Europe now have a sizable foreign-born population: the share is 16.1% in Germany, 14% in the United Kingdom and 12.4% in France – comparable to the 13.6% in the United States (OECD, 2022). This trend is likely to continue in the face of demographic ageing and scarce labor in host countries coupled with population growth and adverse conditions in some origin countries.====The increasing diversity of the population has brought the question of immigrant integration to the top of the political agenda. Without integration, whether economically, politically or socially, the immigrant population may remain marginalized and unable to take advantage of the opportunities in the host country. For the host country, failure to integrate immigrants imposes severe challenges ranging from fiscal costs to ghettoization and even social tensions if immigrants are not well integrated or perceived by the native population as a threat to jobs, housing or the local culture, for instance.====Integration is clearly a complex phenomenon that is not easily captured with a single measure (e.g., Hainmueller et al., 2015). Most scholars distinguish between economic, social, or political integration. Economic integration includes integration in the labor market, but also in the housing market, education or training. Social integration may include the intensity of interaction with natives, engagement in local clubs and organizations, but also covers long-run decisions like partner choice, marriage behavior, and fertility. Political integration captures interest and actual participation in political processes and organizations as well as voting behavior etc. In addition, some scholars conceptualize integration in terms of identity, language, and norms or values, which captures how much immigrants feel as part of the culture and customs of the host country. The dimension may be labeled as cultural integration (Algan et al., 2010) or linguistic and psychological integration (Hainmueller et al., 2015). Clearly, integration along these various dimensions depends on immigrants’ preferences and choices; but we argue that they depend just as much on the opportunities the host country offers to support and encourage integration.====Such opportunities are shaped in part by policies to facilitate immigrant integration. Among those, the option to become a citizen of the host country plays a prominent role. Citizenship is the most important privilege a host country can bestow on its immigrant population. Becoming a citizen and hence, a full member of the host society has obvious benefits in terms of political rights and standing for high political offices. But do these benefits also reach beyond the political realm? Some think that the importance of citizenship for integration has declined as the rights of other titles like permanent residency have expanded over time.==== In many countries, permanent residents have security of residence and some protection against expulsion: they also enjoy many of the same benefits and access to public transfers as citizens, for instance. And yet, it is only citizens that enjoy the full protection and support by the host state; and citizenship facilitates sponsoring and securing citizenship for family members.====If one accepts the idea that citizenship matters even today, the question arises how to design citizenship policies: who has access, when and which criteria have to be fulfilled? The design of citizenship policies is often shaped by two opposing views on the role of citizenship. The first one, popular in the political and public debate, argues that citizenship is the crown for a successfully completed integration process. Viewed from this perspective, the requirements for naturalization should be strict, such as long residency requirements, mandatory language or civic knowledge tests, in order to reward integration efforts and select the immigrants most willing to invest in integration. Once immigrants are awarded citizenship, they have reached the end point of their integration process.====A very different perspective argues that citizenship acts as a catalyst for immigrant integration. In this perspective, obtaining host-country citizenship promotes the subsequent integration of immigrants, because it inspires them to invest in a future in the host country, changes the role models they aspire to or because it reduces discrimination by natives, for instance. If citizenship is a catalyst, very long residency requirements delay integration and possibly deter subsequent investments as would stringent language or civic knowledge tests.====Yet, research on whether, how and for whom citizenship matters, and which citizenship policies work, comes with specific methodological challenges. Immigrant-native achievement gaps in school or the labor market are typically lower for traditional immigration countries with liberal citizenship rules like Canada or Australia than for countries with more restrictive citizenship policies like Germany or Switzerland (Sweetman and Van Ours, 2014). While this comparison is suggestive, there are many other differences across countries with more liberal and more restrictive policies that could explain the differential outcomes for immigrants. These other cross-country differences are likely to influence the immigrant selection, the environment immigrants find themselves in, and hence, the choices families with a migratory background make. Access to citizenship sometimes varies within a country: children with one native and one foreign-born parent obtain citizenship automatically, for example. Yet, selection into mixed marriages is likely to create a different family environment than in families with two foreign-born parents (Meng and Gregory, 2005). Moreover, not all immigrants have an interest or see any net benefit in obtaining the passport of the host country. Hence, the integrative power of citizenship further depends on who decides to take up the opportunity and how that decision is shaped by eligibility rules.====The early literature on citizenship relied on cross-sectional data comparing naturalized citizens with other immigrants who were either not eligible or did not apply for naturalization (e.g. Chiswick, 1978, DeVoretz, Pivnenko, 2005 for North America; Bevelander and Veenman, 2008 for the Netherlands; Bevelander, Pendakur, 2011, Scott, 2008 for Sweden; and Fougère and Safi, 2009 for France). More recently, studies have employed panel data to study the relationship between naturalization and subsequent labor market performance using individual fixed effects to control for selection effects (Bratsberg, Ragan, Nasir, 2002, Bratsberg, Raaum, 2011, Steinhardt, 2012). While insightful, this literature faces some limitations. The variation comes from the migrant’s decision to naturalize and the estimation relies on observable controls and possibly fixed effects to address the selection into naturalization. It is unclear whether panel approaches are enough to eliminate any selection bias. Moreover, rational expectations would imply that some decisions like investments in human capital or the selection of a spouse might be undertaken even before the person actually naturalizes. In addition, the literature does not provide answers to several important questions: who actually benefits from more liberal access to citizenship? And which citizenship policies work? The literature has largely focused on labor market integration, while the discussion above showed that integration is multidimensional and goes well beyond the labor market.====Recent research has made substantial progress in illuminating the effects of citizenship by leveraging large-scale reforms in several European countries. Such reforms offer a unique opportunity to deepen our insights about how citizenship works, for whom it works and which rules matter. There is much to learn from these quasi-experiments and field experiments about the integration process, the take-up decisions of immigrants and the eligibility rules that matter. This paper surveys the main insights the recent literature exploiting citizenship reforms and experimental variation has generated for immigrant integration.",Citizenship and integration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000180,4 March 2023,2023,Research Article,19.0

The theoretical framework of this paper predicts that a pronounced origin country identity of immigrants may reduce investments in country-specific human capital—with negative consequences for the school and labor market success of the second generation. The empirical analysis exploits rich survey data from the U.S. and relies on a novel IV strategy inspired by the epidemiological approach, where an aggregate measure of national pride in the country of origin serves as an instrument for immigrants’ origin attachment. Results show that children whose parents are strongly attached to their origin country have less contact to natives and develop a stronger origin country identity, while their host country identity is not found to be affected. Consistent with the theoretical argument, they speak English less frequently and more poorly, and perform worse in school compared to peers whose parents are less attached to their origin country. Additional results from the CPS suggest negative long-term effects on labor market outcomes.","In recent years, identity has become a key topic in the public debate on immigrants’ integration. On the one hand, the observed persistence of pronounced origin country identities, even among the second and third generation, is often considered a problem for economic and social integration (e.g., Economist, 2017). On the other hand, it is argued that a lack of opportunities and acceptance in the destination countries may affect identity. Immigrants who do not feel welcome may orient back towards their country of origin and develop a strong origin country identity—with potential additional consequences for integration or return migration. Accordingly, identity has become a dimension of immigration policy in several countries, since different policies aim to improve integration by influencing the norms, values, and ultimately the identity of immigrants (e.g., Casey and Dustmann, 2010).====The economics literature indeed proposes different theoretical arguments why the national identity of immigrants may affect integration. A pronounced origin country identity will make immigrants more likely to rely on ethnic networks, leading to lower incentives to invest in country-specific human capital, and access to less productive information on the labor market (e.g., Battisti, Peri, Romiti, 2022, Battu, Mwale, Zenou, 2007, Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, et al., 2016). Importantly, this may have negative consequences for the school and labor market performance of the children of immigrants, as their investments in (country-specific) human capital partly depend on the incentives and information provided by their social environment when growing up (Bisin and Verdier, 2011).====Despite the increasing public attention and the apparent policy relevance, little is known about the effects of immigrants’ national identities on integration trajectories. The few existing studies that analyze the link between national or ethnic identity and the integration of first and second-generation immigrants, are mostly limited in their causal interpretation and show a wide range of results (e.g., Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011, Casey, Dustmann, 2010, Constant, Zimmermann, 2008, Schüller, 2015).====This paper contributes to the debate on integration by providing causal evidence on the link between national identity and long-term integration. Specifically, I focus on the origin country identity of immigrants and study its effects on integration outcomes of the second generation. The analysis relies on data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS) in the U.S., one of the few data sets that provide a large sample of immigrants and their children (Portes, Rumbaut, 2001, Portes, Rumbaut, 2008). The data comprise rich information on immigrants’ emotional attachment to their country of origin, which I exploit to construct a composite measure of origin country identity. This measure is then used to analyze the effect of parents’ origin attachment on children’s integration in the dimensions of social networks, national identity, language use and skills, and school performance.====The major challenge for identifying causal effects of immigrants’ origin attachment on integration outcomes lies in its potential endogeneity. First, reverse causality may bias this relationship, since experiences in the destination country are likely to affect the attachment of immigrants to their origin country. Second, immigrants with a strong origin attachment may differ systematically in other characteristics that favor or impede integration.====This paper’s empirical approach relies on a novel IV strategy inspired by the epidemiological approach.==== The instrument for immigrants’ origin attachment is based on the observation that the importance of national identity differs persistently across countries due to, for example, historical and cultural reasons (e.g., Smith and Kim, 2006). Using data from the Integrated Values Survey (IVS), I construct an aggregate measure of average national pride in the origin countries of immigrants, which serves as an instrument for their origin attachment. As first-generation immigrants were socialized according to the norms in their origin countries, those originating from countries with a strong average national pride may be more likely to have a pronounced origin identity as well. The key advantage of the instrument is that it is unrelated to individual-level experiences in the destination country that might make immigrants more or less origin-oriented. The IV strategy would fail if the average level of national pride in immigrants’ origin countries affects the integration outcomes of their children through omitted variables. This concern is addressed in several ways. Importantly, the main specification controls for fixed effects for broader regions of origin such that the instrument only exploits variation in national pride across relatively homogeneous origin countries. Moreover, the rich data allow to control for many characteristics on the level of the parents, children, and origin countries. Finally, several specific threats to the exclusion restriction are examined in detail in the robustness section.====The results of the first stage confirm that immigrants from countries with high national pride are substantially more attached to their origin countries. A standard deviation increase in the origin country’s average national pride increases the measure of immigrant parents’ origin attachment by 27% of a standard deviation.====When turning to the second stage, results are consistent with theoretical expectations. First, I find that immigrants’ origin identity affects their network choices and thus determines their children’s social environment at adolescence. Children whose parents are strongly attached to their origin country are more likely grow up surrounded by compatriots and have less contact to natives. One standard deviation increase in parents’ origin attachment raises their children’s probability of having only foreign friends at age 17 by 33.4 percentage points. Second, immigrant parents further transmit their origin identity to the second generation, as children are significantly more likely to identify by their origin nationality if their parents are strongly attached to their origin country. On the contrary, parents’ origin attachment is not found to affect their children’s host country identity.====Third, children of parents with strong origin attachment invest less in country-specific human capital. I find that children whose parents are strongly attached to their origin country speak English less frequently with their friends and family; furthermore, their English language skills are significantly lower. Finally, results indicate that the national identity of immigrant parents impedes their children’s school performance. Both test scores and grade point averages of second-generation immigrants decrease with increasing origin attachment of their parents.====I conduct a wide range of robustness checks. Most importantly, I discuss and investigate different threats to the exclusion restriction. First, I do not find evidence for the concern that the results could be driven by aggregate differences between countries that might be taken up by the instrument. Controlling for different aggregate measures of education, economic conditions, and culture does not affect the results.==== Similarly, results are robust when including control variables for the size, education, and labor market situation of the potential network of compatriots in the destination city. Next, I investigate whether my instrument is related to selective migration. Using country-pair data on emigrant stocks and rates by education from 195 origin countries to the U.S. (Docquier et al., 2009), I do not find evidence for negative skill-selection of immigrants from countries with high national pride. Moreover, selection with respect to the migration motive appears not to affect my results. Finally, I analyze the sensitivity of my results to deviations from the exclusion restriction via the local-to-zero approach of Conley et al. (2012). It shows that more than 50-70% of the total effect of the instrument would have to come through other channels than parents’ origin attachment to render the IV results insignificant. In additional specification checks, I show that all results are highly robust to alternative samples, alternative channels, and alternative measures of national pride.====Finally, I find consistent results with respect to education outcomes when estimating the reduced form in a representative sample of second-generation immigrants in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additional results from the CPS suggest that a stronger origin identity leads to disadvantages in the labor market for male second-generation immigrants as they have a higher risk of being unemployed and earn lower wages.====The analysis in this paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, it is closely related to the growing literature on identity in economics (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). In particular, this paper contributes to the literature on ethnic identity, its intergenerational transmission, and its effects on school or labor market performance. A couple of theoretical studies analyze the link between ethnic identity and education or labor market outcomes. Their main focus lies on the formation of oppositional identities among ethnic minorities, and on potential trade-offs between a pronounced ethnic identity and school or labor market opportunities (Austen-Smith, Fryer, 2005, Battu, Mwale, Zenou, 2007, Patacchini, Zenou, 2016, e.g.,). Empirically, a few papers study the relationship between ethnic identity and labor market outcomes of immigrants, using variables such as ethnic self-identification, language use, number of same-origin friends, or attachment to religion as proxies for ethnic identity, and producing ambiguous results on its link with labor market outcomes (Battu, Zenou, 2010, Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011, Casey, Dustmann, 2010, Nekby, Rödin, 2010, e.g.,). While some find penalties for having a strong ethnic identity (Bisin et al., 2011, e.g.,), others do not find negative effects (Casey and Dustmann, 2010, e.g.,). Again other papers focus on the formation of the destination country identity rather than the origin country identity (Manning and Roy, 2010, e.g.,).==== Most of this literature is limited in its causal interpretation as it acknowledges the difficulty to address the potential endogeneity of ethnic identity (Casey, Dustmann, 2010, Schüller, 2015). Two more recent papers in this literature are particularly related to the present study as they analyze similar questions and attempt to address the endogeneity of ethnic identity. First, Schüller (2015) studies a similar research question as she analyzes the effect of immigrants’ ethnic identity on their children’s school track choice in Germany. Using data from the GSOEP, she finds a systematic positive relationship between origin country identity of immigrant fathers and their children’s probability to be placed in a higher secondary schooling track. To address the endogeneity of ethnic identity, an extension of her specification includes family fixed effects and exploits variation within parents over time for different siblings. While this identification strategy controls for unobserved factors, it is less effective in addressing time-dependent sources of endogeneity, such as assimilation, discrimination, or other experiences in the destination country. Second, Islam and Raschky (2015) use data from the Canadian ESC survey to study the effect of ethnic identity on the labor market outcomes of immigrants. Their empirical strategy relies on an instrumental variables approach, where they use a measure of genetic distance between origin countries and Canada to instrument immigrants’ origin and destination ethnic identity. Their 2SLS estimates indicate that a strong origin country identity can have negative effects on immigrants’ employment probability. However, these effects are not very robust.====The main contribution of this paper to this literature is that it employs a novel IV strategy. It exploits variation in the importance of national feelings across origin countries to estimate the causal effects of immigrants’ national identity on integration outcomes, and transparently and extensively discusses potential threats to identification. The fact that the results are very robust to a large battery of robustness checks strengthens their causal interpretation—extending the literature on ethnic identity in this respect. Second, the paper contributes to the understanding of inter-generational effects of immigrants’ identity. It adds to the analysis of Schüller (2015), who focuses on one outcome—the school track choice at about age 10—, by analyzing the question more broadly for several integration outcomes that are theoretically motivated. Third, it uses a novel concept of ethnic identity, namely the attachment of immigrants to their origin country. By focusing on the attachment of immigrants to their origin country, the concept employed here is somewhat narrow, since it covers a particular part of the ethnic identity—the orientation towards the origin country. However, this measure of ethnic identity has the advantage that it represents effectively the idea of identity that is present in public debates on immigrants’ identity. Especially in many European destination countries, debates on long term integration have highlighted that immigrants may develop a strong orientation towards their origin countries in response to a lack of perspective and acceptance in the destination countries. While there has been the fear that this backward orientation may come at costs with regard to their further integration success, its effect is obviously hard to disentangle due to reverse causality. Analyzing this measure of ethnic identity and employing the IV strategy therefore informs this debate, since it allows to identify how a strong attachment to the origin country may causally affect integration. A fourth contribution of this paper to this literature is that it investigates the effects of national identity on the integration of immigrants in the U.S., whereas previous research on ethnic identity in the U.S. has focused on explaining racial achievement gaps.==== However, studying the role of national identity in the process of long-term integration is also an important question in the United States, as the changing composition of immigrants since the 1960s is also reflected in a larger heterogeneity in assimilation patterns among more recent immigrant cohorts.====Second, this paper contributes more broadly to the literature on the assimilation of second-generation immigrants by focusing on outcomes of this population (Borjas, 1992, Borjas, 1993, Card, 2005, Dustmann, Glitz, 2011, Sweetman, Van Ours, 2014). Furthermore, it is related to the literature on ethnic capital and ethnic networks, since the social networks of parents are found to depend on their national attachment (Battisti, Peri, Romiti, 2022, Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011, Borjas, 1992, Cutler, Glaeser, 1997, Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, et al., 2016).====Finally, this paper is related to a fast growing literature that assesses the economic effects of culture (Alesina, Giuliano, 2015, Blau, Kahn, Papps, 2011, Fernández, 2011, Fernández, Fogli, 2009, Figlio, Giuliano, Özek, Sapienza, 2019, Giuliano, 2007, e.g.,). A mostly empirical strand in this literature relies on the epidemiological approach and investigates how the culture of the country of origin influences outcomes like female labor supply (Blau, 1992, Blau, Kahn, Papps, 2011, Fernández, Fogli, 2009), fertility (Fernández and Fogli, 2009) or living arrangements (Giuliano, 2007) in the host country among second- or third-generation immigrants (see Fernández, 2011, for a survey). In a recent application, Figlio et al. (2019) analyze the effect of long-term orientation on the school performance of immigrant children in the U.S., and show that children from countries with long-term oriented attitudes perform better in school than those from cultures that do not emphasize the importance of delayed gratification. Similar to their study, the present paper focuses on children’s outcomes, and investigates the role of parents in explaining how origin-country characteristics affect children’s school success.====A main contribution to this strand of literature is that the IV-strategy in this paper allows to narrow down the channel through which culture works. Specifically, I exploit a similar type of variation as papers that employ the epidemiological approach, namely variation in an aggregate measure across origin countries of second-generation immigrants, but use it to instrument parents’ origin attachment. At the same time, the survey data provide rich information on the parents such that I can control for important characteristics that are omitted in many applications of the epidemiological approach (e.g., parents’ education and years since migration).====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section introduces a theoretical model on acculturation and the intergenerational transmission of identity to discuss theoretical mechanisms through which parents’ national identity could affect the integration of their children. Section 3 describes the data sources as well as the empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the empirical results. In section 5, I present additional results and investigate the robustness of the results. Section 6 presents additional results from the Current Population Survey, and section 7 concludes.",National identity and the integration of second-generation immigrants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000027,17 February 2023,2023,Research Article,21.0

Such support efforts often interact in unanticipated ways. This paper considers the degree to which access to mental health treatment services affects participation in federal disability programs including the Supplemental Security Income and the Social Security Disability Insurance (SS(D)I) programs. Our main approach uses an identification strategy that leverages county-level variation in the number of mental health treatment establishments to estimate changes in access to mental health treatment on SS(D)I program participation—measured by applications and awards. We also explore a series of ==== and heterogeneity analyses. Our results show that an increase in mental health facilities ==== participation in SS(D)I programs. A 10 percent increase in a county’s number of office-based mental health establishments increases the SSI application rate by 1.2 percent and the SSDI application rate by 0.7 percent. While the overall sample suggests that this does not translate to an increase in SS(D)I awards, we do find increases in awards in counties that have a higher proportion of residents below the ==== line. This suggests that increasing access to mental health resources can be a pathway through which people suffering from severe mental illness can be diagnosed and access social safety nets.","Over 46 million adults suffer from some form of mental illness in the U.S. (Ponte, 2019). Furthermore, 5.2 percent of all adults in the U.S. suffer from Serious Mental Illness (SMI)—mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders resulting in serious functional impairments that substantially interfere with or limit one or more major life activities (Ponte, 2019). The burdens of mental illness are particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to SMI, where many suffering SMI rely upon government disability benefits to survive. In this paper, we ask how additional access to mental health treatment services affects participation in federal disability programs.====Mental health has far-reaching labor market implications. Kessler et al. (2008) use 2002 data and estimate that those with SMI had annual earnings roughly $16,000 less than other respondents with the same values, resulting in a societal-level total of $193 billion.====While mental illness is one of the leading causes of sickness absences in most high-income countries (Harvey et al., 2009), fewer than half of American adults suffering from mental illness received mental health services in 2019 (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2019). A common barrier to low treatment rates is the inability to locate a provider (CBHSQ, 2015). Even after one has identified a provider, wait times at outpatient clinics often span weeks or months (Blech, West, Yang, Barber, Wang, Coyle, 2017, Steinman, Shoben, Dembe, Kelleher, 2015). At the same time, research suggests that longer wait times lead to less favorable outcomes (Steinert et al., 2017). One possible way to increase labor market participation for those suffering from mental illness could be to provide additional resources that allow individuals to identify and receive treatment for their diagnosed illness.====In this paper, we examine how expansions in office-based mental health establishments affect participation in the Social Security Administration (SSA) programs that support people with disabilities: SSI and SSDI. Using within county variation in the number of establishments from 2010 to 2016, we are able to document the extent to which additional mental health resources can affect SS(D)I participation among counties in micropolitan or larger areas.==== To speak to the concern that counties experience expansions in establishments at the same time as there is an uptick in SS(D)I participation, we create an event sample of treatment counties—that have only one expansion over the period of study—and comparison counties—that experienced no change over the same period. This allows us to estimate an event study specification and determine the validity of the empirical design.====We posit two potential ways that additional mental health establishments may impact program participation. Since bottlenecks, such as long wait times, reduce access to mental health resources, additional availability of appointments may foster mental health. This treatment could allow individuals to obtain and maintain employment, reducing participation in SS(D)I. Alternatively, additional access may increase the likelihood of proper diagnoses of SMI, which would likely increase the take-up of disability programs.====Our work contributes to two main literatures. First, we add to the literature that examines the link between mental health and labor market participation. Previous work shows that mental illness has far-reaching labor market implications on outcomes including employment, earnings, labor market entry, work hours, and absences.==== These negative consequences arise through a variety of channels, such as education (Kessler et al., 1995), discrimination (Currie and Madrian, 1999), and job performance (Chatterji et al., 2007). Our work considers the degree to which mental health treatment affects disability program participation which has direct ties to labor market participation.====Second, we contribute to the literature studying the effects of government policies and resources that affect participation in SSI. Broadly, a large literature has shown that economic factors, more aggressive welfare reform (Schmidt and Sevak, 2004), and other policies—like SNAP—affect SSI participation. Deshpande and Li (2019a) show that increasing the cost of applying for SSI—through office closures—reduced awards. Similarly, our results examine a policy lever that could reduce the costs of applying by expanding access to resources that could help with diagnoses and completing the SSI application process. While others have explored the effects of health insurance on SS(D)I participation, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the effects of local availability of mental health treatment on SS(D)I. For example, Burns and Dague (2017) show that expanding Medicaid to childless adults reduced reliance on SSI. However, additional work shows that blanket Medicaid expansions do not affect SSI participation (Schmidt, Shore-Sheppard, Watson, 2020, Soni, Burns, Dague, Simon, 2017).====Our findings indicate that an increase in the availability of mental health facilities ==== participation in disability programs. Overall, a 10 percent increase in the number of office-based mental health establishments in the county increases the SSI application rate by 1.2 percent and increases the SSDI application rate by 0.7 percent. In the aggregate, this does not translate to an increase in SSI awards that is statistically different from zero. In counties with populations that have a higher proportion of residents below the poverty line, we see that the effects on SSI and SSDI applications are larger in magnitude. Further, we find evidence in all of these subsamples that the higher application rate translates to higher proportions of SSI awards. Since these less affluent counties tend to have more people with SMI and who have earnings consistent with SSI eligibility, these findings suggest that mental health resources are an important link to benefits that may greatly assist with individuals’ necessary expenses. Deshpande (2016) found that failing age 18 disability medical review resulted in a sizable reduction in lifetime earnings, and Gelber et al. (2018) show that additional SSDI earnings reduce mortality. Providing additional access to mental health resources can potentially allow individuals suffering from SMI to access SS(D)I income that is likely necessary to meet basic needs. Further, Moore (2015) find that after individuals lost SSDI eligibility in 1996 when drug and alcohol addictions were no longer listed as qualified conditions, those with two to three year SSDI spells were able to later work at much higher rates. Together with our results, these findings suggest that for individuals with mental illness may have higher likelihoods of working after a few years of SS(D)I and continuous treatment.====We find additional evidence that greater access to office-based mental health establishments that have physicians translates to higher fractions of SSI applications, SSDI applications, and SSI awards. This finding suggests that the presence of a physician may be important for diagnoses and successfully progressing through the SSI screening process. While SSI office closures reduced SSI awards through increased application costs (Deshpande and Li, 2019a), our work suggests that the converse is also true: reducing costs—by having additional physicians in office-based mental health establishments locally—increases SSI awards. Further, our results show that both applications and awards for SSI are concentrated among mental health diagnoses, as opposed to physical health diagnoses.",The effects of expanding access to mental health services on SS(D)I applications and awards,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000143,9 February 2023,2023,Research Article,22.0

Using administrative data for France, we find that concentration negatively affects both new hires’ and incumbents’ wages with elasticities ranging from -0.0287 to -0.0296 and -0.0185 to -0.0230, respectively. It also reduces the probability that a worker be a new hire rather than an incumbent. When decomposing the overall effect of labor market concentration on wages into its different components, we find that the negative effect on incumbents’ wages accounts for between two thirds and three fourth of the total.","How labor market concentration affects wages has been the subject of a burgeoning literature in recent years. Many papers have shown that a substantial proportion of individuals are employed in labor markets that are at least moderately concentrated according to the thresholds defined by the US Horizontal Merger Guidelines and that this has a depressing effect on wages, consistent with a monopsony model - see e.g. Azar et al. (2020); OECD (2022).====However, the channels through which labor market concentration affects wages are still poorly understood. In particular, is the effect concentrated on new hires or does it also affect incumbents, i.e. individuals who were already employed in one of the establishments of their current firm the year before? If the elasticity of new hires’ wages with respect to labor market concentration is large enough, it could in principle account for the entire effect estimated in the literature, all the more that new hires represent a substantial part of the workforce in many OECD countries - on average 20% in the OECD and as much as 27% in the USA.==== If this were the case though, it would imply that labor market concentration affects wages only at the margin, i.e. for individuals who change job. For a given individual, the downward pressure on wages experienced when concentration is high would then only be transitory, since most new hires eventually become incumbents. If, in contrast, incumbents’ wages are also negatively impacted by labor market concentration, this entails that the core of the labor force is affected and that individuals may suffer the negative effects of concentration in the labor market all along their career.====In this paper, we use French data to estimate the effect of labor market concentration on total wages==== and decompose it into its effects on new hires and incumbents separately. Our contribution is twofold.====First, we provide estimates of wage elasticities with respect to labor market concentration that are not confounded by the effect of establishment-level productivity or product market competition. While these two factors likely correlate both with labor market concentration and wages, most papers in the literature do not control for them. Two noticeable exceptions are Benmelech et al. (2022) and Marinescu et al. (2021). The former control for establishment-level productivity but restrict their analysis to the manufacturing sector. To the extent that they focus on tradable goods whose market is not mainly local, they validly control for product market competition by including firm-by-time fixed effects. Marinescu et al. (2021) consider all sectors of the economy and control for productivity using covariates at the firm level. As a result, they do not take into account differences in productivity that may correlate with labor market concentration and wages at the more disaggregate (establishment) level where wages are observed. In this paper, we control for establishment-level productivity and product market competition in the strictest possible way, by including establishment-by-time fixed effects. Thus doing, we provide estimates of the elasticities of total, incumbents’ and new hires’ wages that are not affected by changes in plant efficiency and competitive pressure in downstream markets over time.====Our second contribution is to decompose the overall impact of labor market concentration on total wages. To do so, we estimate the elasticities of new hires’ and incumbents’ wages separately. If concentration in the labor market reduces workers’ outside options, we expect the former to be negative. For the same reason, we also expect the latter to be negative, to the extent that incumbents’ bargaining power will be weaker.==== We show, however, that the overall effect of labor market concentration on total wages is not the weighted sum of these two elasticities. By making outside options scarcer, labor market concentration indeed affects worker flows. This should mechanically reduce the probability that a worker be a new hire rather than an incumbent. How this affects total wages ultimately depends on the relative level of wages of new hires as compared to incumbents: if new hires are better paid than incumbents, this third component will negatively affect total wages; if, in contrast, incumbents’ wages are higher than those of new hires, it will dampen the negative effect of labor market concentration on total wages. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide such a decomposition, thereby enhancing our understanding of the different channels through which labor market concentration affects worker flows and wages.====We find that the point estimate of the effect of labor marker concentration on total wages ranges from -0.0244 to -0.0267 depending on the instrument we use. The elasticity of incumbents’ wages ranges from -0.0185 to -0.0230, i.e. between about two thirds and three quarters of the elasticity we estimate for new hires. We show that the effect of labor market concentration on incumbents is not due to the persistence of the effect that concentration had at the time they were hired since our results are robust to the inclusion of a match-specific fixed effect. Our estimates suggest that the effect of labor market concentration on new hires’ wages accounts for 30% to 34% of the overall effect on total wages, according to the instrument we use. The effect on incumbents’ wages accounts for 74% to 70% and is therefore far from negligible. The sum of both effects is slightly larger than 100% since labor market concentration reduces the probability that workers’ be new hires. Since we find that incumbents’ wages are higher than new hires’ wages, this dampens the negative effect of labor market concentration on total wages by a small 4%.====Our paper belongs to the growing literature estimating the effect of labor market concentration on wages - see e.g. Arnold (2021); Azar et al. (2019b); Benmelech et al. (2022); Dodini et al. (2020); Hafner (2021); Martins (2018); Qiu and Sojourner (2022); Rinz (2022); Schubert et al. (2021). We provide a new estimate of the wage elasticity that is not confounded by the effect of product market competition nor by establishment productivity. Our findings point to a significant degree of employers’ monopsony power in France.====We also contribute to the literature investigating the effects of labor market concentration on specific groups of workers and, in particular, new hires and incumbents. For the USA, using vacancy data, Azar et al. (2022) estimate an elasticity of posted wages with respect to labor market concentration of -0.12, without controlling for either productivity or product market competition. Focusing on new hires in France, Marinescu et al. (2021) find a wage elasticity as large as -0.05 in their preferred specification where they control for productivity and product market competition through firm-level observables. We improve on these estimates by controlling in a stricter way for these two potential confounders. Beyond looking at the effect on average market wages, Arnold (2021) also focuses on incumbents and shows that mergers and acquisitions that lead to higher concentration have a negative effect on the wages of employees who stay in the firms that have merged. We estimate the effect of labor market concentration on the wages of incumbents employed in all types of companies, not only those that have merged. The paper closest to ours is Thoresson (2021). She considers the impact of a reform of the State monopoly over pharmacies in Sweden on the wages of new hires and incumbents. In 2009, entry barriers were removed and a majority of state-owned pharmacies were privatized, thereby increasing the number of employers on the market for the corresponding industry-specific skills. Thoresson (2021) finds no effect of this reform on the wages of new hires in the pharmacy sector. In contrast, incumbents’ wages increased with elasticities to concentration ranging between -0.02 and -0.05. Our paper enlarges the scope of the analysis by considering the impact of labor market concentration on both new hires’ and incumbents’ wages in all sectors of the economy. Moreover, we determine how much of the overall effect of labor market concentration on total wages is due to the impact on the wages of each category of workers, and how much is due to the effect on worker flows, which has never been investigated so far.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out our empirical strategy and derives the decomposition of the effect of labor market concentration on total wages.

The effects are identified by exploiting monthly variation in country-level uncertainty along with pre-COVID differences in shares of occupation-state pairs in occupational country-wide employment and occupational task content. Some of the effects are consistent with the secular and episodic aspects of routine-biased technological change (RBTC) leading to job polarisation and growing complementarity between cognitive analytical and interactive tasks. Interestingly, however, other effects are seemingly at odds with RBTC-induced job polarisation and rather rationalised by idiosyncratic features of the shock (e.g. health emergency) and responses to it (e.g. social distancing, lockdowns). Although additional evidence points to high persistence of most of these effects in 2020, further research in this direction would shed light on whether the effects will persist through the post-COVID era or phase out.","The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in early 2020 has led to a global health emergency and the imposition of restrictive measures (e.g. strict lockdowns, domestic and international travel restrictions and bans, social distancing, isolation, contact-tracing) for the containment of the rapid spread of the virus. The upheaval in the labour markets around the globe was imminent and at massive scale, and has persisted to a large extent since then. The nascent literature examining the labour market implications of the COVID-19 shock has provided some first robust evidence on its unequal effects on the employment, earnings and hiring rates of workers with different demographic or other characteristics (e.g. Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020, Baylis, Beauregard, Connolly, Fortin, Green, Gutiérrez-Cubillos, Gyetvay, Haeck, Molnár, Simard-Duplain, Siu, teNyenhuis, Warman, 2021, Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2021, Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020) and on shifts of job seekers across growing and shrinking occupations and industries (Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021, Marinescu, Skandalis, Zhao, 2021, Carrillo-Tudela, Clymo, Comunello, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro, 2022).====Our goal in this paper is to advance further this literature by conducting the first comprehensive analysis on the effects of the COVID-19 shock on the relative demand for occupations, considering a broad set of occupational characteristics such as routine intensity, service-orientedness, physical contact intensity, and essentiality.==== To this end, we exploit monthly data from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) on online job postings of two-digit (SOC) occupations in all fifty US states and the District of Columbia over January 2020 – December 2020 and data on occupational characteristics from various sources. Importantly, the COVID-induced shifts in occupational composition of US labour demand that we identify allow us to derive useful insights in relation to labour market trends that were persistent in the US and other advanced economies in recent decades and until before the pandemic outbreak –most notably, job polarisation.====We begin the analysis by documenting the evolution of the country-wide number of online job postings to the total US population over the period examined. This ratio declined sharply over the first wave of the pandemic and lockdown (March–April), which accords with evidence provided by pertinent studies for the US and other countries (e.g. Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020, Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021). It recovered only partially when the lockdown was lifted (May–October), and plummeted again during the second pandemic wave and ensuing lockdown (November–December). The per-capita numbers of online job postings of different occupations also declined during the first wave of the pandemic, but the magnitudes of these declines were different, and so were the trends in the following months. As a consequence, the shares of online job postings of some occupations in the total number of online job postings (e.g. community and social service, healthcare practice, healthcare support, protective service) increased, while those of other occupations (e.g. arts and entertainment, sales, food preparation and service, personal care and service) decreased over the period examined.====Motivated by these trends, we identify the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 shock on the relative demand for different occupations by regressing the monthly share of online job postings by occupation-state pair on the interaction between a measure of occupation-state-level economic uncertainty and a measure of occupational task content. We focus on economic uncertainty as it is a key driving force of firms’ hiring decisions. To capture it empirically in the baseline specification, we rely on the monthly index of US news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) of Baker et al. (2016). We also consider using alternative measures of economic uncertainty such as the monthly composite index of US EPU (of the same study) or the monthly indices of sales revenue or employment growth uncertainty in the US, as constructed based on micro-level data of the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU). As the original measures are country-specific, we apportion these to occupation-state pairs according to their pre-COVID (2019) shares in country-wide employment of the respective occupations. Exploiting, further, variation in occupational task content is key in order to make sense of the documented differences in the relative demand for occupations during the months of 2020. Hence, the interaction term that we create is a shift-share variable, whose estimated coefficient captures the differential effects of economic uncertainty on the relative demand for occupation-state pairs, according to pre-COVID differences in their occupational country-wide employment shares and occupations’ composition of tasks.====We estimate the specification by OLS with standard errors clustered by occupation-state pair. We also control for unobserved differences across occupation-state pairs (e.g. demographic composition, levels of income and human capital) by including the relevant dummies, and for time-varying shocks to occupation-state pairs (e.g. country-wide responses of the federal government and the Federal Reserve to the COVID-19 shock) by including month dummies. As the shift-share and outcome variables are unlikely to be simultaneously determined, we interpret the OLS estimates as causal effects.====The first set of results that we obtain reveals that economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 shock exerted positive differential effects on the relative demand for occupations with relatively high non-routine cognitive interactive or manual task content –especially, when these occupations are also non-essential (e.g. community and social service, life, physical and social science, transportation and material moving), as well as occupations that have both relatively high non-routine cognitive analytical and interactive task content (e.g. architecture and engineering, management). By contrast, economic uncertainty exerted negative differential effects on the relative demand for occupations with relatively high routine cognitive or manual task content (e.g. administrative, production). Importantly, most of these effects persisted over time, as they were observed during the two pandemic waves (February–May and October–December) and the months in-between, and increased in magnitude from the one period to the next.====These findings are in accord with existing evidence showing that the secular phenomenon of routine-biased technological change (henceforth, RBTC) led to job polarisation in the pre-COVID era (e.g. Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003, Spitz-Oener, 2006, Acemoglu, Autor, 2011, Autor, Dorn, 2013, Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). They are also consistent with the episodic aspect of RBTC, implying the acceleration of the adoption of new technologies undertaking routine tasks during economic downturns and their aftermath (Hershbein and Kahn (2018); Jaimovich and Siu, 2020). The differential effect on the relative demand for occupations with both relatively high non-routine cognitive analytical and interactive task content is also consistent with existing evidence showing that RBTC has contributed to the growing complementarity between analytical and interactive tasks (Borghans et al. (2014); Weinberger (2014); Deming, 2017).====Interestingly, however, we derive an additional set of results that is seemingly at odds with RBTC-induced job polarisation and rather explained by key features of the new setting that has emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 shock. That is, a major health crisis and the imposition of restrictive measures (e.g. social distancing, lockdown) aiming at restraining the rapid spread of the virus (Ferguson, Laydon, Nedjati-Gilani, Imai, Ainslie, Baguelin, Bhatia, Boonyasiri, Cucunubá, Cuomo-Dannenburg, Dighe, Dorigatti, Fu, Gaythorpe, Green, Hamlet, Hinsley, Okell, van Elsland, Thompson, Verity, Volz, Wang, Wang, Walker, Walters, Winskill, Whittaker, Donnelly, Riley, Ghani, 2020, Gupta, Simon, Wing, 2020). According to our findings, COVID-induced economic uncertainty exerted positive differential effects on the relative demand for essential occupations –especially, those that also have relatively high routine cognitive, routine manual, service-oriented, or contact-intensive task content. Similarly, positive differential effects were exerted on the relative demand for contact-intensive occupations that also have relatively high routine cognitive, routine manual, or service-oriented task content. All these effects point to increases in the demand for healthcare practice and support and protective service occupations. Indeed, individuals in these occupations have been all along on the front line in the fight against COVID-19.====Also, the negative differential effects on the relative demand for non-essential occupations with relatively high routine cognitive or manual task content point to some occupational demand trends that are consistent with the job polarisation witnessed in the pre-COVID era, but also to other occupational demand trends that are rationalised by idiosyncratic features of the COVID-19 shock. In particular, these effects point to declines in the relative demand for administrative and some production (e.g. assembly-line) occupations, which experienced employment share losses also in the pre-COVID period –predominantly due to RBTC and offshoring– and contributed to job polarisation. However, the same effects also point to declines in the relative demand for arts and entertainment, personal care and service, and building cleaning and maintenance occupations, among others, which experienced relative employment gains in the pre-COVID period due their being largely shielded from automation and offshoring and the high demand for their services –especially, in densely-populated urban areas. Equally importantly, most of these effects were highly persistent and increasing in size from the first through the second pandemic wave.==== The novel empirical evidence of this paper contributes to four streams of literature. Our focus on identifying the differential effects of the COVID-19 shock on the demand for occupations according to their non-routine, routine, customer-oriented, and service-oriented task content emulates the influential literature making the task-based approach in order to study job polarisation and its determinants. In turn, a set of findings that we derive is consistent with key evidence of two streams of this literature. The first shows that RBTC and offshoring have been major drivers of job polarisation (Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003, Spitz-Oener, 2006, Acemoglu, Autor, 2011, Autor, Dorn, 2013, Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). RBTC also partly explains why cognitive analytical and interactive tasks have become increasingly complementary since the 1980s (Borghans, Weel, Weinberg, 2014, Weinberger, 2014, Deming, 2017). In fact, machines have started outcompeting human in the execution of some cognitive analytical tasks, while social interaction is, at least up to now, a prerogative of humans (Autor, 2015). The second stream establishes a link between RBTC and job polarisation during recessions. Hershbein and Kahn (2018) show that skill requirements in online job postings increased in US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) that were disproportionately hit by the Great Recession (2007–2009), that this effect persisted through 2015, and that it was correlated with a surge in capital investments, both at the MSA and firm levels. Relatedly, Jaimovich and Siu (2020) show that employment losses in routine occupations in the US since the early 1980s have been primarily observed during recessions, and that the lack of employment recovery in these occupations accounts almost entirely for the jobless recoveries in the aggregate.====Moreover, our approach to consider in the analysis additional occupational characteristics, namely, physical contact intensity, tele-work potential, and essentiality, is influenced by the burgeoning stream of literature studying the labour market implications of the COVID-19 shock. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider a wide range of occupational characteristics allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 shock on the demand for different occupations. In doing so, it enriches this stream of literature by deriving a set of findings that, as mentioned earlier, is consistent with evidence on job polarisation, but also another set of findings that is at odds with this phenomenon, and can rather be rationalised by features of the pandemic shock (e.g. major health crisis) and individual and collective responses to it (e.g. social distancing, lockdown).====Using data from real-time surveys conducted in the US, UK, and Germany in March and April 2020, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) document smaller job losses in the latter country, which are attributed to its firmer pre-COVID labour market institutions (e.g. short-time work schemes). They also show that job and earnings losses in the three countries were higher for workers with temporary work arrangements and those with relatively limited tele-work potential. In a similar vein, Baylis et al. (2021) find larger employment losses for women in Canada during the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak due to their larger concentration in high-viral-risk occupations, and for the less educated workers due to their lower tele-work potential. Using data from the US Current Population Survey, Cortes and Forsythe (2020) find that the COVID-19 shock has exacerbated inequalities, with the low-educated, younger, and female workers, and those of Hispanic origin experiencing larger increases in job losses and larger decreases in hiring rates. Similar evidence is also provided by Montenovo et al. (2020). Further, Mongey et al. (2021) find that while jobs in the US with low tele-work potential and those with high physical proximity requirements were hit disproportionately, those that are also essential did not.====Using data on online job postings from Burning Glass Technologies, Forsythe et al. (2020) report a collapse of over 40% in the number of job vacancies in the US by late April 2020. A collapse of similar magnitude is also reported for Sweden by Hensvik et al. (2021), who exploit data from the country’s largest online job board. However, the first study also finds that essential retail and nursing maintained or decreased slightly their job posting levels. The simultaneous rise in unemployment insurance claims made by workers in such occupations points to a great deal of churn in the US labour market. The latter is consistent with evidence provided by Barrero et al. (2020) on realised and predicted job reallocation in the US since the onset of the crisis. Exploiting rich online job postings data from LinkUp, Campello et al. (2020) show that new-hiring cuts during the COVID-19 shock were more pronounced for high-skill jobs, smaller or credit-constrained firms, highly-unionised industries, and low-income areas. Also, Althoff et al. (2022) use data from the US Current Population Survey and provide evidence on disproportionate declines during the COVID-19 shock relative to January 2020 in hours worked by individuals in low-paying service occupations in big cities due to the rising tendency of individuals in high-skill, high-paying occupations –which, by and large, also have high tele-work potential– to move away from these.====A smaller group of studies of this stream of literature look into the labour supply effects of the COVID-19 shock. Hensvik et al. (2021) provide evidence on labour market searches shifting towards occupations that have been hit less severely by the pandemic. Similar shifts have been identified by Marinescu et al. (2021), with the use of data for the US from Glassdoor, and by Bernstein et al. (2020), with the use of data from a job board focused on tech companies (Angel-List Talent). In addition, Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2022) exploit novel and rich information from the job-search module of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) on targeted and realised switches of job seekers across occupations and industries. They find that although job seekers, by and large, increasingly targeted growing occupations and industries, certain groups of job seekers (i.e., non-employed, low-educated, formerly employed in declining occupations and/or industries), targeted mostly declining occupations and industries. Equally importantly, the authors find that the mismatch between targeted and realised switches of job seekers across occupations is substantial, pointing to a high likelihood of an unemployment mismatch in the UK.====The final stream of literature to which our paper relates studies non-labour-market outcomes of economic uncertainty induced by the COVID-19 shock. Baker et al., 2020b estimate that half of the predicted US output contraction during the months of 2020 was accounted for by COVID-induced economic uncertainty, as measured by the stock market volatility (VIX), the news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), and the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU) indices. In addition, Baker et al. (2020b) show that investments in tangible and intangible capital are extremely responsive to EPU, most likely due to their irreversible nature and the relatively high associated sunk costs. There is also evidence on the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 shock on the stock market (Baker, Bloom, Davis, Kost, Sammon, Viratyosin, 2020, Leduc, Liu, 2020). Our paper emulates this group of studies in using the EPU and SBU measures in order to capture COVID-induced economic uncertainty. Unlike these studies, however, it is the first paper that does so with the aim to identify its labour market implications and, in particular, its implications for occupational demand.==== In Section 2, we describe the different datasets that we rely on and the construction of variables. We also present the main trends of online job postings and measures of economic uncertainty in the US during the COVID-19 shock, as well as the patterns of occupations by occupational characteristic. In Section 3, we give a detailed account of the econometric model and the identification strategy, while in Section 4, we present and rationalise the main results and test their robustness. In Section 5, we highlight the key conclusions drawn from the main results and indicate some promising avenues for future research.","COVID-induced economic uncertainty, tasks and occupational demand.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000106,25 January 2023,2023,Research Article,25.0

The model generates underemployment in equilibrium: workers are employed in jobs for which they are over-qualified. Subsidizing education can decrease the returns to ====, increase the underemployment rate, and decrease the unemployment rate. I calibrate the model to the U.S. economy and find the aggregate supply of human capital and underemployment rate are inefficiently low. The constrained-efficient allocation is implemented by increasing unemployment benefits and subsidizing both the creation of high-skill jobs and human capital investment.","Nearly ==== of recent college graduates in the U.S. are underemployed, i.e. have a college degree and work in occupations that do not require a college degree. Moreover, ==== of underemployment durations last at least 1 year (Barnichon and Zylberberg, 2019). Meanwhile, as seen in Fig. 1, attainment of college degrees continues to expand and there has been an enduring priority to increase the supply of college graduates via policy levers such as subsidizing tuition.====In this paper, I develop a model of underemployment and human capital investment to characterize underemployment as an equilibrium phenomena, identify the channels through which fundamentals and policy affect the underemployment rate, and study the efficiency of equilibrium allocations. I then apply the model to quantify the effect of subsidizing education on underemployment, human capital investment, and welfare.====The economy has a frictional labor market with two types of jobs (simple and complex) and workers who differ in their initial wealth. Workers self-select into education groups (less- and highly-educated), which determines their capacity to be productive at complex jobs as in Albrecht and Vroman (2002), while firms choose their job’s type based on the relative productivity of jobs and how quickly they expect to find a match. This results in a tractable framework where some workers invest in human capital and eventually meet simple jobs in the labor market.==== If such a meeting turns into a match, the worker becomes underemployed and searches on the job to eventually meet a complex job as in Dolado et al. (2009).====The decision to become underemployed is determined by comparing the endogenous relative productivity of simple to complex jobs with the worker’s opportunity cost of giving up their job search. In contrast to unemployment, underemployment does not always exist in equilibrium. If, for example, the flow utility of unemployment is large, highly-educated workers are better off unemployed than underemployed. Also in contrast to the unique equilibrium unemployment rate of the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model, there can be multiplicity of steady-state equilibria that is driven by two coordination problems. First, firms create more complex jobs if more workers invest in human capital, whereas more workers invest in human capital if firms create more complex jobs. Second, if firms coordinate to create more simple jobs, workers are more likely to become underemployed and hence invest less in education, which in turn causes more simple jobs to be created.====There are two channels through which fundamentals affect the underemployment rate. First, a ====, follows from a demand for diversity in consuming goods produced in simple and complex jobs and operates as follows.==== If the supply of highly-educated workers increases, the relative price of complex to simple jobs decreases, making workers more likely to become underemployed due to the smaller gap in earnings between simple and complex jobs. The second channel emphasized by Shephard and Sidibé (2019), the ====, focuses on how the supply of highly-educated workers can affect the composition of jobs between simple and complex jobs. A shift in the composition towards complex jobs decreases the rate at which highly-educated workers meet simple jobs and increases the opportunity cost of underemployment, as underemployed workers forgo more opportunities to meet a complex job.====With the relative price channel shut down, a decline in the price of human capital investment causes more workers to invest in human capital, the vacancy filling rate of complex jobs to increase, and more complex jobs to be created. Through the job supply channel, the underemployment rate decreases. With the relative price channel active, however, the relative price of simple to complex jobs increases as the supply of highly-educated workers increases. I show examples where, due to the change in relative prices, highly-educated workers are more likely to become underemployed and the underemployment rate increases.====The decentralized equilibrium is never constrained-efficient due to externalities in human capital investment and the formation of cross-skill matches (matches between highly-educated workers and simple jobs).==== There is a hold-up problem in human capital investment (Acemoglu, 1996, Moen, 1998) in addition to workers not internalizing differences in the magnitude of thick market and congestion externalities across education groups. As for cross-skill matches, the planner considers the total expected forgone surplus of a cross-skill match, whereas workers only consider their private share of the forgone surplus. This can make the planner choosier in forming cross-skill matches. On the other hand, the planner internalizes that forming a cross-skill match reduces congestion for other job seekers, a social benefit that can make the planner more keen on forming them.====A calibrated version of the model implies that workers under-invest in human capital, too many jobs are created, the underemployment rate is inefficiently low, and welfare (net output) is ==== lower in the decentralized allocation relative to the constrained-efficient allocation. Given the inefficiencies, there is a role for policy to both increase the supply of highly-educated workers and reduce the amount of jobs created to implement the constrained-efficient supply of highly-educated workers and underemployment rate. I find that the constrained-efficient allocation can be implemented by subsidizing ==== of the pecuniary cost of human capital, increasing unemployment benefits by ====, and subsidizing ==== of the costs to create a complex vacancy.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Using data from the 1970 to 2013 survey waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a semi-parametric error components model, we decompose annual earnings into its permanent and transitory components. Results show that the variance of transitory earnings of disabled and non-disabled men is similar before onset of a work-limiting health condition. Upon onset, earnings volatility increases significantly, and does not return to pre-onset levels until at least five years after the last reported disability. Additional results show that earnings volatility has increased since 1970 for both disabled and non-disabled men. However, the trend in volatility is steeper for those who suffer from a disability. Despite this steeper trend, disability's contribution to the total variance of earnings has remained constant over time at roughly 15%.","Researchers have documented a rise in earnings inequality over the past several decades, and a large literature exists that attempts to explain this growth. Potential explanations for higher inequality include immigration, skilled biased technological change, reductions in union bargaining power, lower purchasing power of the minimum wage, and international trade.==== Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) and Moffitt and Gottschalk (1995) were the first to note that one contributing factor to the increase in inequality is a rise in earnings instability. One factor that should affect earnings volatility is the onset of an unforeseen health condition that hinders the effected person's ability to work in the same capacity as before the shock. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the onset of a work-limiting health condition (i.e. disability) affects male earnings instability.====Research shows that male earnings instability/volatility, as measured by the variance of transitory earnings, increased over time, and this increase came in three distinct phases (Moffitt and Zhang, 2018).==== Instability first increased from the 1970s to the 1980s. In fact, the rise in the variance of transitory earnings accounts for approximately half of the increase in measured cross-sectional inequality during that period. Instability was then stable from the 1980s until around the beginning of the Great Recession, after which volatility again rose. Changes in the incidence and costs of involuntary job loss contributed to this overall rise in volatility by approximately 12 to 14% (Stevens, 2001). Earnings instability tends to be higher for African Americans and those with less education (Gittleman and Joyce, 1996), and Delaney and Devereux (2019) provide evidence that increased education causes a decline in volatility.====While many studies examine the transitory variance of earnings, how it has changed over time, and how it differs by various demographic and labor market characteristics, to our knowledge, no study exists that investigates how the onset of a work-limiting disability influences earnings volatility. Understanding the experiences of disabled individuals is important. Many view the disabled as a disadvantaged group, and understanding their experiences helps in learning of the changing nature of inequality (Haveman and Wolfe, 1990). DeLeire (2000) notes how the disabled may be less productive and/or face substantial barriers in the labor market. Some evidence suggests that the disabled suffer from wage discrimination (Johnson and Lambrinos, 1985; Baldwin and Johnson, 1994; DeLeire, 2001). In fact, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may have increased the cost of hiring the working-aged disabled, thereby lowering employment rates for this group (DeLeire, 2000).====Current research on work-limiting disabilities suggests that the onset of this type of health limitation should alter earnings instability. Work-limiting disabilities are associated with permanent losses to labor earnings and large reductions in hours worked (Stephens, 2001; Charles, 2003; Mok et al., 2008; Meyer and Mok, 2019). Evidence suggests that even 10 years after onset, the level of earnings remains 15 to 24% below what would have been earned in the absence of the disability. These financial losses translate into large downward movements in the earnings and income distributions (Nagi and Hadley, 1972; Jolly, 2013). Furthermore, disability is a fluid concept, particularly with regards to the degree to which it can limit the amount and type of work that the effected individual can perform. For example, Meyer and Mok (2019) provide evidence showing that only 65% of those reporting a non-severe disability during the previous two years will report being non-severely disabled in the current year, and 25% will report not being disabled. Therefore, as individuals transition across disability statuses or through varying degrees of work-limitation, they may alter the types of jobs held and/or the amount of work done within the same job. This would lead to changes in earnings instability over time around the date of initial disability onset.====In this paper, we use data on male household heads from the 1970 to 2013 survey waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We separate men into two samples based upon their disability status and decompose each sample's labor earnings into its permanent and transitory components. To do so, we use a semi-parametric error components model developed by Moffitt and Zhang (2018). Results show that the variance of transitory earnings for the non-disabled is similar to that of the disabled before the onset of the health condition. Upon onset, volatility increases substantially and does not return to pre-onset levels until five years after the last reported disability. When examining the calendar-year trend in instability between the two groups, we find that volatility is nearly always higher for the disabled and has a steeper slope. In other words, earnings instability has increased faster for the disabled relative to their non-disabled counterparts. This finding is more pronounced among those who are younger at onset.====Only investigating individual labor earnings ignores three important factors: severe disabilities that require full withdrawal from the labor market; spousal labor supply responses; and government transfer payments designed to assist the disabled. To account for these three factors, the entire analysis is replicated using total family income. Results from this replication also show a steeper trend in income instability for the disabled relative to the non-disabled. Therefore, the main results persist. Additional findings from this replication suggest that other sources of income help to mitigate the negative effect disability has on income instability. However, this is only true for those who are older at onset.====The paper proceeds by discussing the data and empirical methodology in Section 2.

Using longitudinal social security data and exploiting regional variation in local shocks, we identify a variety of labor market responses during the recession. We find that the costs of the recession were substantial and unequal. In the short run, a local shock of one standard deviation above the average reduced the probability of employment by 0.53% and daily wages by 0.86% in the formal sector, compared to pre-recession levels. In the long run, formal employment and wages for affected workers never returned to pre-recession levels. The effects of the recession were heterogeneous across workers, and they were disproportionately negative for men and younger workers. We also estimate the different dimensions of workers’ adjustment in response to the recession: we find that a shock that is one standard deviation above the mean reduced employment by the end of the recession, while increasing unemployment, informality, the economically inactive population, and migration to the U.S.","Economic recessions often lead to significant “scarring”: long-lasting damage to individual economic situations and to the labor market as a whole (Jacobson et al., 1993; Couch and Placzek, 2010; von Wachter et al., 2009). However, many of the long-term implications of recessions still remain unknown. Although numerous studies have documented the consequences of recessions on labor markets, most of these findings are not generalizable to a setting characterized by a large informal sector and a lack of labor market regulations. In such a setting, the effects of recessions are not necessarily limited to formal employment and wages, and they can affect other aspects of local labor markets—informality, labor force participation, and migration flows. The magnitude and persistence of these effects influence labor market dynamics, worker opportunities, and optimal policy responses.====We present comprehensive evidence on the effects of recessions on earnings and employment losses for Mexican workers during the Great Recession (2008–2009).==== Unlike previous studies, we provide a holistic quantitative assessment of various local labor market adjustment mechanisms, including migration and the transition both to informality and out of the labor force. The effects of the Great Recession are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, its depth, longevity, and its heterogeneous effects at the sectoral and regional level allow us to construct a comprehensive picture of its effects on the Mexican labor market combined with granular longitudinal data. Second, notwithstanding its differences, the current recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic can be compared to the Great Recession in a variety of ways (see Fig. A1 in the Supplementary Material).==== A better understanding of the long-term labor market effects of the Great Recession may help us to prepare better for the aftermath of the COVID-19 recession.====The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, like Yagan (2019), we estimate the long-term employment and earnings effects of the recession for individual Mexican workers. Second, in a significant departure from previous research, we investigate various mechanisms by which local labor markets adjusted to the Great Recession shock. The first question considers how much employment and earnings fell but does not discuss the different mechanisms of adjustment that operate in the labor market. To understand the timing and magnitude of these mechanisms we analyze variables such as informality, unemployment, and migration. The primary analysis is carried out using longitudinal data from 25% of the universe of formal workers (i.e., those registered with the Mexican social security system) who were observed at least once between 2005 and 2019 and who were born between 1958 and 1977 (i.e., they were 30 to 49 years old in 2007). With this data, we can determine when and where an individual worked prior to the recession and whether they relocated to a different job or region.====Mexico is an interesting case in which to study the short- and long-term labor market effects of a large recession, for a variety of reasons. First, the 2008–2009 recession in Mexico was not in any way a crisis prompted by domestic factors: it was a collateral effect of the Great Recession in the United States, the result of a purely external shock that affected the economy through several channels. Second, the magnitude of the shock was significant. Mexico's GDP collapsed by 5.3% in 2009, one of the largest contractions the Mexican economy had experienced in recent decades; it took the economy approximately two years to recover its pre-crisis GDP and economic activity levels. Third, since the economy was affected through several channels (trade, foreign direct investment, tourism, and remittances), the impact of the Great Recession had an important geographic and sectoral dispersion, a source of heterogeneity that requires a detailed analysis of the impact on labor markets during the recession.====Our empirical strategy begins with event studies that estimate the dynamic impact of employment shocks on wages and the employment rate over an extended period (2005–2019). This method allows us to provide estimates of the magnitude, length, and reaction time of key labor market variables, as well as to study potential mechanisms of labor market adjustments by affected workers. We then turn our attention to those workers who enter the labor market during recessions, as these are more vulnerable to long-term damage resulting from their entry into a struggling market. Next, we account for formal-to-informal transitions by exploiting the Mexican National Occupational and Employment Survey (ENOE), conducted by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), the primary source of labor market statistics in Mexico. The survey offers quarterly data on the country's labor force, occupations, labor informality, sub-occupations, and unemployment. We also investigate the international migration channel by developing a measure of increased migration based on a confidential version of the Mexican government's Matricula Consular (MCAS) database, which provides a detailed measure of migration flows between Mexico and the United States. Finally, we synthesize our findings to offer an accounting of the mechanisms underlying the impact of the recession on Mexican labor markets.====We restrict our study to 247 sizable municipalities (roughly equivalent to counties in the U.S.) that account for 93% of all formal workers in 2007. To identify causal effects, we build a shift-share instrument for local demand shocks that varies at the Mexican municipality level. We assign each individual to their January 2007 municipality and follow the empirical strategy of Bartik (1991) to construct an instrumental variable for local labor demand shocks by interacting differences in industrial composition with national changes in industry employment shares. The shock is then identified as each municipality's projected change in formal employment from 2007 to 2010, based on leave-one-municipality-out nationwide changes in employment, as tracked by four-digit industry categories.====We find that, conditional on 2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects, a one standard deviation increase in the Great Recession local shock reduces the average working-age formal sector employee's probability of employment by 0.53% in 2010 (the short run), and by 0.12% in 2018 (the long run). These estimates are statistically significant and robust across numerous specifications. The averages also conceal considerable heterogeneity: the most affected municipalities receive a shock that is four standard deviations greater than the average, which implies that residents in these areas are still 0.48% less likely than average to be employed in the long run. We also find that hard-hit local labor markets show less dynamic job creation during and after the recession.==== The Great Recession's influence on new job creation is far from short-term, as the gap in new job creation between slightly and severely afflicted towns lasts close to 10 years. We find similar effects on wage earnings in the formal sector: a one standard deviation increase in the size of the shock causes the average working-age Mexican worker to earn $180 MXN less per quarter by 2011. The long-run projection shows that the same worker still earns $90 MXN less per quarter in 2018 compared to the pre-recession norm.====The recession's impacts were highly uneven across local areas. Consistent with previous literature, we find larger and more persistent negative employment and earnings effects among men than among women (Kalleberg and von Wachter, 2017). Additionally, we find that although initial low-wage earners (those who earned less than the median wage in 2007) bear more of the employment effects of the local recession shocks until 2009, they also recover faster. This could be a sign of an increase in employment and wage disparity across skill levels, rather than just within skill levels in different places. The granularity of our data also lets us identify crucial heterogeneity in wages and employment between internal movers and non-movers: a typical worker can absorb the shock by relocating to a less affected municipality. We study movers who work in municipalities 100 or 200 km from their municipality of origin in 2007 and stay for at least one year after moving. The long-run estimate for the movers shows that, while they have fully recovered to their pre-recession employment levels, they still earn 90 Mexican pesos (MXN) less than their pre-recession wage.====Faced with job losses, wage cuts, and a less dynamic labor market, affected workers may adjust in many ways, including opting out of the labor force or resorting to an informal job. Workers in highly affected areas may also decide to migrate internationally. A nascent literature studies how shocks in the U.S. labor market affect outcomes in Mexican places of origin (Caballero, 2021; Caballero et al., 2021). Unfortunately, very little is known of the effect of the Great Recession shocks on migration flows, given the simultaneous interaction of push and pull factors. The use of a confidential version of the Mexican government's Matricula Consular database (MCAS) provides us with detailed measures of migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the mean local shock increases the issuance of ==== IDs to new migrants by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2010. The timing of the first statistically discernible increase in new IDs (second quarter of 2009) suggests that migration to the United States is a potential mechanism of adjustment in the presence of job losses and labor market stress.====For those workers remaining in Mexico, adjustment may come in the form of dropping out of the labor force or turning to the informal labor market. The aggregate magnitude of each adjustment mechanism is an empirical question. In the final section, we decompose changes in employment into different margins of adjustment: changes in unemployment, in labor force participation, and in formal and informal employment rates. Using the ENOE survey, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase above the mean in the Great Recession shock reduces aggregate employment by 0.36%, increases unemployment by 7.5%, increases the size of the informal sector by 1.1%, and increases the size of the economically inactive population by 0.44% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to pre-recession levels. The size and timing of this pattern is notably consistent with anecdotal evidence of how Mexican workers have dealt with the economic crisis associated with COVID-19, as well as the role of the informal labor sector in supplementing lost income due to layoffs or wage reductions (Raziel, 2021; Carbonell, 2020).====Taken together, our findings provide evidence regarding the long-term employment impact of the Great Recession and contribute to a large literature on the incidence of labor market shocks. Earlier work has found long-term impacts on individual earnings and sometimes on local employment rates (Jacobson et al., 1993; Black et al., 2002; Autor and Duggan, 2003; Davis and von Wachter, 2011; Walker, 2013; Autor et al., 2014; Yagan, 2019). We provide evidence that transitory aggregate shocks can have persistent negative employment impacts even after unemployment recovers (the view of Autor and Duggan 2003, and Yagan 2019). One branch of this literature examines the effect at the time of labor market entry and finds sizable persistent effects on employment, wages, and earnings that fade over the decade following graduation (Kahn, 2010; Oreopoulos et al., 2012; Schwandt and von Wachter, 2019; Borgschulte and Martorell, 2018). A few studies have examined migration responses to the Great Recession and how mobility affects the persistence of employment and earnings losses (Cadena and Kovak, 2016). To our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a holistic understanding of the scarring effects on these different groups of workers in the same accounting framework by providing empirical estimates of the different dimensions and mechanisms of labor market adjustment.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our data sources and the primary variables analyzed. Section 3 discusses the Great Recession‘s heterogeneous effects on local labor markets and how we measure them.

We find that in areas where firms had adopted more IT before the pandemic, the unemployment rate rose less in response to social distancing. IT shields all individuals, regardless of gender and race, except those with the lowest educational attainment. Instrumental variable estimates–leveraging historical routine employment share as a booster of IT adoption– confirm IT had a causal impact on fostering labor markets’ ====. Additional evidence suggests this shielding effect is due to the easiness of working-from-home and to stronger creation of digital jobs in high IT areas.","As COVID-19 spread across the world and the United States in 2020, people greatly reduced their mobility, stayed more at home, and spent less time producing and consuming products and services that require face-to-face interactions. These changes, caused by both voluntary behavior and various mitigation policies, have also severely damaged the economy. What are the labor market consequences of lockdowns and mobility restrictions? And can information technology (IT) mitigate these adverse effects? For everyone?====This paper analyzes the interplay between the sudden decline in mobility, its effect on the labor market, and firms’ adoption of IT in the US. It relies on several data sources, and in particular on survey data covering software and hardware purchases in 2016 for almost three million establishments in different ====.====Firm-level IT adoption can strengthen or dampen the effect of mobility on economic outcomes in several ways. On the one hand, IT adoption can cushion the impact of the pandemic by facilitating work-from-home or contact-less interactions (====, ====, ====) and by increasing online sales. IT adoption can facilitate online job search, which may be particularly important when physical mobility is reduced. Availability of IT investments and capabilities may also spur the creation of new digital-intensive jobs. On the other hand, the pandemic may reinforce the substitution of labor with technology for ex-ante heavy IT adopters (====). High-technology adopting firms may be more inclined to automate processes when the pandemic spreads as humans would be at risk of contracting the virus.====We present further evidence relying on individual-level data from the CPS (Current Population Survey) respondents and using within-state (MSA-level) variation in IT adoption while controlling for a rich set of various other potential confounding factors, such as the pre-pandemic industry and occupation of the respondent. We find that respondents living in MSAs with a larger drop in mobility are more likely to be unemployed during Spring 2020 (controlling for pre-pandemic unemployment), but the impact of mobility is less pronounced among MSAs where IT was adopted more intensely.==== by instrumenting regional-level IT adoption by its historical routine employment share. In regions where historically more routine workers were employed, IT adoption has been faster and stronger when the price of IT equipment fell and routine workers could be replaced by technology. Because of path-dependency, even today IT adoption is higher in areas where historically the routine employment share was higher than in other regions. Instrumental variable regressions confirm our OLS estimates: the impact of the mobility drop on unemployment probability is lower in areas where IT is adopted more intensely by firms. This points toward IT playing a causal role in mitigating adverse employment outcomes during a pandemic.====We quantify the effect of IT adoption relative to a counterfactual scenario in which the pandemic had hit the world five years earlier. The digital economy as a share of employment grew by around 10% relative to five years before (see ==== for details). Combining this number with our regression results, we find that the unemployment rate would have been around 2 percentage points higher during April and May 2020 if IT adoption would have been at the level of 2015. Instead of an unemployment rate of 14% the unemployment rate would have reached 16%.====The recent literature (see ====); an occupational distribution skewed towards occupations requiring in-person contacts is a main potential culprit. Therefore, IT adoption, by facilitating the delivery of contactless services and goods, may help individuals employed in these risky occupations.====).====Finally, we investigate the role of different channels in explaining the shielding effect of IT. We find that local IT adoption is strongly correlated with measures of the feasibility of working from home (====). We find that local IT adoption and the ability to work from home are both independently shielding the economy from a local mobility shock, but the role of local IT is significantly reduced when local working-from-home ability is controlled for. This suggests that part of the shielding impact of IT is due to high IT firms having facing lower disruption in the shift to work from home, but other forces are also at play. Conversely, we find no significant role for local firms’ access to e-commerce technologies.====Local unemployment can be impacted by both job destruction and ====We finally test for the importance of local demand spillover–which can be a source of general equilibrium effects at the local level–by testing whether IT shields local-level employment in tradable or non-tradable industries (====). We find no mitigating role of local IT for non-tradable industries, suggesting a minor role for such spillovers.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In ==== we present a brief literature review. In ==== we describe the data. In ==== we illustrate state-level patterns.

We apply the framework of Şahin et al. (2014) to the US and the UK to measure misallocation between job seekers and vacancies across sectors until the fourth quarter of 2021. We find that mismatch rose sharply at the onset of the pandemic but returned to previous levels within a few quarters. This implies that, as of late 2021, COVID-19 has not set in motion a large wave of structural reallocation involving significant frictions in the matching process between workers and firms. Consequently, the total loss in employment caused by the rise in mismatch has been even smaller and less persistent during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Global Financial Crisis. The results are robust to considering alternative definitions of job searchers and to using a measure of “effective” job seekers in each sector."," that have benefited from increased digitalization and shifting consumption patterns. This paper assesses the extent to which such mismatch has indeed played a significant role for US and UK labor market dynamics from the onset of COVID-19 until the fourth quarter of 2021.====The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on labor markets has been the subject of research since very early on in the pandemic (====). Since past recessions have been aligned with waves of structural transformation and reallocation of employment across sectors (====, ====), some studies have suggested that a similar process could take place in the aftermath of COVID-19 (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Salient dimensions of heterogeneity across sectors during the pandemic, which may portend longer-term shifts, have been the ability to work remotely (====), and the need for in-person interaction (====, ====). However, two years after the pandemic began, it remains unclear how persistent heterogeneity along these characteristics is, whether such shifts have in fact taken place on a large scale, and whether the labor force was able to adjust smoothly to them.====Structural reallocation often entails a period of misalignment between labor supply and labor demand across sectors, which would in turn increase frictions in the process of matching workers with firms. In this paper, we thus examine: (i) whether COVID-19 has generated labor market mismatch, in particular in comparison to the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and (ii) to what extent mismatch can explain the coexistence of tight labor markets and sluggish employment recoveries as of 2021Q4 in the US and the UK.====To this end, we apply and extend the approach proposed by ====We extend the framework of ==== in several directions that are salient for the COVID-19 recession. First, we compute the baseline measure of mismatch until late 2021, which allows us to compare the developments ensuing the COVID-19 pandemic to the aftermath of the GFC. Second, we consider COVID-specific aspects of heterogeneity by computing mismatch when grouping sectors according to their ability to work remotely and their contact intensity. Third, given the large outflows from the labor force witnessed in the first months of the pandemic, we quantify the implication of mismatch for the employment rate rather than just the unemployment rate. Fourth, for the US we exclude the temporary-layoff unemployed from our baseline measure of job seekers, as their search behavior differs markedly from that of the permanent-layoff unemployed. Finally, motivated by the peculiarities of the COVID-19 recession, such as the unprecedented rise in temporary layoffs in the US and the millions of workers covered by the government’s job protection scheme in the UK, we compute mismatch considering a broad set of alternative pools of job seekers.====Our main result is that, while mismatch grew sharply at the onset of COVID-19 in both the US and the UK, this rise was shorter-lived and, in the case of the US, smaller than during the GFC. Consequently, the employment loss due to the rise in mismatch was smaller during the COVID-19 crisis than during the GFC in both countries. Moreover, we find that mismatch across a broad aggregation of sectors grouped by teleworkability and contact intensity does not overturn this result and, somewhat surprisingly, we find that under this alternative grouping mismatch did not rise in the UK. These results are robust to considering alternative pools of job seekers, such as adding marginally attached or furloughed workers or including temporarily laid-off workers, and also to computing “effective searchers” to account for the possibility that the unemployed may search beyond their original industries. With regards to the second question, on the extent to which labor market mismatch can explain the coexistence of tight labor markets and sluggish employment recoveries as of 2021Q4, we find that sectoral mismatch accounts for about 10 percent of the existing employment gap as of late 2021 in both countries.====This finding suggests that, at least over 2020–2021, COVID-19 did not set in motion a large wave of structural reallocation involving significant frictions in the matching process between workers and firms. Therefore, the strong heterogeneity in the initial exposure of different sectors to the pandemic likely resulted primarily from the short-run impact of the lockdown measures and contagion risks. As restrictions to economic activity and health concerns receded, labor demand recovered, including in hard-hit industries, and its sectoral composition broadly returned to that of the pre-pandemic period. Reflecting this, those sectors with relatively high vacancy postings by the second half of 2021 turned out to be also those with relatively high numbers of job seekers. This stands in contrast with the GFC, where the downturn was followed by a progressive but eventually persistent contraction of the most affected sectors (manufacturing and construction) and a rise in long-term unemployment for displaced workers.====Absent a persistent rise in mismatch, other forces must be slowing the employment recovery, most likely by dampening labor supply. As discussed by recent studies, candidate explanations with empirical support include a persistent rise in inactivity for older workers (====, ====), the increased childcare duties falling on mothers of young children (====, ====, ====, ====), and demands for higher pay and better working conditions particularly for workers in low-wage occupations.==== Our paper contributes to this debate by finding that about 10 percent of the sluggish labor market recovery is attributed to the mismatch as of late 2021.====Through this country comparison, our analysis also sheds some light on the appropriateness of policies enacted by governments both to contain the initial employment contraction and to support the ensuing recovery. For instance, in the UK the furlough scheme muted the rise in job destruction and thus diminished the number of job seekers. In the US, while the initial spike in unemployment was predominantly due to temporary layoffs (====), permanent layoffs also grew and remained high throughout 2020. As the number of temporary-layoffs sharply declined starting in May 2020, the share of unemployment consisting of permanent job losers steadily rose over time, presaging long-lasting scars along the lines of previous “jobless recoveries” caused by waves of structural reallocation.==== Despite the different policy approaches, the short-lived nature of the rise in mismatch may have been a contributing factor to the initially quick employment rebound. Moreover, the slowing down of the employment recovery throughout 2021 and the emergence of acute worker shortages in some occupations –like truck drivers– spurred a debate over the need for policies to encourage jobless workers to broaden the set of sectors in which to seek employment.==== However, the concurrently low levels of mismatch partly call into question the need for policies focused on labor reallocation relative to more neutral policies supporting higher labor supply.====Our paper directly contributes to the study of sectoral reallocation in the aftermath of downturns in advanced economies, with a focus on the COVID-19 recession. ==== and ==== show that the GFC accelerated the decline in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the US, which in turn created a “jobless recovery” as displaced workers were either substituted by labor-saving capital or could not smoothly transition into other sectors. Proposing a new methodology to measure labor market mismatch, the seminal study of ==== found that higher mismatch due to sectoral and occupational reallocation accounted for up to one-third of the rise in the unemployment rate after the GFC. Their framework was also applied to the UK by ====, focusing on industries, and ====, focusing on occupations. Studying the COVID-19 pandemic through the same approach provides a useful point of comparison with the GFC. We thus contribute to this strand of research by showing that, at least by late 2021, COVID-19 had not triggered as dramatic a structural transformation of the labor market as the GFC did. Although labor demand in certain teleworkable industries rose, this increase did not appear to be large enough to cause major frictions in aggregate job creation.====Finally, our work adds to the large number of studies on labor market developments during the pandemic.

The simulations indicate that if women had the same labor market returns and the same preferences as men, their outcomes would have been similar to those of men. Moreover, the simulations show that even without any changes in their labor market conditions, women would have gained in terms of both job quality and wages if the family’s residential location was based on their human capital.","A massive wave of highly educated immigrants arrived in Israel from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) during the period 1989–1995. The labor market outcomes of the female immigrants in this wave in Israel were inferior to those of the males. Even after a number of years in Israel, there was still a substantial gender gaps in both wages and employment. The aim of this paper is to explain the sources and consequences of this gap. One common explanation is that labor market returns differ by gender. Another explanation, which we consider here, is the potential mismatch between the family’s residential location and the wife’s labor market opportunities.====Following the literature, we assume that the household chooses its residential location by concentrating on utilizing the husband’ s human capital. Based on this assumption, we develop and estimate a dynamic programing model in which married women make choices about participation and commuting, while taking the residential location of the family as given. We also estimate a model for married men (an extended version of the model that was developed in Buchinsky et al., 2014; hereafter BGL). In this model, as in BGL, men make decisions not only about participation and commuting, but also about the family’s residential location. The two models make it possible to investigate the potential impact of the aforementioned assumption on the gender gaps in wages and employment among immigrants. We use a retrospective longitudinal dataset of male and female engineers who arrived in Israel from the FSU between 1989 and 1995. The male and female engineers had very similar human capital upon arrival (in terms of education and experience). This unique sample of two groups of immigrants with similar background help us to investigate the sources of the observed gender gap.====It is important to note at the outset that we do not possess the data needed to directly investigate the family’s joint decisions. Therefore, we estimate separate models for men and women. Nonetheless, the dataset includes detailed information about the individual’s choices and outcomes, together with limited information about their spouse’s labor market outcomes.====In BGL, we examined the migration patterns of male immigrants using the same survey. Since the sample provided very little information about the labor outcomes of the individuals’ spouses, it was necessary to assume that the family chooses its residence solely based on the husband’s labor market opportunities. Consequently, the family’s decisions about the wife’s labor supply are made only after the residential location decision. Given this assumption, the model provided very strong predictions and an excellent fit to the data, which provides support for the assumption. In the current study, we focus on labor market outcomes of married female immigrants in Israel, while maintaining the assumption that the household chooses its residential location based on the husband’ s husband’ s human capital.====Given this setting, we decompose the differences in labor market outcomes between men and women into their various underlying factors. This is done on the basis of a number of illuminating counterfactual simulations. The simulations also provide circumstantial evidence that the assumed decision making process within the family is supported by our data.====For this study we estimate two dynamic programing models: one for men and other for women. We assume, as in BGL, that the family’s residential location decision is based solely based on the husband’s husband’ s human capital. Based on this assumption, in the first model (only men), we allow the individual to make optimal choices in every six-month period with respect to: (a) residential location; (b) employment; and (c) region of employment. We refer to this model as the ==== (or ALSM). In the second model (only women), we assume that the family’s residential location is taken as given, and therefore the individual can optimize only with respect to (a) employment and (b) region of employment. We refer to this model as the ==== (LSM). In both models, an individual can choose to work in one region and reside in another, but then he/she incurs commuting costs.====Both models also take into account the potential effects of regional amenities, differences in regional housing prices, and existing social networks. We also incorporate stochastic job offers and job terminations. Finally, we control for unobserved heterogeneity in a manner similar to Keane and Wolpin (1997), namely through the presence of individual types.====One of the study’s main goals is to quantify the factors–those based on behavior versus those based on the labor market–underlying the pronounced gaps in labor market outcomes between male and female immigrants in Israel. We therefore decompose the overall effects accordingly. This is achieved by means of counterfactual simulations in which we decompose the overall differences between the outcomes of men and women. We use several alternative combinations of the model’s parameters and the data, thus providing a comprehensive decomposition in the spirit of the Oaxaca decomposition.====The simulations clearly show that gaps in labor market outcomes between spouses are not a result of differences in observed human capital. Rather, if women had the same labor market returns and the same preferences as men, their outcomes would have been similar to those of men. Moreover, we conduct a simulation in which we didn’t change the job market parameters, but we allow women to make decisions regarding residential location. The results of this counterfactual suggest an increase of more than 100% in the proportion of women working in white-collar occupations and a much lower proportion in the non-employment status. This counterfactual indicates that, even without any changes in their labor market conditions, women would have gained in terms of both job quality and wages if the residential location of the family was decided based on their human capital.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data and in particular the gender differences in the data.

Students at the United States ==== Academy (USAFA) receive monthly stipends that cannot be influenced by their labor supply but have considerable and predictable monthly variation. We also observe their absences from campus, which students are required to document on detailed signout logs, and we believe reflect specifically goods-intensive leisure such as dining and entertainment. We estimate the effect of pay variation on leisure choices using difference-in-differences. A $100 increase in monthly income induces 1.8 additional hours off base and increases the frequency of longer-duration trips. Students also record 27 percent more time away from campus than average in weeks when they receive their monthly stipend. These results suggest a departure from the LCPIH using a novel outcome and in a setting where ==== and imperfect information do not appear to explain the patterns.","The life-cycle permanent income hypothesis (LCPIH) posits that consumers should make consumption decisions based on their permanent income, saving or borrowing to adjust temporal consumption patterns. In his seminal work, Friedman (1957) highlights the key empirically testable hypothesis that the transient components of income and consumption are uncorrelated but cautions that consumption should not be measured by expenditures alone but rather by the value of services received. Significant empirical work has tested this hypothesis, with some evidence supporting the LCPIH and numerous studies documenting “excess sensitivity” of consumption to transient income variation. That literature has proposed various explanations for these anomalies, with credit constraints (also raised by Friedman) and behavioral phenomenon as leading explanations. In particular, many of the apparent violations of the LCPIH occur in settings where consumers have poor access to credit or where the magnitude or frequency of income variation are insufficient to justify the mental costs of optimization.====Characteristics of student life at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) serve as a natural experiment revealing how college students change behavior due to monthly income variation. Student are paid a fixed monthly stipend (except for annual inflation adjustments) and cannot adjust their stipend by increasing or decreasing their labor hours. Net student pay, however, varies from just over $100 to over $1000 depending on date and seniority due to mandatory charges. Variation in pay both over time and across class years enables us to estimate plausibly causal effects of pay on recreational departures from campus. In addition to a difference-in-differences approach to measure the effect of the magnitude of monthly pay, we also examine how within-month variation in recreational departures from campus relates to the timing of pay. Given that students do not have the ability to change their pay by adjusting labor hours, we argue that these departures from campus reflect substitution of time-intensive leisure with goods-intensive leisure rather than a labor supply effect.====We find that students show excess sensitivity to both the amount and timing of pay in their leisure choices. First, we find that students leave campus more in months that they have higher income: a monthly stipend increase of $100 induces an additional 1.8 hours away from campus and 0.08 trips longer than 12 hours. Furthermore, more frequent departures from campus coincide systematically with the timing of monthly pay. We argue that these findings are uniquely informative due to the novel outcome measure and the setting of the study, which limits the potential impacts of imperfect information and credit constraints. The results are consistent with larger costs of budgeting to optimize consumption than have been recognized.",Income variation and excess sensitivity of goods-intensive leisure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122002032,29 December 2022,2022,Research Article,32.0

This study investigates how the Open Door Policy affected the educational choices of workers born 1960–1970. Using measures of local labor markets’ export exposure, we find the Open Door Policy decreased educational attainment; youths born from 1965 to 70 facing the mean export exposure were 5.6–13.3 p.p. less likely to complete high school than those born in 1960. Our findings suggest a complicated relationship between Chinese human capital accumulation and economic growth during the industrialization of the 1980s and 1990s, as the Open Door Policy reduced skilled labor in the most export-exposed regions.","The relationship between labor markets and educational attainment is widely studied, in part due to the difficulties in disentangling causal estimates from selection bias. In his seminal model of human capital, Becker (1962) notes that individuals invest in schooling to increase their marginal product of labor, which in turn increases their expected future wages. The effects of schooling on future wages are well-documented, though not yet entirely settled.==== Far less studied is the effect of local labor market conditions on educational attainment – how a student’s opportunity cost of continuing her education affects her decision to drop out or stay in school. In this paper, we study a massive, largely exogenous shock to local labor market conditions in China – the implementation of the Open Door Policy in late 1978 – as an extreme example of how rapidly changing local labor markets affect the opportunity costs of remaining in school.====From 1975 to 1982, the total value of Chinese exports increased from 6.2 billion to 20.4 billion US dollars, and the export share of total Chinese GDP grew from 3.79% to 9.95% over the same time period.==== This tripling of export value was one of the major driving factors behind the rapid growth in manufacturing employment, a 39 percent increase from 53 million manufacturing workers in 1978 to 74 million in 1985 (Banister, 2005). The large increase in labor demand brought relatively high-paying jobs to Chinese workers, but it also increased the opportunity cost of remaining in school. Fig. 1 suggests that students in China may have responded to these new jobs by dropping out of school; students born between 1961 and 1964 would be in high school when the Open Door Policy was implemented in 1978, and the national high school completion rate decreased by 16.7 percentage points between cohorts born in the early 1960s and the late 1960s. Similarly, students born between 1965 and 1968 would be in middle school when the Open Door Policy was enacted, and the national middle school completion rate decreased by 10.2 percentage points between cohorts born in the early 1960s and the late 1960s. And strikingly, the declines in middle school and high school completion happened to different birth cohorts; high school completion rates fell beginning with the 1962 birth cohort, and middle school completion rates fell beginning with the 1964 birth cohort. The late 1960s birth cohorts completed their education after the end of China’s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) during a time when education quality and access was improving (Giles et al., 2019); that educational attainment declined so substantially during this period suggests trade and manufacturing growth were the major driving forces.====Our primary interest in this study is to investigate this enormous, unusual decline in Chinese educational attainment across the 1960s birth cohorts, estimating whether and how much of the aggregate decline in educational attainment in China was caused by export growth after the Open Door Policy’s implementation. To accomplish this, we aim to causally identify the relationship between local labor market export exposure and the educational attainment of teens living in those labor markets. We construct Bartik-style measures of local labor market export exposure at the prefecture level, analogous to the import penetration measures used in Autor et al. (2013) and many following works. Using within-prefecture, between-birth cohort variation in export exposure measured over each cohort’s potential schooling years (ages 6 to 18 for each cohort), we find that the mean level of export exposure caused people born in 1965–70 to be 5.6–13.3 percentage points less likely to complete high school than people born in 1960. These results suggest that about 79.6 percent of the decline in high school completion over the 1960s birth cohorts can be attributed to the rise in local labor market export exposure.====Middle school completion, however, appears to be unaffected by export exposure; using the same within-prefecture, between-birth cohort variation in export exposure, we find precisely estimated null effects on middle school completion rates.==== We also can rule out internal migration as the cause of these changes in educational attainment; migration between prefectures and especially provinces was heavily restricted by the ==== system before the 1990s in China. An empirical test we perform of the association between local export exposure and changes in the youth population from 1982 to 1990 shows no relationship between export growth and internal migration during the 1980s. In this time period, high school graduates were the primary source of high-skilled labor in China, so our results demonstrate a decline in high-skilled labor and a corresponding increase in low-skilled labor occurred in the most highly export-exposed prefectures in China in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is especially important from a national growth and development perspective, as China’s rapid initial growth created incentives for its population to reduce their educational attainment, creating ambiguous effects on the future growth and development of the Chinese economy.====The paper proceeds as follows.

Both received substantial empirical support==== and are intensively studied in search and matching theory dating back to the seminal contributions by Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) and Burdett and Mortensen (1998). However, if a worker is paid below the marginal productivity and moves from one job to another a natural question to ask is whether this job transition is efficient and leads to a job with a more productive employer or not. In order to address this question and study the extent of output losses from inefficient transitions we develop a model with wage bargaining and on-the-job search where workers use their current employment as an outside option when negotiating with a new employer. One difficulty associated with this approach originates from the path-dependence of wages. This means that bargaining a higher wage with the current employer puts a worker on a higher earnings trajectory in the future which a worker with rational expectations should perfectly foresee and take into account in the bargaining process. In this study we explicitly acknowledge that workers’ rationality and foresight may reach a limit in a complex environment with path-dependent wages and consider a setup with boundedly rational workers. More precisely, workers in the model use adaptive learning based on past statistical information to form expectations about future wages.====When modeling adaptive learning we follow the approach summarized in Evans and Honkapohja (2001); Hommes and Sorger (1998) and Hommes (2013) and characterize a Restricted Perceptions Equilibrium where workers use adaptive learning mechanisms and base their forecasts on time series data. More specifically, the data on wages and productivities is collected and processed by the central statistical agency and the summary of this analysis is released to workers in the form of a recursive OLS regression. Workers use this regression to update their beliefs over time as new data becomes available. In the steady state some workers are overoptimistic about their situation and disappointed by the low wage. Other workers are pessimistic in the beginning and positively surprised by the successful outcome of bargaining. Nevertheless, the expectations of workers are “self-confirming” in the equilibrium in the sense that the data guiding workers’ expectations leads them to take actions that reproduce this data (Rotemberg, 2017).====As a starting point, we consider a benchmark model where workers obtain a fixed proportion of the job surplus. The advantage of this setup is that the model with rational expectations yields an explicit analytical solution for the wage equation, so the equilibrium outcomes can be directly compared to the outcomes of a model with boundedly rational agents and adaptive learning. In order to follow workers’ transitions over time with the corresponding changes in wages and productivities we rely on a simulation approach which is widely used for the analysis of learning mechanisms in dynamic models, for a summary see Dawid and Gatti (2018); Neugart and Richiardi (2018) and Delli Gatti et al. (2018). We find that our solution concept based on adaptive learning provides a very close approximation of the equilibrium with rational expectations, such that the differences in output and in the intensity of job-to-job transitions are negligibly small even though there is a minor wage penalty on the side of workers equal to ==== associated with imperfect foresight. To the best of our knowledge adaptive learning was not applied before in a search and matching setup with job-to-job mobility, so it is a novel methodological contribution of our study====.====Further, we extended the model with adaptive learning by endogenizing wages following a generalized Nash bargaining approach. In this setup the share of surplus accruing to workers is not constant since the marginal gains from a higher wage are not identical for workers and firms making the equilibrium with rational expectations analytically intractable. Assuming a decreasing productivity density function (Gaffeo et al., 2003), we are able to derive the analytical expressions for the value functions of workers and firms, which yields an implicit analytical solution to the Nash bargaining problem. For a restricted set of parameters, we can show that the bargaining solution is unique and the actual wage is increasing in the employer’s productivity and the current wage of the worker. We show numerically that these properties hold for a wider range of parameters.====Our model with adaptive learning and endogenous wages captures the empirical evidence that the earnings distribution is unimodal and positively skewed==== and that unemployment is followed by a lower trajectory for future wages after re-employment.==== The former property is due to the interaction between decreasing firms’ productivity density and on-the-job search by workers making jobs with higher productivity more stable. The latter property is because workers use their current employment contract as an outside option when bargaining with new employers, thus, wages depend on the past transition history of the worker. One new finding which can guide future empirical research is that wages become more dispersed and the positive skewness of the wage distribution becomes stronger with a higher bargaining power of workers.====In addition, our model delivers two new insights concerning output and wage inequality in a setting with job-to-job mobility. First, we study output losses and wage gains associated with inefficient transitions of workers. Even though workers’ job changes are always efficient from the individual perspective as workers only change the job if they get a higher wage, some transitions are socially inefficient since workers are moving from more productive employers to less productive ones. Intuitively, inefficient transitions arise from the fact that workers are paid below their (marginal) productivity, so there is a gap between the output produced by the worker and his/her wage. In this study we direct our attention to labour markets without counteroffers. Hence, if the new employer’s productivity falls within the gap a socially inefficient transition takes place. We find that a higher bargaining power of workers is associated with a lower overall frequency of job-to-job transitions and a lower fraction of inefficient transitions among them. Hence, output losses from inefficient transitions fall with a higher bargaining power due to the more efficient allocation of workers to more productive employers. For a stylized parameter setting we find that the losses amount to ==== of output, while the associated wage gains of workers vary in the range ====. This shows that inefficient transitions allow workers to exploit their status quo employment to a larger extent and reduce the average profits of firms by raising wages and reducing output.====This finding has implications for policy analysis. It suggests that promoting wage counteroffers to a wider range of (occupational) labour markets characterized by wage bargaining may lead to certain output gains and efficiency improvements provided that the costs of making counteroffers are small. Several studies with job-to-job transitions and Nash bargaining allowing for wage counteroffers are developed in Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002a, Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002b and Cahuc et al. (2006). These studies describe labour markets where employers match the outside offers of their employees (typical, for example, in academic job markets) preventing the inefficient transitions of workers to less productive employers and eliminating the corresponding output losses. Realistically, one can expect that some firms respond to the outside offers of their employees, whereas others do not. In this intermediate case some job-to-job transitions are inefficient. Thus, our estimates can be seen as an upper bound on output losses from inefficient transitions.====Second insight follows from the implications of bounded rationality in our model. In particular, we consider a market where workers are heterogeneous with respect to their bargaining power. However, this heterogeneity is unobservable by the statistical agency, so the data from different worker groups is pooled together and revealed to workers in the aggregate form. Such differences in the bargaining power could be explained by lower self-confidence or self-esteem and/or worse negotiation, presentation and argumentation skills of some worker groups. Also differences in time preferences/patience can lead to different bargaining powers, see recent evidence in Falk et al. (2018). Another example could be fine-grained ethnic or racial groups with weak bargaining power, whose types are not contained in the official statistics. We show that in this setting adaptive learning is likely to reduce the gap in wages between heterogeneous worker groups. The reason is that aggregate statistical information raises (reduces) wage expectations of workers with low (high) bargaining power, which leads to a lower gap in bargained wages. So our results suggest that information collected and revealed by central authorities may have a strong impact on labour market outcomes of boundedly-rational agents by influencing their expectations, which is not the case in a framework with rational expectations.",Expectation formation and learning in the labour market with on-the-job search and Nash bargaining,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122002019,16 December 2022,2022,Research Article,34.0

By exploiting the random assignment of students to classes within middle schools, we find that students perform better in the presence of hardworking middle-achieving peers. We examine the role of a better classroom environment, motivated learning attitudes, and responsible teachers as key mechanisms. Low- (vs. high-) achieving students are more strongly affected in terms of academic performance and learning attitude by middle-achieving peers’ positive spillovers. Therefore, teachers should give due consideration to middle-achieving students.","An increasing number of studies have focused on interactions between students with different achievement in class, especially the impact of low- and high-achieving students on student performance (Lavy et al., 2012b; Bietenbeck, 2020; Mouganie and Wang, 2020; Huang and Zhu, 2020; Xu et al., 2022).==== These studies have generally suggested that middle-achieving students do not have spillover effects and that they can be regarded as the control group for low- and high-achieving students. Importantly, these findings imply that middle-achieving students do not have peer effects on other students’ performance. However, if students in a class interact effectively, middle-achieving students may also have an impact on other students instead of being passively affected by their peers. Surprisingly, there is virtually no direct empirical evidence to examine the existence of middle-achieving peer effects or their impact on student performance.====The identification of middle-achieving peer effects may be contaminated by selection and reflection problems (Manski, 1993).==== Most studies have addressed these problems through the exogeneity and randomization of group composition (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2018; Golsteyn et al., 2021).==== Similar to these studies, our study uses randomized classroom assignments in middle schools in China to evaluate the evidence for middle-achieving peer effects. On the one hand, we use a randomized sample, which can avoid the endogeneity problem caused by students selecting classes based on classmates or classroom characteristics. On the other hand, after graduating from the 6th grade, students in China are forced to change schools and enroll in a different middle school. We use the students’ academic performance in middle school as the dependent variable and the students’ effort in the 6th grade as the independent variable. This procedure aims to avoid the endogeneity problem caused by the connection between academic performance and student effort.====We find a positive and significant impact of hardworking middle-achieving peers on student's test scores. Specifically, a one-percentage point increase in the share of the hardworking middle-achieving students can increase Math and English test scores by approximately 0.0041 and 0.0049 standard deviations, respectively. The effect is relatively smaller on Chinese scores (0.0033 standard deviations). The results indicate that middle-achieving students are as critical with regard to influence as low- and high-achieving students, which should not be overlooked in the previous literature.====In terms of the mechanisms, the middle-achieving peer effort might affect student performance through the classroom environment, student attitude, and teacher attitude. Specifically, when there are more hardworking middle-achieving peers, the classroom atmosphere improves and students tend to have more friendly classmates. In addition, students are more inclined to spend more time doing homework, have higher educational expectation, and have much pressure. Moreover, teachers tend to adopt a more interactive teaching style (question and praise students) and are more patient with and responsible for students.====Further analysis suggests that the performance disparity decreases when the classroom has more hardworking middle-scoring peers. The middle-ability peers’ positive spillovers on academic performance seems to be stronger among the low-achieving students. Moreover, exposure to higher proportions of repeat middle-ability peers is associated with a significant decrease in the students’ academic performance, consistent with the positive middle-ability peer effects. We also find statistically significant spillover effects between Chinese and English, while Chinese and Math and Math and English exhibit no significant interactions. In addition to cognitive performance, the middle-ability students also affect student mental health outcomes.====Our contribution is related to the following three strands of literature. First, this paper contributes to the literature by providing the first direct evidence on the impact of middle-achieving peers on students’ academic attainments. The most commonly used measure of peer effects is the leave-one-out mean, which assumes that all students are equally affected by others (Golsteyn et al., 2021). However, the average value may conceal the impact of structural changes within the group, and the gains of one group may be offset by the losses of another group. Some recent studies have found nonlinear effects between students with different achievement, thereby increasing the attention being paid to the peer effect structure (Hoxby and Weingarth, 2005; Lavy et al., 2012a; Mouganie and Wang, 2020) .==== However, the recent literature on ability peer effects focuses only on the effects of low- and high-achieving students while ignoring the middle-achieving peer effect. Therefore, we include low-, middle-, and high-achieving students, as well as the leave-one-out mean, in the research framework and focus on the middle-achieving peer effect. The results suggest that after controlling for a set of conventional peer effects, the hardworking middle-achieving peers have a positive effect on student performance. This finding means that there is a middle-achieving peer effect in the context of Chinese middle schools.====Second, our work uncovers the mechanisms by which middle-aptitude students affect student performance. Understanding the formation mechanism of the peer effect is crucial for the design of relevant policies (Lazear, 2001). However, the literature neglects the question of how groups who perform differently interact with each other and the further influence of this interaction on student performance (Imberman et al., 2012; Golsteyn et al., 2021) .==== Our results show that the peer effect of the different student groups affects student performance through channels such as a better classroom environment, motivated learning attitudes, and responsible teachers. Meanwhile, the middle-ability peers’ positive spillovers on academic performance seems to be stronger among the low-achieving students. This finding explains the internal mechanism of the peer effect of the middle-aptitude students in reducing the class Gini coefficient.====Third, our conclusions are helpful for understanding the causes of performance disparity from the perspective of ability peer effects. Since classmates can learn from each other, peer effects have received intense attention from researchers and policymakers in recent years. Several studies have presented convincing evidence about gender, race, personality, and family background peer effects on student performance (Angrist and Lang 2004; Hoxby and Weingarth 2005; Schøne et al., 2019; Golsteyn et al., 2021). In terms of ability peer effects, recent studies have found that high-achieving students have a role model effect, while low-achieving students have a bad apple effect, which affects student achievement. However, these studies have ignored the influence of middle-scoring students. Meanwhile, most studies have regarded test scores as an outcome while ignoring the problem of performance disparity within the class. Therefore, our study explains how the peer effect of groups with different performance affects academic performance from the perspective of the ability peer effect. The empirical results show that the middle-achieving peer effect helps to decrease English performance disparity. This finding indicates that middle-achieving students are a neglected but important group. Therefore, we suggest that schools and teachers should pay more attention to middle-achieving students.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Many studies have shown that generic teacher qualifications, such as teacher degree level, advanced degrees, or certification status are not good predictors of teacher quality (Hanushek, 1986; Rivkin et al., 2005; Clotfelter et al., 2007; Buddin and Zamarro, 2009; Staiger and Rockoff, 2010; Ladd and Sorensen, 2015). Conversely, subject-specific teacher qualifications tend to better predict teacher quality (Monk and King, 1994; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997, 2000; Croninger et al., 2007; Clotfelter et al., 2010), although findings in this field are more mixed and less abundant. Yet, a striking feature of this literature calls for caution when interpreting results: the vast majority of studies uses US data. A recent survey of high-quality studies from 2003 to 2018 investigating the effect of any teacher characteristics on student scores features no studies investigating teacher subject-specific qualifications outside the US (Coenen et al., 2018).==== A concurrent survey of the literature on teacher effectiveness and student outcomes highlights the same issue, thus questioning the extent to which existing evidence applies to other contexts (Burroughs et al., 2019). As teacher education programs vary greatly from country to country (Blomeke et al., 2008; Tatto et al., 2012), policymakers worldwide should be wary of existing evidence when devising policies concerning teachers. This deficit of evidence is even more critical for developing countries, which likely benefit the most from improving student achievement (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2015).====In this paper, I investigate the impact of subject-specific teacher qualifications—as captured by teachers holding a major in science subjects—on student science test scores in an international setting. In most contexts, estimating the impact of teacher characteristics on student outcomes is challenging. Non-random assignment of teachers to students as well as unobservable student and teacher characteristics are the most obvious concerns from an econometric standpoint. I tackle these issues in a novel way by using within-student within-teacher across-subjects variation. I exploit the availability of test scores and teacher qualifications in four science subjects—biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science—available for each 8th-grade student participating in the ==== (TIMSS, 2015). I focus on 30 countries where science is taught as an integrated subject, namely where all science subjects are taught by the same teacher, which constitute most of the countries in TIMSS 2015. Estimates obtained using the within-student within-teacher variation are not biased by unobserved student or teacher characteristics that do not vary across subjects, thus mitigating the most serious sources of bias.====I find that teacher subject-specific qualifications have a positive and statistically significant impact on student test scores. The magnitude of the impact is equivalent to 3.5% of a standard deviation (SD). Putting this figure into perspective, evidence from the US links an increase in teacher effectiveness by one SD to an increase in student math achievement by 20% SD (Jackson et al., 2014). If the variation in teacher effectiveness in the international sample that I use is similar to that in the US, teacher subject-specific qualifications would explain approximately 17.5% of the variation in teacher effectiveness. Similarly, a student would gain approximately $6825 on average in cumulative lifetime income from being taught by a teacher with subject-specific qualifications in a single grade.==== Compared to other educational inputs, the effect of teacher subject-specific qualifications is equivalent to an increase of 2 h and 10 minutes of weekly classroom instruction.====Heterogeneity analyses reveal that the impact is stronger for female students, especially when they are taught by female teachers, and for students with a lower socio-economic status (SES). Concerning teacher characteristics, the impact of teacher subject-specific qualifications is stronger for teachers who also hold a major in education and follows a concave path with respect to years of teacher experience. The analysis of cross-country heterogeneities suggests that students in lower-achieving countries benefit more from being taught by teachers with subject-specific qualifications. These findings, together with the previously described larger impact of teacher with subject-specific qualifications for students with lower SES, suggest that students in more disadvantaged contexts might benefit the most from having such teachers. To shed light on the possible mechanisms through which teachers with subject-specific qualifications affect student achievement, I conduct a mediation analysis. I find that up to 20% of the impact of subject-specific qualifications is explained by teachers being more confident to teach subjects in which they hold a major.====This paper contributes to the literature of the impact of teacher characteristics on student test scores in three ways. First, it contributes to the existing evidence on subject-specific teacher qualifications as a determinant of student achievement in an international setting. Previous studies have generally found positive effects of subject-specific teacher qualifications on student test scores, especially for math (Monk and King, 1994; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997, 2000; Clotfelter et al., 2010), although other studies have not found any effect (Aaronson et al., 2007; Harris and Sass 2011).==== However, all the evidence in this field comes from studies conducted in the US. I enrich this literature by providing first evidence that teacher subject-specific qualifications positively affect student test scores in an international setting. Further, I find a stronger effect in developing and low-performing countries. This result suggests that the current consensus of the literature on teacher qualifications may underestimate the benefits that teacher qualifications bring to students around the world. Nudging teachers to acquire subject-specific qualifications is therefore likely to be beneficial for countries worldwide, especially in developing countries.====Second, I analyze the impact of subject-specific teacher qualifications in a novel way by using a within-student within-teacher across-subjects approach, with subjects belonging to the same field. Much like the more commonly used within-student across-subjects approach====, it accounts for subject-invariant student characteristics that are known to affect student achievement, such as student ability or socioeconomic background. However, it has the additional advantage of holding constant any teacher characteristics that do not differ across subjects.==== Further, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first study that applies this approach in a context where the subjects belong to the same field, i.e., science, as opposed to different fields, such as math and reading. A key assumption of all the approaches that exploit within-student across-subjects variation is that unobserved sources of subject-specific student or teacher heterogeneity do not bias the estimates. Given the relatedness of the subjects, this assumption is more likely to hold in this case.====The third contribution of this paper is that I focus exclusively on an important yet understudied subject: science. In the recent survey of the effect of teacher characteristics on student test scores by Coenen et al. (2018), science was among the subjects analyzed in only 11 of the 58 reviewed studies, while the majority of studies focused on math and/or reading. The lack of interest in science is at odds with the current educational and political debate. Calls to nurture science skills in school to address the need for employees with a STEM background and for a scientifically literate public have been pervasive in the last decade (Carnevale et al., 2011; President's Council of the Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012; OECD, 2016; European Commission, 2020). The literature has also shown that the impact of teacher qualifications on student test scores varies across subjects. For example, the US study by Clotfelter et al. (2010) finds that the effects of teacher subject-specific certifications are, on average, positive, but very heterogeneous. Test scores of students taught by teachers with math or English certification are 11% SD and 10% SD higher, respectively, while it finds no effect for biology. Similarly, Monk and King (1994) and Goldhaber and Brewer (2000) find that teacher subject-specific qualifications have a positive impact on student math test scores, but little or no effect in science.==== Harris and Sass (2011) does not find evidence of the impact of teacher subject knowledge in math and reading acquired through undergraduate coursework on students’ math or reading test scores, but it speculates that in other areas, such as science in secondary school, teacher subject knowledge may be a determinant of student test scores. I provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 3 presents the estimation strategy. The main results, heterogeneities, international evidence, and robustness checks are discussed in Section 4. The mediation analysis is discussed in Section 5.

We show that there is a large degree of heterogeneity across countries, with about two-thirds exhibiting larger declines in women's than men's employment rates. These gender differences in COVID-19′s effects were typically short-lived, lasting a quarter or two on average. We also show that she-cessions are strongly related to COVID-19′s impacts on gender shares in employment within sectors.","The COVID-19 pandemic shock generated very unequal economic effects across individuals, with members of some worker groups suffering disproportionately (====; ====). Several recent studies have attempted to investigate differences in the effects of the COVID-19 crisis between men and women, with many arguing that the crisis has caused a “she-cession,” where women's labor market outcomes and prospects have deteriorated more than men's (====; ====; ====; ====; ====, and ====, among others). This pattern contrasts with the “he-cession” observed after the global financial crisis for the United States, in which men's employment was much more heavily impacted than women's (====; ====).====; ====). Second, women tend to carry a higher childcare burden when schools are closed, as many were due to COVID-19-related lockdowns (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Third, women are more often employed in temporary and part-time jobs that are typically more at risk of termination in an economic downturn (====; ====).==== by gender.====We find that about two-thirds of the countries in the sample experienced she-cessions when the COVID-19 shock hit in the second quarter of 2020. By contrast, only about 8 percent of the countries in our sample experienced a she-cession during the depths of the global financial crisis (2009:Q2). Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis she-cessions were short-lived, with the share of countries in the sample experiencing she-cessions dropping below half already by the third quarter of 2020.====When we examine the sectoral composition of the changes in the employment gender gap during COVID-19 crisis (for the sub-sample of countries for which we have sectoral employment by gender at quarterly frequency), we find that the incidence of she-cessions predominantly reflects greater declines in women's employment shares than men's within each sector, rather than the greater employment of women by sectors that were more adversely affected by the pandemic. In other words, she-cessions are explained more by an overall larger negative effect on women's employment than they are by women's being employed more in harder-hit sectors.====Unpacking the employment she-cessions, they appear to be more attributable to women's larger declines in labor force participation rates compared to men than a greater rise in their relative unemployment rates. The average narrowing of the she-cession gender gap changes in employment seen in 2020:Q3 appears to arise from both greater relative improvements in labor force participation by women than men and a shrinking of differences in their unemployment rates. In other words, both the participation and unemployment margins are at play in she-cessions.====Although the broad patterns point to the high incidence of short-lived she-cessions with the COVID-19 crisis, there is a wide degree of heterogeneity in the details, including policy responses, across countries. For example, Colombia had a severe she-cession, reflecting in part the preponderance of women working in the hard-hit informal sector (====; ====). In the case of the United States’ she-cession, mothers with young children saw much larger employment drops with lockdowns, partly due to the lack of access to child-care alternatives (====). On the other hand, the United Kingdom did not have a she-cession, likely as a result of its more favorable job retention and other support measures for women. ====; ====).====Our paper is related to contemporaneous work by ====, which takes a similar cross-country approach, but focuses on the cyclicality of women's and men's hours-worked and employment. ==== find significant differences in the pandemic impact across countries. They find that the pandemic generated a substantial gender gap in hours-worked in the United States and Germany. Relatedly, they also find a substantial gender gap in employment opening up in the United States, but not in Germany. These differences indicate that policy responses (such as more extensive furlough and short-time work schemes in Germany) were important in reinforcing women's labor force attachment in the wake of the crisis.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and the definition of she-cession used throughout the paper. Section III presents the baseline results on employment rates by gender.

Our evaluation design leverages the random assignment of eligibility to participate in the program through publicly held lotteries. Comparing those who are eligible with those who are not 2 to 18 months after the intervention using cross-sectional data from more than 6,000 respondents, we find that the program led to a lasting increase of around 10 percent in post-intervention monthly earnings and a small increase on number of days worked. The response to the program was highly gendered. Female beneficiaries diversified income sources and engaged more often in trading whereas men intensified agricultural production. We also document an increase in certain asset categories that mirror the gendered impacts on economic activity, as well as higher levels of happiness and satisfaction among beneficiaries. We do not find a strong link between program participation and variables that are proxies for social cohesion.","The Central African Republic (CAR) is home to one of the world's most dramatic humanitarian crises. More than 600,000 people are internally displaced (UNHCR, 2022), and just over half of its citizens need assistance after years of civil unrest and conflict that resulted in high levels of destruction and many human lives lost. Starting in 2013, violence erupted along ethno-religious lines, which led to a de facto partitioning of the country and proliferation of non-state armed groups who are in control of large portions of the country's territory and key sectors of the economy.==== The conflict in CAR is the result of several unresolved and structural shortcomings, including uneven geographic distribution of public investments, limited state presence outside Bangui (the capital), chronic poverty and weak institutions. Consequently, welfare outcomes are poor and access to basic services, health, education, sanitation and clean water is limited (World Bank, 2019). According to the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index from 2020, CAR ranks 188 out of 189 countries in the world.====Public works programs (PWPs) are a common policy response to macroeconomic shocks and are increasingly implemented in fragile and conflict-affected contexts such as CAR to fight chronic poverty and un(der)employment. These programs are meant to support the most vulnerable populations by offering short-term employment that provides a basic safety net and eventually helps beneficiaries transition to more permanent, gainful livelihoods. These were also some of the main objectives of the Londö PWP implemented in CAR starting in 2015 in most regions of the country, including areas that the government does not control.====A growing body of research is studying the effectiveness of such PWPs on improving a wide range of outcomes and in diverse contexts. In Argentina, the ==== program was designed to counter the economic crisis of 2001. Galasso and Ravallion (2004) find that the program reduced aggregate unemployment by attracting people who were unemployed and those who were otherwise out of the workforce. In India, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of 2005 caused an increase in private sector wages which translated into large welfare gains by the poor even if they did not directly take part in the program (Imbert and Papp, 2015). Other studies of this program also document an increase in real wages and labor force participation (Azam, 2012) as well as higher household food consumption and non-financial asset holdings (Deininger and Liu, 2013). Ravi and Engler (2015) also find increases in non-food expenditures, food security and the probability of holding savings. In addition to the above, see also Daidone et al. (2019) for a study that summarizes the evidence from seven evaluations of the impact of unconditional cash transfer programs on productive outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa and Gehrke and Hartwig (2018) for a review of the effectiveness of PWPs.====Nevertheless, not all evidence suggests that PWPs are effective. For example, Beegle et al. (2017) find no evidence that Malawi's large PWP (the Malawi Social Action Fund) increased beneficiaries’ food security. In another example from Sub-Saharan Africa, Bertrand et al. (2021) find no lasting impacts on employment and only limited impacts on earnings for a PWP in Côte d'Ivoire. There are also concerns about PWPs’ cost-effectiveness, especially when programs are poorly targeted (Murgai et al., 2016). Another common criticism is that PWPs crowd out other income generating activities. Bertrand et al. (2021) find such crowding-out effects from a PWP in Côte d'Ivoire as there was a shift in the composition of employment toward better-paid public works wage jobs. Datt and Ravallion (1994) study how these crowding-out effects of public employment schemes interact with time allocations at the household-level in India. Ravallion (2019) compares PWPs with programs that provide conditional or unconditional cash transfers as alternatives that are less prone to such crowding-out effects as alternatives and concludes that the question of whether guaranteed employment or guaranteed income is the preferred policy option varies with the setting. For India's NREGA, Alik-Lagrange and Ravallion (2018) document sizable welfare losses from work requirements and show that incorporating these losses in evaluating benefits switch the policy ranking in favor of unconditional cash transfers over workfare.====Against this background, using cross-sectional data from more than 6000 respondents, we evaluate the Londö PWP which provides temporary employment to vulnerable households through a workfare scheme. Beneficiaries selected through large public lotteries receive salaries for 40 days of work as well as a bicycle to commute to the worksites.==== In this way, the program was designed to provide the most vulnerable with the means to escape extreme poverty, improve public infrastructure and rebuild social cohesion. Ultimately, the pay from the workfare scheme was expected to increase beneficiaries’ economic opportunities beyond the duration of the program by allowing them to start new, or intensify current, livelihoods.====Leveraging the random selection of program beneficiaries through lotteries, we find positive impacts of Londö on beneficiaries’ productivity beyond the immediate gains from the program. Monthly earnings increased by around 10 percent, along with a modest increase in the number of days worked in the past week. This improvement seems to result from diversification of income generating activities for women, who increasingly engaged in trading, and intensification of agricultural production for men. We also find positive impacts on households’ productive assets, durable goods and livestock holdings, along with an increase in resilience. The program also improved mobility, albeit only for male beneficiaries. We attribute this pattern to gender gaps in skills and norms associated with riding a bicycle. Higher levels of reported happiness and satisfaction of program beneficiaries mirrored these tangible gains. We do not find significant improvements in outcomes that are proxies for social cohesion.====Finally, we study the distributional impacts of Londö on household wealth. The average increase in wealth masks distinctly different distributional impacts for individuals of different wealth levels, particularly for female participants. Women at the lower end of the distribution were not able to translate project participation into lasting economic gains.====Our study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, we provide further evidence of the impact of productive social protection programs in poor and fragile economies such as CAR. In this way, we add to existing studies such as Stoeffler et al. (2019) who evaluate a cash transfer program in Niger and Al-Yriani et al. (2015) who review the success behind a large safety net program in Yemen. Compared to cash transfer programs, PWPs can be administratively complex and challenging to implement which raises concerns if the institutional capacity of the implementing agency is low. Yet, these are the contexts in which PWPs may be needed the most.====Second, we contrast impacts by gender. CAR has the second lowest score on the United Nations Development Programme's Gender Inequality Index of all countries in the dataset. Identifying potential avenues to improve women's (economic) empowerment is critical. Doing so, we add to a series of other studies that sex-disaggregate welfare impact estimates. For example, Azam (2012) finds that public works in India increase labor force participation at a higher rate for women than for men. We show that women use the proceeds from the PWP to make different investment choices than men by diversifying their income sources. We also document an impact on gender norms related to household behaviors.====Additionally, we study how a PWP that provides bicycles as part of the compensation package affects mobility. Gender gaps in mobility are found around the world (Uteng, 2012), ranging from constrained mobility, which women and girls disproportionately bear, in the slums of Nairobi (Salon and Gulyani, 2010) to fewer girls than boys biking to school in the US (McDonald, 2012). The use of bicycles is particularly interesting because cycling was considered to be a part of women's liberation by offering women not only the opportunity to break into traditionally male spheres, but also a physical challenge to male dominance and gender norms (Hanson, 2010). Gender norms continue to influence the use of bicycles by men and women and are often attributed to traditional household obligations (Emond et al., 2009). Adequate policy responses to women's mobility constraints often fall short, with policies and programs frequently failing to incorporate gender issues concerns because of a lack of contextual understanding and difficulty operationalizing higher-level objectives (Riverson et al., 2006). Our study provides insights into women's ability to overcome mobility constraints by gaining access to bicycles.====Third, one rationale motivating the use of PWPs in fragile and conflict-affected settings is the claim that they can double as behavioral interventions.==== We provide novel evidence of the effectiveness of PWPs to impact norms, social cohesion and attitudes toward institutions. This is important as these programs often require men and women with different religious or ethnic backgrounds to work together which may challenge prevailing norms in some settings. In many cases, these programs also impose strict rules and worksite codes of conduct that may change behaviors in the longer-term. The Londö PWP also required participants to interact with the government in a context in which contact with formal institutions is largely absent. Evans et al. (2019) provide evidence on how a conditional cash transfer program induced trust in the government in Tanzania. Overall, however, empirical studies that demonstrate the ability of programs promoting employment to strengthen social stability is limited (Blattman and Ralston, 2015).====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides details on the Londö program. Section 3 describes the research design, the data and the estimation model we use to measure the program's impacts. Section 4 summarizes the results for the impacts at the mean and distributional impacts. Section 5 contains robustness checks, examines spillover effects and provides a simple cost-benefit analysis.

In view of these potential trade-offs, many countries are discussing the optimal design of parental leave policies. We analyze the impact of a major parental leave reform on mothers’ long-term earnings. The 2007 German parental leave reform replaced a means-tested benefit with a more generous earnings-related benefit that is granted for a shorter period of time. Additionally, a ”daddy quota” of two months was introduced. To identify the causal effect of this policy mix on long-run earnings of mothers, we use a difference-in-differences approach that compares labor market outcomes of mothers who gave birth just before and right after the reform and nets out seasonal effects by including the year before. Using administrative social security data, we confirm previous findings and show that the average duration of employment interruptions increased for mothers with high pre-birth earnings. Nevertheless, we find a positive long-run effect on earnings for mothers in this group. This effect cannot be explained by changes in the selection of working mothers, working hours or changes in employer stability. Descriptive evidence suggests that the stronger involvement of fathers, incentivized by the ”daddy months”, could have facilitated mothers’ re-entry into the labor market and thereby increased earnings. For mothers with low pre-birth earnings, however, we do not find beneficial long-run effects of this parental leave reform.","Paid parental leave as it is common in many industrialized countries has been shown to be associated with higher women’s employment rates on the one hand, but lower relative wages at extended durations of paid leave on the other hand (e.g. Ruhm, 1998). A synthesis of many empirical studies from various countries and institutional settings shows that there seems to be a non-monotonic relationship between the length of the leave and mothers’ labor market outcomes (e.g. Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). Besides promoting work-family life balance, family policy often defines additional goals such as child well-being and financial security for families that might conflict with the goal of strengthening the labor market attachment and, thereby, the economic independence of mothers. Against the background of various potential trade-offs, many countries are currently discussing the optimal design of parental leave policies. Germany implemented a parental leave reform in 2007 that changed the old parental leave benefit scheme in three important ways. First, it replaced a means-tested benefit targeted at lower-income families by an earnings related transfer that is paid to all families. Second, while the duration of job-protection (36 months) has not been changed, the maximum duration of paid leave was cut from 24 to 12 months. Depending on household income and individual pre-birth earnings, this changed work incentives for mothers in the first and second year after giving birth. Incentives to take a leave for one year have strongly increased for mothers with high pre-birth earnings. For mothers with low pre-birth earnings and low household income, incentives to take up employment in the second year after giving birth have increased. Third, the new parental leave scheme introduced a ”daddy quota” of two months. This means that two out of 14 months are earmarked individually to each parent. If one (non-single) parent does not take parental leave, the maximum duration of paid parental leave for the family is twelve months.====Several empirical evaluation studies have shown that this reform had the expected short-run labor supply effects for mothers: Labor supply of mothers with high pre-birth earnings decreased in the first year after giving birth, whereas labor supply of mothers with low pre-birth earnings increased in the second year after giving birth (see, e.g. Bergemann, Riphahn, 2011, Bergemann, Riphahn, 2015, Geyer, Haan, Wrohlich, 2015, Kluve, Schmitz, 2018, Kluve, Tamm, 2013, Welteke, Wrohlich, 2019). Much less, however, is known about the medium- and long-run effects of this parental leave reform. One study by Kluve and Schmitz (2018) has shown that the parental leave reform positively affected job characteristics such as duration of contract in the medium run, in particular for high-income mothers, in the medium-run. Evaluation studies that analyzed previous reforms of maternity leave in (West) Germany from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s have shown that extensions of paid leave and the job-protected leave have increased the employment interruptions of mothers (Schönberg and Ludsteck, 2014). These longer employment interruptions had – with one exception – no negative effects on mothers’ earnings in the medium term (i.e. up to six years after giving birth).====Our paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we broaden the focus from the short and medium-term perspective to long-term outcomes, i.e. up to nine years after giving birth. Second, we investigate the effects of the 2007 parental leave reform on mothers’ earnings - an outcome that has not been analyzed in this context so far. To this end, we use administrative data from the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) of the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) that contain information on the total population of individuals in Germany who have an employment contract subject to social security contributions. For the identification of the causal effect of the parental leave reform of 2007 on mothers’ earnings we follow previous literature on short-term effects of parental leave in Germany and exploit the quasi-experiment that was provided by the unanticipated introduction of the parental leave benefit in January 2007. In particular, we compare mothers whose first child was born in the last quarter of 2006 (control group) to mothers whose first child was born in the first quarter of 2007 (treatment group). In order to take seasonal differences into account, we add first-time mothers who gave birth to a child in the last quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 and employ a difference-in-differences approach.====Our results confirm previous findings and show that the parental leave reform has increased employment interruptions for mothers with high pre-birth earnings by almost three months on average. However, these longer employment interruptions did not lead to lower earnings in the long run. On the contrary, we find that two to nine years after giving birth, these mothers have higher earnings. This result is obtained both, in a sample of all mothers who have been employed prior to giving birth as well as in a sample of mothers returning to work after giving birth. For mothers with low pre-birth earnings, on the other hand, the results are different: we do not find positive effects on earnings in the medium and longer run (i.e. 5 to 9 years after giving birth).====Based on further empirical analyses, we are able to rule out that the positive earnings effects of mothers with high pre-birth earnings are caused by a change in working hours, socio-demographic characteristics of working mothers, changes in fertility patterns or changes in employer stability.====One potential mechanism causing the increase in mothers’ earnings in the first couple of years after giving birth could be the increased share of fathers getting involved in childcare due to the reform. Descriptive evidence shows that fathers whose partner has high earnings had the strongest reaction to the introduction of the “daddy quota” and started taking parental leave at much higher rates than the average. Previous studies have shown that paternity leave can increase fathers’ involvement in childcare and has the potential to reduce gender specialization in market work and unpaid care work. Thus, we hypothesize that the increased involvement of fathers in parental leave could have facilitated mothers’ re-entry into the labor market, increased their productivity and thereby also increased their earnings.====From a policy perspective, our results show that granting a more generous benefit in the first year in order to provide a financial safeguard for families with young children together with introducing a ‘daddy quota’ within the parental leave scheme has increased the duration of employment interruptions for certain groups of mothers without harming their long-term career perspectives. In contrast, mothers with high pre-birth earnings even experience positive effects on their earnings. Thus, the suspected trade-off between providing a safeguard for families with a new-born child and strengthening mothers’ labor market attachment and their long-term economic independence does not seem to be empirically relevant in the context of the German parental leave reform of 2007. In fact, there is suggestive evidence that this trade-off could have been mitigated by simultaneously incentivizing the use of parental leave by fathers, thereby facilitating the re-entry into the labor market for mothers after their family-related employment interruptions.====However, our results also reveal that only mothers with medium or high incomes benefited from this parental leave reform in terms of higher long-term earnings. Low-income mothers potentially lost income due to the cut of the maximum duration period, and they did not gain higher earnings in the medium or long run.====The paper is organized as follows.

While all programmes have positive effects after the lock-in period, we find substantial heterogeneity in effectiveness across programmes and unemployed. Simulations show that “black-box” reassignment rules that respect capacity constraints on average, increase, respectively decrease, the time spent in employment, respectively unemployment, by more than one month within 30 months of programme start. A shallow policy tree delivers a simple rule that realizes about 85% of this gain.","Unemployment remains an important economic and social concern in Europe, even though in the European Union (EU) the (overall) unemployment rate has steadily decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 6.8% in 2018 (Eurostat). This is particularly true for some vulnerable groups, such as youth, older workers, and migrants. Policymakers, therefore, have continued interest in getting a better understanding of which labour market policies work for whom. Such understanding helps to improve the counselling process, the design, and the allocation of active labour market policies.====Getting a better understanding of which programme works for whom, and subsequently determining a rule that can improve the allocation of individuals to programmes is challenging. First, estimators of programme effects are typically not designed to flexibly estimate treatment effects at the fine-grained individual level.==== If they do, they are likely to use some parametric model for the necessary smoothing to avoid the curse of dimensionality (e.g., as in Lechner and Smith, 2007), but this then risks biasing the estimator. Second, it is difficult to derive a general analytical rule that determines which individuals should be assigned (or not) to which programme to maximize a criterion, such as the overall time that these individuals are employed. Recent developments in causal machine learning (CML) propose methods that facilitate the quest for such heterogeneity analysis and assignment rules. In this paper, we use such a CML approach to estimate, at various levels of aggregation, the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of training programmes in Flanders, a region in the north of Belgium. We then use our estimates to simulate the extent to which the public employment service (PES) can enhance the effectiveness of these programmes by changing the assignment of unemployed job seekers to these programmes. We show that such reassignment can substantially improve allocations, demonstrating the value of using such CML methods for the evaluation of active labour market programmes.====Machine learning methods are traditionally used for prediction (e.g., Hastie et al., 2009). More recently, these methods have been modified such that they are useful for causal inference as well (see Athey, 2019, and Athey and Imbens, 2019, for overviews). This literature shows how the counterfactual causal problem (e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009) can be transformed into a combination of specific prediction problems. For this paper, these methods are of interest because they provide a way to uncover the underlying heterogeneity of the causal effects, a goal for which traditional econometric methods fail to provide a systematic solution. At the same time, we will show that the causal machine learning methods will provide very similar and, hence, reliable estimates of the ==== treatment effects as the traditional methods based on propensity score matching.====In this paper identification of the causal effect relies on the assumption of unconfoundedness. Estimation is based on the Modified Causal Forest (MCF) estimator proposed by Lechner and Mareckova (2022). This builds on the Causal Forest estimators proposed by Wager and Athey (2018). The main innovation is that Lechner and Mareckova (2022) improve on the objective function used to build the trees of the Causal Forest leading to improve performance. In addition, by using weight-based inference methods to estimate the approximate precision of the estimated treatment effects at the various aggregation levels of interest, from the individualized to the (grouped) average treatment effects, estimation and computation are simplified. Nevertheless, these methods are still vulnerable to biases induced by multiple testing. Readers must be aware that there exists currently no satisfactory solution to this problem (see Section 4.4.2).====To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first papers that applies CML methods to analyse treatment effect heterogeneity in the evaluation of active labour market policies. It appears also to be the first paper to perform such analysis in a multiple treatment context. Knaus et al. (2020) use LASSO-based methods to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of a (single) job search programme in Switzerland using administrative data from 2003. They find substantial effect heterogeneity, but only during the first 6 months after the start of programme participation. Bertrand et al. (2017) apply the Causal Forest method of Wager and Athey (2018) within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of a temporary public works programme in a less developed country. Their analysis reveals important heterogeneities, but again mostly during programme participation.====Unlike the aforementioned papers, this paper considers multiple programmes and explicitly exploits the estimated effect heterogeneity to propose reallocation rules that could increase the programme performance. Two approaches are considered. A first approach aims at finding a rule that reassigns the unemployed to programmes based on the estimated individual programme effects such that it maximizes a chosen objective – here, with equal weight, respectively maximizing and minimizing the time spent in employment and unemployment over a 30-month horizon. One practical disadvantage of this “black-box” approach is that it is not transparent, making caseworkers reluctant to implement such rules (e.g., Lechner and Smith, 2007). In addition, it may conceal that the rule implicitly raises ethical or societal concerns (e.g., Pope and Sydnor, 2011; Whittlestone et al., 2019; Rambachan et al., 2021). We therefore also consider an approach recently proposed by Zhou et al. (2022) in which optimal policy rules are derived using shallow decision trees with a small number of nodes, resulting in simple rules that are easy to comprehend.====The empirical analysis uses administrative data of the Flemish PES and is based on the population of about 60,000 individuals aged between 21 and 55 who started claiming unemployment insurance benefits after an involuntary lay-off between December 2014 and June 2016. To consider labour market outcomes during at least 2.5 years (until September 2019), we evaluate the impact of participating in a subset of training programmes that were entered within the first 9 months of the unemployment spell. We focus the analysis on three training programmes: short-term vocational training (less than 6 months, SVT), longer-term vocational training (between 6 and 10 months, LVT), and orientation training (OT) that aims at helping to determine a clear occupational goal. We could only analyse a subset of the offered training programmes, for various reasons.==== Consequently, by restricting the set of programmes that the reallocation rules consider, we provide a lower bound to the gains that a reassignment of unemployed to programmes can establish.====The interest in using data from the Flemish PES is threefold. First, the types of training offered to the unemployed are like those offered in most other EU countries, so that findings for Flanders are of general interest. Second, the administrative data is very informative. In addition to rich socio-demographic information, the data contains extensive information on labour market histories (including sickness and past programme participation) of individuals since 1991. This makes the assumption of unconfoundedness, which is used for identification, arguably plausible (see, e.g., Lechner et al. 2011, and Biewen et al., 2014). In fact, in a placebo exercise unconfoundedness could not be rejected (see Section 7.1). Third, the Flemish PES displayed a high willingness to employ CML methods in future programme evaluations and assignments.====The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows. There is a clear dominance ordering in terms of the average effectiveness of the three programmes considered, both in the short-run (lock-in effects) as well as in the medium run (post-programme effects): SVT performs best, followed by LVT. Although OT also shows positive post-programme effects, the lock-in effects are so large and enduring, that the overall effect in our observation period is negative. After 2.5 years, participation in SVT increases on average the time spent in employment by 2.5 months relative to no participation. For LVT this gain is close to zero, while participation in OT decreases the number of months in employment by 1.4. There is considerable heterogeneity in the aforementioned effects. The effects are especially higher for recent migrants with low proficiency in Dutch, which is the official language in Flanders.====Finally, we study to which extent the Flemish PES could improve the effectiveness of the training component of their ALMP by simulations that change the allocation of programme participants according to the individualized effectiveness of these programmes, following the two aforementioned approaches. Based on the black-box approach, we find that a reallocation that keeps programme capacity fixed could for the group affected by this reassignment on average increase, respectively decrease, the time spent in employment, respectively unemployment, by about one month and one week within 30 months. Shallow policy trees of depths 2 to 4 define policy rules that can achieve about 85% of this gain. These rules reveal that most gains are achieved by reallocating workers born abroad and with little employment experience in Belgium (i.e., typical profiles of recent immigrants) to short vocational training programmes. By contrast, it assigns older workers displaced from specific sectors and with little recent employment experience to long vocational programmes, consistent with the idea that such workers need intensive retraining for their professional reorientation. Finally, nobody would be reassigned to orientation training, because this programme is for most unemployed less effective than remaining unenrolled.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we describe the institutional setting and the data that are used in the analysis. Section 4 discusses the econometric methods. Section 5 presents the results with a focus on the analysis of effect heterogeneity. Section 6 simulates several alternative assignment rules.

Av. 5 de Mayo 18, Centro, CDMX, 06000 México","Received 29 October 2021, Revised 8 July 2022, Accepted 15 November 2022, Available online 21 November 2022, Version of Record 19 December 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2022.102294,Cited by (0),"In January 2019, in an effort to boost activity on the northern Mexican ====, the authorities increased the minimum wage by 100 percent and decreased the value-added tax (VAT) by half. Disentangling both effects, we find increments in prices due to the minimum wage hike that were more than offset by the decreases associated with the VAT. In the absence of both policy changes, average prices would have been higher. The share of informal labor in the production of different goods seems to be playing a role in the impact of the minimum wage on prices.","In January 2019, the Mexican==== authorities increased the minimum wage at the country’s northern border by 100% and decreased the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 16% to 8%. The policy combination aimed at boosting investment at the border while reducing incentives to migrate to the US (Conasami, Diario Oficial de la Federación). In the rest of the country, the minimum wage was raised by 16.21%, and there was no change in the VAT rate. We study the effects of such sizable policy changes on prices at the northern border, as understanding the price impact is essential to evaluate the effects on workers’ purchasing power (ILO, 2016).====The Mexican context is relevant, first, because the changes are substantial compared to other policy shifts analyzed in the minimum wage and VAT literature. Their magnitude helps identify their effects, as they may induce considerable price adjustments.==== Second, it is also relevant because of the simultaneous implementation of both policies. Their effect on prices may be countervailing, reducing the risk of a price increase that the minimum wage hike could bring about. More generally, these policies can impact employment, earnings, and living standards and may reinforce or counteract each other.====The combination of a higher minimum wage and a lower VAT tax rate may be specific to the Mexican context. However, it is not uncommon for governments to implement policy combinations when trying to achieve particular goals. Therefore, it is usually a challenge for policy evaluation to rigorously identify the specific effects of each policy on the economy and the behavior of economic agents. We are able to disentangle the effects of the two simultaneously implemented policies by exploiting a combination of industrial and geographical differences that translate into exogenous variation in the incidence of each reform.====Our identification strategy can be summarized as follows. First, to estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on goods subject to VAT, we exploit the variation in the incidence of the minimum wage across industries on the northern border. Second, we identify the effect of the minimum wage increase on Non-VAT goods using the differential increases in the minimum wage along the country’s Northern Region (northern border vs. rest of the Northern Region). Third, to estimate the effect of the VAT rate reduction, we first compare the prices of VAT goods between the northern border and the rest of the Northern Region (which yields a combined effect of VAT and minimum wage changes). Then, we subtract the estimated effect of the minimum wage on VAT goods.====We find that the lower VAT rate counteracted the price increase caused by a higher minimum wage. We estimate that the minimum wage led to a 1.2% increase in the Mexican northern border’s consumer price index. In contrast, the VAT rate reduction resulted in a 2.57% decrease, for an overall combined effect of a 1.37% price reduction. The increase in the minimum wage by itself would have, on the net, increased the purchasing power of low-wage workers at the expense of reducing real wages for high-wage and informal workers. However, the VAT rate decrease implied that the overall policy’s effect was an increase in the purchasing power of all workers.====The degree of informal labor in the production of different goods seems to be playing a role in the impact of the minimum wage on prices. In particular, the effect on Non-VAT goods, produced with a higher share of informal labor, is small and imprecisely estimated. At the same time, it is economically and statistically significant for VAT goods, which tend to have a lower degree of informality. Moreover, among VAT goods, those with lower levels of labor informality show a higher pass-through. Our analysis suggests that it is essential to consider this heterogeneity while evaluating the effects of the minimum wage on prices in countries where labor informality is a critical element in the labor market’s structure.====Many studies have found evidence of the pass-through of higher minimum wages onto prices in the US, with varying degrees of transmission (Aaronson, French, MacDonald, 2008, Leung, 2021, MacDonald, Aaronson, 2006, MaCurdy, 2015, Renkin, Montialoux, Siegenthaler, 2020). For developing countries, a survey by Lemos (2008) suggests that the evidence is mixed, although more recent studies find significant positive impacts.==== We contribute to the literature by providing estimates of the effect of a large and sudden minimum wage increase in a middle-income country. We also suggest that it is relevant to look at informal labor shares in the production of goods to understand the magnitude of the pass-through. The context also allows us to show how the effects can be counteracted by simultaneously implemented policies, like the VAT rate decrease in this case. Separating the effects is relevant for proper identification and because of the policy implications. In this regard, Campos-Vazquez and Esquivel (2020) analyze the same episode as the one analyzed in this paper but do not provide separate estimates for the impact of each policy.====On the VAT side, several papers estimate different pass-through rates of VAT changes onto prices, and some of them document important asymmetries in the effects of VAT rate increases and reductions (Benedek, De Mooij, Wingender, 2015, Kosonen, 2015, Politi, Mattos, 2011).==== Our estimates for Mexico show a partial pass-through of the VAT reduction onto prices that materializes quickly, occurring over the lapse of one month. For the Mexican context, Aportela and Werner (2002) and Mariscal and Werner (2018) study the effect of a VAT rate increase in 1995 and 2014. Our VAT elasticity estimates for the 2019 reform are higher than those found in the referred studies. Also, for Mexico, Racimo (2018) looks at elasticities to the VAT rate separating goods that are sold in formal and informal establishments, finding that they are not statistically significant in the latter case.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

Analyzing representative data from the UK, we find that the pandemic-led increases in WFH frequency are associated with a higher self-perceived hourly productivity among employed respondents. Interestingly, changes in WFH frequency are unrelated to the respondents’ weekly working hours and weekly wages during the same period. While the WFH-productivity association is more substantial in non-lockdown months, it is inexistent during the months with strict lockdowns, indicating that lockdown measures inhibited the baseline association. The WFH-productivity association is weaker among parents with increased homeschooling needs due to school closures implemented during lockdowns. In addition, the effect heterogeneity analysis identifies the role of crucial job-related characteristics in the baseline association. Finally, looking at the future of WFH, we show that employees’ recent WFH experiences and subsequent changes in hourly productivity are intimately associated with their desires to WFH in the future.","Now, many firms give their employees the option to work from home (WFH). Although a WFH arrangement has become a reality for some, many employers were hesitant to provide this option until recently, citing suspicions about employees’ misuse of freedom over assigned work and the resulting increased risk of “shirking from home.” The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, dramatically changed this pattern. In response to increasing infections and deaths, in mid-March 2020, many European governments called for social distance measures to slow the virus’ spread, including restrictions on going to work. By the end of the spring of 2020, about half of the employed population in many Western countries worked exclusively from home (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). This ‘forced’ innovation of WFH, though not a perfect “natural experiment” as not all employees could feasibly take up WFH, allowed social scientists to analyze the relationship between WFH and employee performance. With WFH expected to remain in practice even after the pandemic ends (====), a comprehensive assessment of employees’ WFH performance is relevant to establishing future policies.====In theory, WFH should increase employees’ authority over working time, pace, and workplace. Following this line of argument, some existing research suggests that increasing workers’ authority over delegated tasks can positively influence their performance (====, ====, ====) and that there is a positive link between WFH and employee performance, e.g., hourly productivity (====) and work effort (====, ====, ====). Furthermore, an individual’s job-related and household characteristics play an important role in the productivity association, which we consider in our attempt to understand the relationship between WFH and employee performance. For instance, the use of technology at work can determine the nature of the expected relationship. The employers’ ability to monitor worker efforts can vary between high-tech and low-tech sectors. Also, the degree of oversight may differ by the nature of the occupation and job function. For example, in the case of customer service call centers, employers can monitor operators’ work efforts in real time (e.g., the number of calls taken, length of calls, and ratings from end of call surveys), while such oversight is not readily available in sectors that do not use similar monitoring tools. Similarly, individuals’ household characteristics (e.g., number of children, household size, availability of a separate working room, stable internet) can determine how effectively they can work from home. For instance, parents of school-age children may find it more challenging to concentrate on their work than their childless counterparts, especially during pandemic-led school closures.====Using the novel ==== from the UK, this paper investigates whether employees’ WFH frequency is associated with their work performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependent on the availability of outcome variables, the baseline estimation sample consists of employed respondents interviewed in the following three COVID-19 survey waves: 5 (September 2020), 7 (January 2021), and 9 (September 2021). Using the information on their WFH behavior, we construct our primary explanatory variable of interest, a dummy variable indicating the increase in the respondents’ WFH frequency during the pandemic compared to the baseline period in January/February 2020. The primary outcome variable reflects the change in work performance in the same period, measured by the change in their self-reported hourly productivity. Other outcomes include employees’ weekly hours worked and weekly wages (net payments).====The baseline estimation model investigates whether increases in WFH frequency are associated with changes in the respondents’ work performance. The results show that increases in WFH frequency during the pandemic are positively related to hourly productivity. In contrast, we find that increases in WFH are unrelated to changes in weekly hours worked and wages. Further subsample analyses suggest that the positive WFH-productivity association primarily applies to employees surveyed in months when strict lockdown measures were not imposed. Furthermore, the positive association with productivity becomes weaker for parents with homeschooling needs during school closures. We then investigate the effect of heterogeneity in the baseline relationship. Concerning ====Although COVID-19-related increases in WFH offer an appropriate setting for studying the association between WFH and hourly productivity, selection into WFH may distort our findings. In particular, not all employees were forced to WFH, and those who were asked to do it were not necessarily working from home during the entire pandemic period, i.e., more employees were asked to WFH during lockdown months than in months when strict lockdowns were not imposed. Moreover, as performance measures and WFH behavior are only available for the employed during the pandemic, our results may be representative of a selective group. We exploit the richness of the data to visit the extent of selection in this context. Based on the available data and our analysis, we suggest that the estimates presented in this paper should not be interpreted as causal estimates of WFH’s impact on employee performance but simply as correlations.====Our paper makes the following contributions to existing literature. First, we contribute to the emerging literature investigating the connection between WFH and employee performance. To this end, in addition to the pre-pandemic research demonstrating the link between voluntarily-taken WFH and employee performance (====, ====, ====), we contribute to the small yet growing body of literature on the topic that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Our results indicate the existence of a modest positive association between WFH and employee productivity even when WFH is introduced by the government. Second, WFH and employee performance during the pandemic in the UK is still rarely studied. For instance, using data similar to the data analyzed in this paper, ==== report mean hourly productivity changes for individuals working from home and find that they reported higher WFH productivity in June 2020.==== Different from their approach, our analysis considers all employees, including those who never worked from home during the pandemic. In this regard, our use of a dedicated and large reference group of employees in the empirical analysis — those who observe no change in their WFH behavior or have never participated in WFH before and during the pandemic — helps us capture the general effects of the pandemic on labor market outcomes and sets the paper apart from emerging literature on the topic (====, ====, ====, ====), we further investigate whether employees’ recent WFH experiences relate to their desires to WFH in the future. We find that increases in WFH frequency and subsequent WFH productivity are intimately associated with the respondents’ willingness to perform more WFH in the future, a finding particularly relevant for policymakers and employers aiming to expand flexible WFH arrangements. Our findings also call attention to mitigating policies aimed at curing the adverse differential experiences of WFH arrangements. The results suggest that necessary support for those who WFH, especially always-open childcare facilities for working parents, should be considered.====The remainder of the paper is set up as follows. The next section elaborates on the UK’s COVID-19 pandemic situation, reviews related literature, and discusses the theoretical foundations of our expected results. ==== describes the data sources we employ, defines variables used in the empirical analysis, and outlines our estimation strategy.

Using rich administrative data for Spain, we follow workers since their entry into the labor market to measure experience accumulated under different contractual arrangements and we estimate their wage returns. We document lower returns to experience accumulated in fixed-term contracts compared to permanent contracts and show that this difference is neither due to unobserved firm heterogeneity nor match quality. Instead, we provide evidence that the gap in returns is due to lower human capital accumulation while working under fixed-term contracts. In line with skill-learning complementarity. our results suggest that the widespread use of fixed-term work arrangements reduces skill acquisition of high-skilled workers, holding back life-cycle wage growth by up to 16 percentage points after 15 years since labor market entry.","Short-term flexible labor practices are becoming increasingly popular and, together with the rise of the ==== economy, have attracted a high level of attention (Krueger, 2018). In recent years, the use of short-term work arrangements, such as temporary contracts, has become widespread in many European countries, where labor markets are relatively more rigid and regulated than those in the United States and the United Kingdom (ter Weel, 2018).====Despite allowing employers to easily adapt to fluctuations in demand (Aguirregabiria and Alonso-Borrego, 2014), the impact of temporary arrangements on worker’s labor market careers is still debated. On the one hand, workers might benefit from their availability since they ease job finding (de Graaf-Zijl et al., 2011) and mitigate wage losses associated with skill depreciation during non-employment (Guvenen, Karahan, Ozkan, Song, 2017, Jarosch, 2021). On the other hand, they could be detrimental if they induce an unstable career (Blanchard, Landier, 2002, García-Pérez, Marinescu, Vall Castello, 2019) or lower firm-sponsored on-the-job training (Bratti, Conti, Sulis, 2021, Cabrales, Dolado, Mora, 2017).====Temporary contracts might shorten non-employment spells and let workers accumulate experience with fewer interruptions, but the quality of that experience may be worse due to poorer learning opportunities, translating eventually into wage losses. In this paper we shed light on how human capital accumulates under different types of contracts, fixed-term versus open-ended, and how this affects workers’ wage trajectories during their first years in the labor market. We perform our analysis in the context of the Spanish labor market, where the use of fixed-term contracts is the rule rather than the exception: more than 90% of the contracts signed each month are fixed-term and around 25% of the workforce is under some form of temporary employment (Felgueroso et al., 2018).====We rely on rich administrative data that allow us to follow individuals since labor market entry and to measure the exact time worked under permanent and temporary contracts separately. We use these precise measures of accumulated experience to estimate reduced-form wage regressions derived from a stylized framework of human capital accumulation in a dual labor market. In our empirical analysis, we are able to control for workers’ permanent heterogeneity as well as contemporaneous job-firm characteristics. This allows us to account for sorting of the best workers into the best jobs, and hysteresis of contracts along workers’ careers. The dual nature of the Spanish labor market together with our rich dataset provide a unique setting to investigate how experience accumulated in alternative contracts shapes individual wage profiles.====We document lower returns to accumulated experience under fixed-term contracts relative to open-ended contracts. We find that, after accounting for observed match components and unobserved worker heterogeneity, one additional year of accumulated experience in permanent employment is, on average, associated with 18.5% higher returns compared to one extra year of experience in fixed-term contracts. We provide evidence that the estimated gap in returns is neither due to differences in unobserved match quality nor firms’ unobserved heterogeneity: accounting for firm-specific unobserved wage differences explains up to 15% of the gap, while removing match-specific components results in a larger gap.====Our analysis suggests that the observed difference in returns is, instead, related to worse human capital accumulation under fixed-term contracts. First, we show that the gap in returns prevails among workers who switch jobs, suggesting a human capital channel since for these workers there is a clear dissociation between the job where experience is acquired and the job where it is valued. Second, we find that the gap in returns persists when workers move to jobs with similar skill requirements, while it vanishes when they move to jobs where prior accumulated skills are less portable.====Differences in returns to contract-specific experience are positively correlated with observed and unobserved individual ability, suggesting complementarity between workers’ skills and learning opportunities. These results have important implications for life-cycle wage profiles: low-ability individuals do not suffer significant wage losses whereas high-ability workers are the most penalized. Comparing counterfactual wage trajectories in fixed-term and open-ended contracts reveals that workers at top of the ability distribution (90th percentile) may face up to 16 percentage points lower wage growth 15 years after entering the labor market, a loss that corresponds to a shift from the 67th to the 77th percentile of the wage growth distribution.====This paper contributes to different strands of the literature. A large literature has focused on the consequences of flexibility at the margin (coexistence of fixed-term contracts with low firing costs along with highly protected open-ended contracts) for labor market performance (Bentolila, Dolado, Jimeno, 2020, Boeri, 2011). One of the dimensions analyzed is the existence of contemporaneous wage differentials between temporary and permanent workers. Most of the results point to a wage penalty for workers on fixed-term contracts (e.g., Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002, Kahn, 2016, Laß, Wooden, 2019, Mertens, Gash, McGinnity, 2007) though some recent evidence highlight potential wage premiums (Albanese and Gallo, 2020). We add to this literature by focusing on how past experience accrued in temporary versus permanent jobs affects current wages. Our results suggest that the costs of being employed on temporary contracts build up over the course of workers’ careers, leading to a lower wage return on experience accumulated with fixed-term contracts.====A parallel literature has investigated the impact of temporary employment on workers’ careers. Although empirical evidence on whether temporary employment is a stepping stone or a dead end to stable employment is mixed (Filomena, Picchio, 2021, Ichino, Mealli, Nannicini, 2008), what is less controversial is that fixed-term contracts penalize workers in the long run, due to a less continuous employment path and lower wage growth (e.g., Amuedo-Dorantes, Serrano-Padial, 2007, Autor, Houseman, 2010, Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002, García-Pérez, Marinescu, Vall Castello, 2019). We contribute to this literature by showing that even when workers are able to continuously work during their career, they are penalized from acquiring experience in fixed-term contracts.====Our analysis also contributes to the growing literature that links heterogeneous returns to experience to differences in learning opportunities based on firm type (Arellano-Bover, Saltiel, 2021, Gregory, 2020, Pesola, 2011), coworkers quality (Jarosch et al., 2021), or city size (de la Roca and Puga, 2017). We show that one-the-job learning under alternative contractual arrangements also leads to heterogeneous wage-experience profiles.====We also complement the existing literature on human capital accumulation and skill transferability. Existing studies have looked at the portability of skills across industries (Neal, 1995, Sullivan, 2010), occupations (Kambourov, Manovskii, 2009, Robinson, 2018), locations (Jara-Figueroa et al., 2018), firms (Lazear, 2009), tasks (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004), or more generally across jobs (Gathmann and Schönberg, 2010). We contribute to this line of work by linking the acquisition of skills in fixed-term and open-ended contracts to their portability. We show that differences in learning opportunities between contracts generate wage penalties when workers move to jobs where their skills are transferable and could be compensated.====Finally, our paper relates to the literature that studies the consequences of flexible labor practices, such as zero-hours contracts (Dolado et al., 2021), informal contracts (Ponczek and Ulyssea, 2021), or dependent self-employment contracts (Roman et al., 2011). Our results points to lower human capital accumulation in fixed-term contracts, a channel for negative labor market performance that potentially extends to other short-term flexible work arrangements.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 characterizes the Spanish labor market, whereas Section 3 presents the conceptual framework behind our reduced-form analysis. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 introduces our econometric approach and discusses the results on contract-specific returns to experience. Section 6 explores the human capital channel behind our results, and Section 7 documents the implications for wage trajectories. Section 8 concludes.",Dual returns to experience,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001804,20 November 2022,2022,Research Article,43.0

While part-time working women expect significant hourly wage gains from switching to full-time work - 7% on average - full-time workers expect no effect on current wages when switching to part-time, on average. Perceived pecuniary losses from part-time work are most pronounced among full-time working mothers and women in managerial jobs. Using density forecasts, I document a large uncertainty about the perceived pay gap that correlates with the probability to report extreme wage penalties, as well as with worker characteristics. Comparing beliefs with selectivity-corrected estimates of the objective part-time penalty further indicates that full-time workers on average underestimate part-time wage losses, whereas part-time workers tend to overestimate full-time wage gains.","Many women will work part-time at some stage of their working career.==== Although both men and women mostly start out in full-time positions, women, more frequently than men, make adjustments to their labor supply choices (Apps and Rees, 2005; Kleven et al., 2019). One common pattern is that women sharply reduce working hours after giving birth to their first child, subsequently increasing hours as children enter day care or school, then reduce hours again when elderly relatives are in need of care.==== Despite this mobility, women remain overrepresented in part-time jobs well beyond the child-rearing years, generating substantial and persistent gender segregation in employment contracts (Petrongolo, 2004), which in turn has significant implications for gender wage gaps (Cortés, Pan, 2019, Goldin, 2014).====One key factor that may influence a woman’s decision to work part-time or to resume a full-time position after spending years in part-time employment is whether she expects wage gains or losses when moving between full-time and part-time work. In standard labor supply models, the number of hours chosen to work directly depends on expected wage offers, which may differ between part-time and full-time employment (Blundell, Costa Dias, Meghir, Shaw, 2016, Francesconi, 2002).====Previous studies analyze if women experience changes in hourly wage rates when they transition between full-time and part-time work, but unless one is willing to impose rational expectations, worker beliefs about the part-time wage penalty remain unidentified. If women fail to factor in wage losses where they exist or anticipate wage gains where there are none, they may misjudge the true costs or benefits of changing working hours, which can lead to suboptimal decision making. Moreover, even in the absence of beliefs-biases, measuring the perceived returns to full- and part-time work would release us from making unverified assumptions about rationality. Yet, whether women expect different wage rates in part-time and in full-time employment remains largely unanswered. Stevens et al. (2004), in a survey of British women about various aspects of work-life balance, report that 74% of surveyed women believe their employer pays part-time and full-time working women the same hourly wage. Boneva et al. (2021), using vignettes to depict a hypothetical family in which the mother works full-time, part-time, or stays at home, document that survey respondents predict lower life-time earnings for part-time working mothers. However, none of these existing studies measure women’s self-beliefs about their ==== perceived wage loss or gain when switching between full- and part-time work, which is arguably the more relevant criterion in labor supply decisions. For example, individuals may predict negative part-time penalties for other (hypothetical) persons but not for themselves if they are informed but overconfident. Moreover, existing work on the perceived returns to hours worked mostly focus on future returns, hence documenting the perceived long-run effects of part-time work on wage growth (Blesch, Eisenhauer, Haan, Ilieva, Schrenker, Weizsäcker, Boneva, Kaufmann, Rauh).==== Although beliefs about the long-run effects are important when agents are forward-looking, expectations about the direct or short-run impact of part-time work on current wages are of particular interest if agents are either myopic, that is, not forward-looking, or if they are present-biased, thereby prioritizing immediate over future pay-offs. To the best of my knowledge, no existing study analyzes women’s expectations about the effect of working different hours on current wages. Hence, whether women expect wage cuts for part-time work is not fully understood.====In this paper, I quantify the perceived hourly wage losses and gains from working different hours on the same job among a representative sample of working women. I utilize a within-subject design with hypothetical scenarios implemented in a survey experiment, hence comparing the part-time and the full-time scenarios at the individual respondent level. The within-subject design allows me to evaluate the perceived wage changes associated with working different hours while holding constant individual and job characteristics. Specifically, I ask full-time working respondents to consider a hypothetical transition to working part-time at 20 hours per week, ceteris paribus, and report the anticipated wage offer associated with this transition. Conversely, part-time working respondents are asked to report their expected wage offer for a hypothetical transition to working full-time at 40 hours per week. Utilizing information on current earnings and working hours, I measure the perceived hourly part-time wage penalty among full-time working respondents, and the perceived full-time wage premium among part-time working respondents. I integrate the survey experiment into the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016–2019. The SOEP-IS is a moderately sized survey of German households that is representative of the German population, thus allowing me to study the expectations of employed women across various backgrounds and occupations.====I find that full-time working women, on average, expect no hourly wage cuts for switching to part-time (0.21 percent, p====0.1). However, part-time working women expect notable full-time wage premiums (6.70 percent, p====0.01). The asymmetry between full-time and part-time working women is amplified further when estimates of the wage penalties and premiums account for current overtime. Thus, women’s beliefs do not appear to be affected by cognitive dissonance, the inclination to report beliefs that justify past choices, which is a commonly voiced concern with subjective data (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001), but seems to be less relevant here.====In studying the disagreement between workers about the part-time penalty, I document that motherhood is a significant correlate of belief heterogeneity among full-time workers. Full-time working women with children expect 6.74 percentage points stronger wage losses from part-time work compared to non-mothers (p====0.1), suggesting that these women may have self-selected into full-time employment precisely because they would face a wage penalty if they chose to work part-time on that job. However, the majority of mothers work part-time. Among part-time workers, both mothers and non-mothers expect similarly high returns to full-time employment of about 7 percent. Adding to previous findings by Boneva et al. (2021) who show that individuals predict pecuniary losses for part-time working mothers, I document that mothers themselves perceive the relationship between hours and their own earnings as convex.====Besides analyzing the point forecasts of counterfactual wage offers, I quantify respondents’ uncertainty about the perceived wage penalties and premiums. Using the methods proposed by Engelberg et al. (2009) and Bellemare et al. (2012), I construct density forecasts from subjective bin probabilities to measure belief uncertainty and to evaluate the robustness of the point forecasts as measures of subjective central tendency. I find that full-time workers tend to report point estimates that correspond to the lower percentiles of their subjective distribution, in line with point-prediction optimism (Engelberg et al., 2009). The extent to which point estimates deviate from subjective means further correlates with belief uncertainty. I also show that workers who are more uncertain expect more extreme wage penalties and premiums. Overall, belief uncertainty is substantial, with respondents assigning large probabilities to penalties above 20 percent and below -20 percent. Observable characteristics can to some extent predict uncertainty among full-time workers, but barely among part-time workers. Regional variation in uncertainty indicates that there might be learning effects, given that full-time workers in Eastern Germany - where part-time employment is less common - reveal higher uncertainty about the part-time penalty.====To further interpret and evaluate workers’ beliefs, I estimate the returns to full- and part-time work from observed data, using these estimates as proxies of the objective pay penalty and the premium of working different hours, controlling for job and worker characteristics. Estimates of the observed returns are then compared to the perceived returns. To compute the observed returns, I build a static structural discrete choice model of female labor supply and estimate the model on a sample of German women that is comparable to the SOEP-IS sample, exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the larger German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to model selection into part-time, full-time, and non-employment. To account for the endogeneity of wages and working hours, I estimate counterfactual full-time and part-time wage offers jointly with a multinomial logit hours equation, building on Van Soest (1995) and Francesconi (2002).====In comparing estimates of the observed returns with women’s expectations, I provide suggestive evidence of a mismatch between women’s beliefs and objective data. Adding to previous work by Hirsch (2005) who documents stronger effects on hourly wages for full-time workers moving to part-time than for part-time workers moving to full-time, I find that part-time workers appear to overestimate full-time wage gains, whereas full-time workers seem to underestimate part-time wage losses. The apparent mismatch is consistent with worker overconfidence, possibly driven by misperceptions about the returns to work experience accumulated in full- and part-time employment. Although suggestive, these findings have some interesting implications for women’s labor supply decisions, as discussed below.====In a set of robustness checks, I use alternative measures of working hours and part-time status to ensure that results do not depend on a specific hours threshold or on the exclusion of overtime. I further provide non-structural estimates of the observed part-time wage penalty based on OLS and fixed effects regressions of Mincerian log-wage equations. Moreover, I extensively discuss the role of nonwage benefits for workers’ perceptions of the relative returns to full- and part-time work.====The results from this paper contribute to our understanding of observed choice patterns in many OECD labor markets, where female part-time shares reach levels up to 60 percent.==== The beliefs documented in this paper can rationalize why few women hesitate to reduce hours, for instance to engage in care work. Full-time working women who expect no changes in the hourly wage rate when switching to a part-time position have lower incentives to prefer full- over part-time contracts in a given period, thereby explaining the mobility from full- to part-time employment observed in many female labor markets (Apps, Rees, 2005, Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2019). One other interesting insight from this paper is that women’s wage expectations cannot explain why so many women remain in part-time positions over prolonged periods of time. Part-time working women expect wage gains from full-time work - in fact, they even seem to overestimate these gains. Possibly, expected short-run wage gains are too small to alter labor supply choices in comparison to other pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits of part-time employment. In Germany, joint taxation schemes continue to reward, thereby incentivizing, the part-time employment of the secondary earner (Bick, Fuchs-Schündeln, 2017, Steiner, Wrohlich, 2004). Another explanation is that women’s labor supply choices largely reflect (perceived) social norms and constraints related to child care (Boneva, Kaufmann, Rauh, Müller, Wrohlich, 2020). By uncovering women’s beliefs about the relative costs of part-time employment, the results from this paper narrow down the set of potential determinants of women’s labor supply decisions.====This paper also contributes to a large theoretical and empirical literature studying the wage penalty of working part-time (Aaronson, French, 2004, Booth, Wood, 2008, Connolly, Gregory, 2008, Ermisch, Wright, 1993, Hirsch, 2005, Manning, Petrongolo, 2008, Paul, 2016, to cite a few). I review this existing literature in more detail in a separate section of this paper. The main novelty of this paper is to quantify women’s self-beliefs about the respective wage losses and gains of switching between full- and part-time employment.====Finally, this paper also contributes to the growing literature using stated expectations data to overcome the standard identification problem in revealed preference analysis (Manski, 2004, Wiswall, Zafar, 2021, Zafar, 2011). Specifically, the results presented here provide a behavioral foundation for economists modeling female labor supply. Labor supply models require an assumption about the wage-hours locus and there are competing approaches in the literature. Standard discrete choice models in the tradition of Van Soest (1995) impose constant wage offers for full-time and part-time work, implicitly assuming that decision-makers expect constant wages. Others estimate counterfactual part-time and full-time wage offers, hence assuming that expectations about the part-time wage penalty match econometric predictions (Francesconi, 2002, Löffler, Peichl, Siegloch, 2014). So far, the choice between competing models is guided by whether researchers believe a rational agent ==== take into account a part-time wage penalty. However, whether agents ==== expect different wage offers in part-time and in full-time employment is ultimately an empirical question. This paper answers this question for a representative sample of female workers and can serve as a behavioral guideline for researchers striving to capture key features of agents’ decision-processes within economic models of female labor supply.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.

Using data from Household Surveys from 2004 to 2015, and the Specialized Employment Survey 1998–2001, we estimate a series of quasi-experimental difference-in-difference models for permanent and temporary hiring. We evaluate the potential effects of reinstatement rights on the private sector with respect to the non-private sector. We find that reinstatement rights are associated with increases in the hiring of temporary workers and reductions in wages. However, further tests indicate that none of these associations is a causal effect, with a remarkable exception: we find that the right to reinstatement increases private permanent hiring by 2.5 percentage points relative to non-private hiring. These effects hold under a battery of alternative specifications and are robust to placebo tests. Our findings call into question the effectiveness of removing reinstatement laws as a policy to increase permanent hiring and wages.","In 2002, the Peruvian Supreme Court ruled for the right to the reinstatement of workers who were dismissed unfairly. We exploit this ruling as a quasi-experiment to test how employment protection legislation affects labor market outcomes; namely, permanent and temporary hiring, and wages. Our empirical strategy identifies a treatment group of workers who were affected by the ruling, and a control group of workers who were not affected. More specifically, we estimate a difference-in-difference model taking private sector workers as the treatment group and workers outside of the private sector as the control group. We find that the ruling is associated with an increase in permanent hiring of 2.5 percentage points. Furthermore, it is also associated with a relative decrease of temporary hiring in the private sector of 6.8 percentage points. We also find that reinstatement is associated with drops in wages of 1.4 percentage points in the private sector. Nonetheless, except for the increase in permanent private hiring, none of these variations is found to be ==== by reinstatement rights. We verified these lack of causal effects by a battery of robustness checks, placebo test, event studies, and estimations with synthetic controls.====These findings cast serious doubts on the alleged perverse effects of employment protection legislation and, consequently, on removing reinstatement laws as an effective policy tool to improving labor market conditions, as it is proposed in many countries in the world. This is, of course, a very controversial matter. Top firm executives surveyed by the Global Competitive Index (Vera and Rendon, 2021) express their generalized concern about reinstatement laws and employment protection legislation overall. In addition, more comprehensive and representative surveys, like the 2015 National Enterprise Survey (====),==== suggest that reinstatement laws influence permanent hiring patterns for 31% of Peruvian firms.====The economic literature is not consensual regarding the unemployment effects of employment protection legislation. A series of studies finds that employment protection reduces firings at the expense of the perverse effect of lowering employment creation or increasing unemployment (Botero, Djankov, LaPorta, de Silanes, Shleifer, 2004, Heckman, Pagés-Serra, 2000, Lazear, 1990). However, Addison and Grosso (1996) and Kanbur and Ronconi (2018) find that the methods applied in those studies are not sufficiently robust. Moreover, Autor et al. (2006) suggest that the real employment effect of employment protection is lower than it was previously attributed. In the same line, Kugler and Pica (2008) find that a comprehensive labor reform in Italy reduces the probability of becoming employed of between 1 and 2.6 percentage points. Cahuc et al. (2016) also find small employment effects of employment protection for the French labor market, and, instead, a significant substitution of permanent for temporary contracts, who are not entitled to severance payments, are less productive, enjoy less job satisfaction, wages, and human capital accumulation.==== Similarly, Schivardi and Torrini (2008) and Hijzen et al. (2017) find a positive relationship between employment protection and temporary hiring in the Italian labor market. The literature so far seems to conclude that employment protection has small effects on employment,==== but it has substantial effects on increasing temporary hiring at the expense of permanent hiring.====For Peru, Jaramillo (2019) finds large, significant, and persistent drops in formal permanent hiring, real wages and unionization rates after the reestablishment of reinstatement laws. This author gives a causal interpretation to those findings based on comparing formal and informal workers before and after the ruling. In Appendix C, we elaborate on some important threats to the validity of his identification strategy. While attempting to reproduce his results, we do we find a similar decline in formal permanent hiring. Nonetheless, we have to reject interpreting those effects as causal, because formal and informal permanent hiring were already diverging prior to the ruling on reinstatement rights. That is, there is no evidence of common pre-treatment trends between his proposed treatment and control groups. We also show that relaxing this assumption fully erodes the association or changes its sign, under some specifications.====We contribute to the literature as follows. First, we add to previous work related to labor market policy evaluation. This task has proven to be challenging in regions where labor market policy is set at a nationwide level. In particular, because there is no sub-national geographical heterogeneity to exploit à la Card and Krueger (1994). We add to the recent literature in Latin America that resorts to workers outside of the private sector (e.g., public sector workers) as a control group for the private sector (Aguila, 2011, Fernández, Villar, 2017). Moreover, we dedicate Appendix C to discuss the potential pitfalls of recurring to another popular alternative used in the literature. Namely, using informal workers as a control groups for formal workers (Jaramillo, 2019, Kugler, 2004). Our methodological discussion is of general interest as it can be extrapolated to any instance where there is no sub-national treatment intensity heterogeneity within the private sector. We carefully evaluate the likelihood of the identification assumptions, and provide a set of results that relax them. These can be applied in cases when there are valid reasons to doubt their fulfillment.====Second, since Heckman and Pagés-Serra (2000), policy makers and some academics in developing nations have argued that all forms of labor market regulations, such as employment protection legislation, necessarily harm the labor market. Nonetheless, more than 20 years after that book was published, this paper contributes to a more recent literature showing that this is not a straightforward conclusion. For instance, Bergolo and Cruces (2014) show that, in Uruguay, a hike in workers’ payroll contributions enacted to finance an expansion in healthcare coverage, increased labor formality by reshaping individual’s incentives to take up registered employment. Similarly, Magruder (2013) shows that minimum wages can cause a “big push” that increases formal employment and decreases informal employment. Our results are in the same vein. We show that an increase in employment protection increased covered workers’ welfare by augmenting their likelihood of being hired under a permanent contract. We show suggestive evidence that this might have been the result of an increase in workers’ bargaining power.====We submit these results to an extensive battery of robustness checks. First, we perform a series of placebo experiments where we falsify the timing of the treatment. Next, we modify our benchmark specification and estimate an event study design to verify if the timing of the differences between the treatment and control groups coincides with the ruling. Moreover, we relax the parallel trends assumption by modeling flexible group-specific time trends, we select our preferred estimates based on the statistical properties of the observed employment patterns before the treatment. Finally, we provide a data-driven justification for our selection of treatment and control groups via a synthetic control approach. Additionally, in Appendix B we show that our results hold under alternative, but related, definitions for these groups. All of these empirical exercises reinforce our main conclusion: reinstatements seem to have caused an increase in permanent hiring while they had no credible effect on permanent hiring nor wages.====We organize the rest of this document as follows. The next section describes the institutional framework and the legal changes introduced by the Supreme Court’s 2002 ruling regarding job reinstatements. Section 3 describes the data; Section 4 details our identification strategy and Section 5 presents the quasi-experimental design: private vs. other sectors. Section 6 discusses the results and presents several robustness checks. In Section 7, we estimate the wage effects of the ruling.

The method accounts for pipeline effects, non-stationary environments, and dynamic interactions between pay gap components. The decomposition is applied to a new data set covering all employees at the World Bank Group between 1987 and 2015 and shows that historical differences in the positions for which men and women were hired account for 77% of today’s average salary difference, dwarfing the roles of entry salaries, salary growth, or retention differences. Forward simulations show that 20% of the total gap can be assigned to pipeline effects that would resolve mechanically with time.","Aggregate pay gaps (also known as unconditional or raw pay gaps) can serve as holistic measures of gender disparities in pay, and are often quoted in the press.==== Assuming innate differences in productivity and preferences are small across genders, large aggregate pay gaps must reflect discrimination and inefficiency in compensation, in job assignment (hires, promotions, retention) or, upstream, in the production of human capital.====In contrast, legal recourse against sexual discrimination in compensation historically relies on the narrower concept of “Equal Pay for Equal Work” (EPEW), which is concerned with pay gaps between equally productive workers in identical occupations but silent on occupational segregation or inequality in promotions.====Consequently, new transparency regulations are expanding firms’ responsibility beyond EPEW. In the United Kingdom, the “Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017” now requires all firms with 250-plus employees to report the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of all male employees and that of all female employees.====To understand how firms will (or should) respond to these new transparency requirements, we must first understand how aggregate pay gaps arise within a firm. This paper addresses three key considerations that have received little attention in the literature. First, historical patterns in hiring can generate lasting pay gaps long after the original imbalances have disappeared. Consider a firm that satisfies EPEW and applies identical promotion rates to both genders, but hired fewer women than men in the past. Because of “pipeline” effects, it will exhibit an aggregate gender pay gap and an apparent glass ceiling.==== If the role of pipeline effects is mistakenly assigned to other factors, firm policy responses aimed at fixing the pay gap could create further imbalances. Second, existing gender pay gap decompositions assume a constant environment, in the sense that the returns to endowments (aka. the “wage structure”) are time-invariant.==== In fact, we show in our appplication that firm processes, and the gender pay gap itself, can exhibit large fluctuations over time. Third, existing studies tend to examine each firm process separately, even though gender disparities in hires, salary growth and exits interact dynamically.==== As an example, high turnover tends to decrease the quantitative importance of salary growth differences relative to initial salaries differences.====This paper proposes a new dynamic decomposition method that can be applied to aggregate pay gaps to quantify the relative contributions of the gender composition of hires, entry salaries, salary growth, and retention, while accounting for pipeline effects and a changing firm environment.==== The method estimates auxiliary, reduced-form models for each of the decomposition factors in each year, before aggregating them through microsimulations. We then obtain the decomposition through counterfactual simulations of male and female salaries in which each source of pay differences is shut down at a time. The simulations can also be extended forward to quantify pipeline effects. Rather than assume that data are drawn from a steady state, as in traditional wage decomposition methods, our approach accounts for the constant changes in hiring, firing, growth, and shrinkage that are typical in most firms.====To apply our methodology, we assemble a new panel containing 27 years of all personnel records from the World Bank Group (WBG), a multilateral finance organization with more than 16,000 employees in 2015. The panel length, data size, recency, and measurement precision afforded by these personnel records offer the perfect setting for the specific purpose of this paper, which is to analyze the within-firm dynamics of gender pay gaps. The firm is a policy-relevant unit of analysis because firms increasingly bear the legal responsibility of eliminating gender pay gaps. In addition, we show that the size and trends exhibited by gender pay gaps and employment differences in our sample are similar to those found among U.S. employees as a whole.====Our application of the decomposition method to the WBG offers a striking example of how past hiring stocks can affect pay gaps today. Our data show a decline in the aggregate gender gap from 50 cents on the dollar in 1987 to 23 cents on the dollar in 2015. For the mean salaries in our data, this amounts to an annual difference of US$27,400. However, we find that three-quarters of the 2015 gap was due to historical differences in the types of jobs at which women and men were hired. By contrast, less than 10% of the pay gap is due to differences in entry salaries; 5% is due to differences in salary growth (including promotions and raises) and less than 1% is due to differences in retention.====We are also able to quantify how much of the gap will tend to dissipate over time in the absence of any policy or environmental change. When we simulate what would happen to the pay gap if 2015 hiring patterns were kept in place and no changes were made to compensation, we find that over the next 10 years, the aggregate pay gap continues to decline by one fifth (or five percentage points) but then stabilizes. The reason why we see these patterns is that, historically, most hires in technical positions were men; because these hires formed the pipeline for management jobs today, they continue to exert a negative influence on the gender pay gap. By 2015, the bias in hiring among the technical staff had virtually disappeared, which explains our simulated reduction in the pay gap. The persistent residual gap reflects the continued over-representation of women in support staff positions; reducing the gap further requires that men are hired into supporting staff positions as well.====Lastly, we show that the patterns we uncover are not specific to the gender pay gap but also apply to pay gaps associated with employee nationality (broadly categorized in developed versus developing countries). Our methodology could similarly be applied to pay gaps between employees of different races, or disability status, among other examples.====Our main contribution is therefore to propose a simulations-based dynamic decomposition method to understand how gender pay gaps are produced within firms. Studies performing dynamic decompositions based on a fully specified economic model can be found in the literature, applied to different contexts (e.g. Joubert, 2015, Keane, Wolpin, 2010). In contrast to that approach –but in line with classic decomposition methodologies– we do not account for behavioral responses or permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore, our counterfactual simulations should not be interpreted as policy experiments but rather as accounting exercises.====Two non-structural studies share similarities with our approach. Bourguignon et al. (2008) decompose country-level income distribution differences. Although their exercise is static, they also use simulations to aggregate semi-parametric models of each determinant of income dispersion, and generate counterfactual distributions in which the differences in the parameters governing each individual factor are shut down one at a time. Gayle et al. (2012) implement a decomposition that explicitly captures individual career dynamics but the object of their decomposition is the gap in the cumulative earnings of U.S. male and female executives, rather than a cross-sectional firm-level pay gap and hiring pipelines. Also, their approach relies on stationary analytical formulae rather than micro-simulations.====A second contribution of the study is to produce new evidence on the career stages at which pay gaps arise in organizations. The evidence comes from an original panel data set of uncommon length and width, extracted from recent personnel records of the World Bank Group. We show this organization exhibits the classic internal labor market features identified in other large US companies and discussed in Baker and Holmstrom (1995). Existing gender pay gap studies using single-firm data separately document the gender differences in job assignment (Malkiel, Malkiel, 1973, Ransom, Oaxaca, 2005), entry salaries (Gerhart, 1990), salary growth and promotion (Barnet-Verzat, Wolff, 2008, Hersch, Viscusi, 1996, Jones, Makepeace, 1996) and/or retention (Giuliano, Levine, Leonard, Gobillon, Leturcq, Meurs, Roux, 2014, Petersen, Saporta, 2004), but they do not provide, as we do, a quantitative comparison of these gender pay gap sources.====The originality of our approach is to quantify the career stages at which pay gaps arise, rather than to disentangle the contribution of observable worker endowments (such as experience or education) from that of prices as classic regression-based decompositions do. It allows follow-up investigations and remedial efforts to be focused on those organizational processes where the gaps are largest. If, for instance, most of the gender gap arose in entry salaries, a classic Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition could then be applied to entry salaries.==== If instead, salary growth was the main pay gap source, follow-up efforts could investigate gender differences in performance rating, promotions, project allocations, or the impact of career interruptions due to children.",Women in the pipeline: A dynamic decomposition of firm pay gaps,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001725,10 October 2022,2022,Research Article,46.0

Field-specific gender faculty ratios and expected relative salaries as well as economics department rankings are significant factors for gender doctoral specialization dissimilarity. Preferences and characteristics contribute about equally to field specialization dissimilarity.","The distribution of women across academic fields remains uneven. In the economics profession this is uniquely acute as there is a disproportionately lower share of women in the field. This lower share has been stagnant over time not only in the U.S. (Lundberg and Stearns, 2019), but in European academia (Auriol et al., 2019) as well. Our examination of the latest data from the American Economic Association on PhD dissertations indicates that over 40% of women who completed their dissertation in the past decade declared Labor, Health or Microeconomics as their field of specialization. Doctoral dissertation fields for the remaining women were distributed over 17 JEL fields. Among males, the top 3 fields accounting for 40% of specializations were Microeconomics, Macro/Monetary Economics, and Labor. Apart from significant gender differences in some of the other fields, Health and Macro/Monetary stand out because each is in the top 40% for either males or females, but not for both.====The focus of our paper is the process that underlies the choice of field specializations among students in PhD economics programs. These early career choices have implications for gender differences in subsequent career growth and development (Fortin et al., 2021). Our contribution is to understand what is driving gender segregation in fields of economic specialization by examining their doctoral field specialization choices. We investigate whether gender differences in fields are driven by salaries and academic employment prospects, or rather by non-economic factors. In this sense, we extend the literature on decision-making at the graduate school level, which is relatively underdeveloped given the limited data (Altonji et al., 2016).====This research is intended to shed light on the larger issue of gender segregation in the labor market, especially as it applies more broadly to the under-representation of women in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and other highly qualified fields. Economics in itself is a very diverse field with fields of specialization varying along a spectrum from abstract theory to applied empirical economics at the borderline of other fields (e.g. health).====Our research interest is in gender differences in doctoral field specializations in the context of single-primary (one primary field) and dual-primary (two primary fields) specializations. Primary fields are understood here to represent the most aggregated field classifications for analytic purposes. This focus seeks to avoid ambiguity and complexity inherent in higher order multi-field specializations. We adopt an analytic framework for single-primary and dual-primary field specialization choices that includes measures of anticipated salary and academic employment by field. We rely on non-salary data obtained from Academic Analytics and EconLit as well as individual faculty salary data for public colleges and universities available from official state websites.====Our model shows statistically significant gender differences in field choices even after conditioning on personal, economic, and institutional variables. Contrary to expectations, women graduate students are less likely to specialize in Labor/Health, Macro/Finance, IO, Public Economics, or Development/Growth/International and are more likely to specialize in Agricultural/Environmental Economics. Gender disparities in field specializations are far more pronounced when considering both single-primary and dual-primary field specializations than when considering only cases in which graduate students specialize in only one primary field in economics. Our counterfactual analysis shows that differences in preferences and characteristics play a large role in explaining field specialization differences between women and men. If women possessed the male sample characteristics, they would all specialize in Econometrics, Labor/Health and Agricultural/Environmental Economics. If men possessed the characteristics of women, they would not specialize in fields dominant by women and there would be even more men in traditionally male dominant primary fields.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the literature related to research on the lack of diversity and field specialization in economics and studies that examine college major choices, Section 3 describes the data, Section 4 develops the conceptual framework, Section 5 presents the empirical results, Section 6 is a discussion section, and Section 7 presents the summary and conclusions.",Gender differences in economics PhD field specializations with correlated choices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001798,14 November 2022,2022,Research Article,50.0

We identify a causal effect by exploiting quasi-random variation to peers with highly-educated parents across grades within a school. Greater exposure to male high flyers decreases the likelihood that women obtain a bachelor’s degree, lowers their math and science grades, decreases their ==== and increases fertility. They show lower levels of self-confidence/aspirations. The effects are found for girls with below median ability and for those with at least one college-educated parent. There are no effects of high flyers of either gender on boys.","A large literature has documented the importance of peer effects in education. These studies have mostly focused on short-run outcomes and how these are affected by various measures of ==== peer quality. Our paper contributes to the literature by studying long-run educational outcomes by gender for a US representative sample of high-school students. Our analysis generates an important finding: male “high flyers” (the term we use to denote students who have parents with a post college education) have a significant negative effect on the propensity of their high-school female peers to go on to obtain a college degree. We show that these results stem from male high flyers rather than from exposure to boys who on average might be expected to perform better academically. Furthermore, the gender effect is asymmetric: female high flyers do not affect their male peers.====Our investigation focuses on the exposure to high flyers at a particularly impressionable period of life: high school. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) which was designed to be a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7–12 in the US. We make use of a predetermined student characteristic – whether at least one parent has some ==== education – to proxy for a bundle of characteristics that predict that a student will do very well in school. Students with a post-college parent can not only be expected to perform very well academically but may have other important correlated characteristics – e.g., be more career-oriented, have greater self-confidence, possess high expectations of going to college, etc. – that matter to their peers.==== Aggregating this feature across students at the grade level by gender allows us to exploit plausibly exogenous variation across grades within the same school in the proportions of high flyers of each gender.====Our main question of interest is to determine how exposure to high flyers affects long-run human capital. We find a very strong asymmetric gender effect: male high flyers have a statistically and economically significant negative effect on the probability that girls will obtain a bachelor’s degree but do not affect boys. Female high flyers, on the other hand, do not affect college outcomes for either gender. Probing further, we show that the negative effect of male high flyers is concentrated in the lower half of the female ability distribution and among those with more-educated parents. Girls exposed to a higher proportion of male high flyers tend to have lower math and science grades in high school and to substitute away from a four-year college degree into a two-year college degree. Furthermore, they have lower labor force participation and higher fertility by the ages of 26–32. Although our data does not allow us to pin down the precise pathway underlying our results, we are able to go beyond most of the literature and show that a higher proportion of male high flyers is associated with lower self-confidence/aspirations in girls, reminiscent of the asymmetric gender effects from competition found by Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and Bordalo et al. (2019), among others.====Our paper is related to several strands of a literature that study the interaction of peer effects and gender broadly speaking.==== One strand examines how the proportion of own-gender students affects various outcomes (e.g., Anelli, Peri, 2019, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2013, Hoxby, 2000, Lavy, Schlosser, 2011). Another strand studies how ability composition/peer quality affects academic outcomes (e.g., Carrell, Fullerton, West, 2009, Imberman, Kugler, Sacerdote, 2012). There are only a handful of papers that, like ours, are concerned with the potentially asymmetric gender effects from high-performing peers. We discuss these in greater depth below.====Exploiting the shuffling of students between primary and secondary schools in England along with subject-specific differences in peer ability, Lavy et al. (2012) find that high-achieving male peers (those scoring in the top five percent on national standardized tests) have no significant impact on girls’ test scores but negatively impact boys’ scores; high-achieving female peers affect girls’ test scores positively and have no effect on boys’ scores.====Mouganie and Wang (2020) study high-school students in China and find that high-performing male peers (as defined by their national exam scores in mathematics) reduce the likelihood of girls choosing a science track (relative to an arts track) for the remainder of high school; high-performing female peers have the opposite effect. This study differ from ours in various respects. First, their primary focus is on how high-performing peers affect girls’ choice of a STEM track in high school. Although the authors also examine 4-year university eligibility, the data does not permit them to know whether the student actually went on to attend, let alone graduate, from university. Second, high-performing peers of gender ==== in a particular grade are defined as those students of gender ==== who scored above the 20th percentile in the national math exam, ====. This automatically implies that if the proportion of female high-performing peers in the grade is high, the equivalent proportion for males is low as they must add to 100 percent at the grade level. When the authors calculate the proportion of high achievers relative to others of their ==== gender in the grade, as we do, they do not find significant effects for college eligibility.==== The negative results for girls choosing STEM in high school from high-achieving males remains as does the positive effect of high-achieving females, however. Lastly, the institutional setting is very different and both are of great interest in their own right.====Feld and Zölitz (2022) exploit the random assignment of first-year students within compulsory courses to teaching sections in a Dutch business school. Conducting a careful statistical analysis, they show that belonging to a teaching section in which either female or male peers have a higher ==== pre-assignment GPA (grades obtained in business school prior to joining the teaching section) does not have a significant effect neither for a student’s choice of mathematical elective courses nor for the selection of a mathematical major. The authors also study outcomes five years later and do not find any effects of higher GPA female or male peers on employment or earnings. Relative to this paper, our contribution is to study outcomes in a less specialized environment than a business school and to do so for a representative sample of US high schools.====Our paper, along with the ones cited above, have influenced other recent papers to examine asymmetric gender effects. For example, Busso and Frisancho (2021) study how exposure to high-performing male and female peers in public middle schools in Mexico City affect high-school placement outcomes, disentangling between two factors that affect placement: exam performance and how the student orders school preference. They find that high-achieving boys have strong negative effects on high-performing girls’ admission scores and preferences for selective schools. Balestra et al. (2021) study the causal impact of intellectually gifted students on their non-gifted classmates in grades 7 and 8 in Switzerland. They find that male students benefit from gifted peers, regardless of their gender whereas female students benefit almost exclusively from gifted female students, particularly in math. They also study longer term outcomes, finding that exposure to gifted classmates significantly increases the likelihood of male students entering the academic track instead of the vocational one, increasing the likelihood that these men go on to choose a STEM occupation. Lastly, Modena et al. (2022) study exposure to high-performing peers across cohorts within the same degree and university in Italy. They find that all students, although especially girls, benefit from female high-performing peers. Male high performers have negative effects on female students (and smaller but still negative effects on male students), particularly in STEM degree programs.====Our paper is also related to those that study the long-run impacts of peers’ parental education. Bifulco et al. (2011) and Bifulco et al. (2014) use Add Health and find that peer socioeconomic status, as measured by percentage of students whose mother completed college, improves high-school completion and college attendance but has no effect on bachelor’s degree attainment. We show that these results stem, however, from not differentiating between male and female peers with college-educated mothers and from not allowing the effect of these peers to differ by the gender of the student (see Table 10). Furthermore, in a horse race between using college-education (now differentiated by gender) and our high flyer measure, we show that only the latter affects long-run education outcomes.====Overall, the contribution of our paper lies in the importance of the setting, which is representative of the high-school population in the US, in its focus on longer-run outcomes (college graduation chiefly but also marriage and fertility), in the distinction made between high-average peers versus high flyer peers, and its exploration of channels such as aspirations and heterogeneous effects.====Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data and sample selection. Section 3 presents the empirical model and identification strategy. Section 4 is devoted to the main regression analysis. Section 5 explores robustness and addresses potential concerns. Section 6 examines heterogeneity in the results and Section 7 explores potential mechanisms and studies other long-run outcomes.

High levels of inequality are not only incompatible with widely held norms of social justice, they can also fuel social tensions and might pose a threat to economic growth. Not surprisingly, the drivers of wage inequality and possible remedies have become some of the most hotly debated issues by policymakers and researchers alike.====In this paper, we investigate the role of occupational tasks in driving male wage inequality in West Germany.==== A distinctive feature of our paper is the use of administrative wage data matched with task data from employee surveys which capture changes in task content within occupations. Economists have long recognised the importance of human capital in explaining workers’ wage differentials (Becker, 1962, Mincer, 1974). In the early 2000s, researchers proposed a new approach to measuring human capital using data on tasks performed on the job (Autor et al., 2003). This task-based approach defines occupations as bundles of tasks and links workers’ wages to occupational tasks. The main hypothesis is that recent technological change is biased toward replacing labour in routine tasks, leading to a decrease in wages and employment shares in routine-task intensive occupations.====Several studies have drawn on this hypothesis to explain the polarisation of the US labour market since the late 1990s (e.g. Autor, Dorn, 2013, Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2006, Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008). Some researchers argue that the routinisation hypothesis also (partly) explains polarisation tendencies in Western European countries, most notably in Germany and in the UK (e.g. Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009, Goos, Manning, 2007, Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2009, Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). Contributions in this field focus on employment or wage polarisation, or both. The term employment polarisation describes the phenomenon that the employment shares of high- and low-skill occupations have been increasing at the expense of employment shares in middle-skill occupations. In the same vein, wage polarisation means that wages at the top and the bottom have been increasing faster than those in the middle of the distribution. In other words, the pay difference between high-wage and middle-wage jobs has increased, while the difference between middle- and lower-wages has been shrinking. In this paper, we focus on wage polarisation.====The majority of studies investigating the routinisation hypothesis suffer from several shortcomings. First, most are of a descriptive nature: They simply document changes in wage and employment patterns of occupations and juxtapose them to the routine-task intensity of those occupations. Second, most are silent on whether tasks ==== occupations have changed.==== Third, most studies lack a discussion on how to measure routine tasks. However, such a discussion is nontrivial and wrong classifications may lead to wrong conclusions (Autor, 2013).====In this paper, we try to overcome these shortcomings. First, we apply a rigorous econometric framework and move beyond merely comparing patterns. Specifically, we use a two-stage decomposition procedure introduced by Firpo et al. (2009), which allows for (i) accounting of multiple explanatory factors in a regression framework, and (ii) investigating changes along the entire wage distribution. The approach is similar to the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition (Blinder, 1973, Oaxaca, 1973) in that it decomposes wage differentials in a counterfactual manner. However, it is more flexible, allowing for the decomposition of any distributional statistic. We may thus uncover important differences at different parts of the distribution, which the mean analysis of the OB decomposition would overlook. Second, we account explicitly for changes in task content within occupations. Third, we introduce a new classification of tasks, focusing the discussion on how to identify routine tasks.====Our task data are the BIBB/IAB and BIBB/BAuA Employment Surveys, representative cross-section surveys conducted roughly every seven years since 1979. For each survey wave, we can directly measure the task content of occupations; that is, survey participants indicate the activities they perform on the job. We characterise occupational tasks by four categories: abstract (such as researching), interactive (such as negotiating), manual (such as repairing) and routine (such as operating machinery). We aggregate this worker-level data into occupational cells and use the occupational code to match our task data to our wage data, which is the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB). The SIAB is a 2% random sample of all social security records in Germany, covering the employment histories of about 1.5 million individuals from 1975 through 2008.====We provide descriptive evidence that the task content within occupations varies over time. This evidence provides support for Autor's (2013) assessment that new technologies have not simply wiped out certain occupations, but fundamentally changed the tasks performed in these occupations. Generally, we find that the shares of routine and manual tasks decrease over time, while the shares of abstract and interactive tasks increase. This trend holds across wage deciles, while its magnitude differs at different parts of the distribution. We thus speak to the recent literature investigating ====-occupation task changes in the US labour market (Atalay, Phongthiengtham, Sotelo, Tannenbaum, 2018, Atalay et al., 2019, Atalay, Phongthiengtham, Sotelo, Tannenbaum, 2020, Deming, Kahn, 2018, Hershbein, Kahn, 2018, Michaels, Rauch, Redding, 2019). In a departure from prior research, we find that the share of routine tasks is largest in occupations at the lowest tail of the wage distribution and that this share slowly declines with increasing wage. We can thus not confirm that occupations in the middle of the wage distribution have the largest routine-task intensity.====Related to this point, we show descriptively that changes in the West German wage structure are different to those observed in Anglo-Saxon countries. Instead of a U-shaped polarisation of wages since the early 1980s (Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008, Goos, Manning, 2007), we find a uniform increase in wage inequality with widening wage gaps at the top starting in the early 1980s, and at the bottom starting only in the 1990s. Our findings are in line with studies for West Germany that use register data (Antonczyk, DeLeire, Fitzenberger, 2018, Baumgarten, Felbermayr, Lehwald, 2020, Biewen, Fitzenberger, De Lazzer, 2017, Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009, Dustmann, Fitzenberger, Schönberg, Spitz-Oener, 2014, Fitzenberger, 1999, Kohn, 2006, Riphahn, Schnitzlein, 2016). Changes in the wage structure are thus concentrated both at the top and the bottom, while the middle remains relatively stable.====Our decomposition analyses reveal several additional findings. First, we find composition effects, i.e. changes due to varying worker characteristics, not to matter much. This result somewhat contradicts previous studies (Antonczyk, Fitzenberger, Leuschner, 2009, Biewen, Fitzenberger, De Lazzer, 2017, Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009), which point toward composition effects explaining some of the inequality increase. However, those studies use either different data or look at different time horizons compared to us, which may explain the differing findings. Contrarily, using the Integrated Employment Biographies, which contains nearly all private sector employees in Germany, Card et al. (2013) also find that compositional effects do not matter greatly.====Second, we find wage structure effects, i.e. changes in the returns to those characteristics, to be important drivers of wage inequality. Specifically, from the late 1970s until the early 1990s, we identify changes in the returns to education and experience as major drivers of wage inequality. Occupational tasks start to matter in the 1990s only. For that period, we find changing returns to abstract tasks to drive upper-tail inequality. Technological change may have increased the demand for and thus the returns to abstract tasks. An example could be advancements in communication technology that benefit workers in occupations with large shares of abstract tasks. This assessment is in line with Dustmann et al. (2009), who argue that technological change is an important driver for upper-tail wage inequality.====For lower-tail inequality, we find changing returns to routine tasks as a major driver. The intuition here is that workers at the bottom of the wage distribution have a comparative advantage in occupations that are intensive in routine tasks, while the demand for these tasks has declined. This result differs from earlier work focusing on labour markets where occupations in the middle of the distribution are characterised by high routine intensity. This difference may be the result of our more rigorous definition of routine tasks. For example, Katz (2014) highlights for the US that many crafts occupations that are commonly classified as routine manual have been faring well in terms of labour market performance. This could point to an inappropriate classification of routine manual tasks.====In the 2000s, we find abstract and routine tasks not to matter greatly anymore, while changing returns to interactive tasks are now driving lower-tail inequality. This finding could be related to previous empirical findings that some tasks are not easily offshored and thus less affected by decreasing wages (Autor, Dorn, 2013, Firpo, Fortin, Lemieux, 2011). Occupations with large shares of ‘non-offshorable’ tasks may thus have experienced an increasing demand and thus increasing returns during the 2000s. Our results also speak to the relatively few studies that focus on the rising complementarity between cognitive and social skills (Borghans, Ter Weel, Weinberg, 2014, Deming, 2017, Weinberger, 2014).====Furthermore, in the 2000s, we find a role for firm characteristics to explain increases in lower-tail wage inequality. We thus confirm previous findings, which point to the importance of firm heterogeneity in explaining increases in inequality (Antonczyk, Fitzenberger, Sommerfeld, 2010, Card, Heining, Kline, 2013, Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009).====Our study is closest to Antonczyk et al. (2009), who also run a decomposition analysis for Germany. However, our study differs in several important aspects. First, they use the classification of tasks introduced by Spitz-Oener (2006), while we develop a new task categorisation. Second, they investigate the years 1999 to 2006, while our time horizon spans from 1978 to 2006. This longer horizon provides the opportunity for a detailed analysis of task changes within occupations. Third, they solely rely on survey data, while we use wage register data.====Our study adds several new insights to the discussion on the drivers of wage inequality. First, we show how the time-varying characteristics of occupations matter. Any discussion on how technological change affects the nature of work should thus explicitly account for changing task requirements within occupations. Second, we show that a simple comparison of wage and task patterns may lead to wrong conclusions. For example, in the early 2000s increases in upper-tail wage inequality coincide with increases in the share of abstract tasks. However, our RIF regression-based decompositions reveal that these patterns are largely unrelated. Only a regression framework allows controlling for confounding factors and uncovering the contribution of changes in occupational tasks to changes in the wage distribution.====Our study thus allows for a better understanding of why some occupations have incurred sharp wage losses, while others have experienced strong gains. Such an understanding is also important for the policy debate on whether workers today are well equipped to face the challenges arising from technological change and on whether education curricula may need to be revised.",Occupational tasks and wage inequality in West Germany: A decomposition analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001749,14 October 2022,2022,Research Article,52.0

Despite anti-discrimination laws and gender quotas, men still hold the majority of leadership positions, even in professions where gender ratios among graduates are balanced (see e.g. Chamberlain, Jayaraman, 2017, Monroe, Chiu, 2010). It is unclear to what extent social and biological factors can explain these differences (Browne, 2006). The crude gender wage gap in the EU of 16.6% reduces considerably when accounting for relevant explanatory factors such as qualification, tasks, and working biography; 11.5% still remain unexplained (Eurostat, 2018). Even considering occupational choices and career paths expectations cannot fully explain the gap (Chevalier, 2007). Evolutionary differences in intergroup rivalries could lead to gender-specific competitive behavior (Vugt et al., 2007).====Personality and competitive behavior determine how people negotiate. Due to differences in social roles and role congruity, men perform slightly better in negotiations (Stuhlmacher, Linnabery, 2013, Stuhlmacher, Walters, 1999). Recent studies document lower female willingness to enter bargaining and worse outcomes. Women accept lower initial wages due to reduced self-perception (Dittrich et al., 2014) and lack of social information (Rigdon, 2012). They are less likely to sort into companies paying higher premiums and only receive 90% of their male colleagues’ premium (Card et al., 2016). Men prefer negotiable wages (Leibbrandt and List, 2015). Environment and framing are relevant for competitive behavior, e.g. for women, the gender of the counterpart significantly affects the willingness to initiate negotiations (Eriksson and Sandberg, 2012). When framed as an opportunity to ask rather than to negotiate, gender differences disappear (Small et al., 2007).====To better understand where these differences in negotiations come from, the literature analyzes gender-specific competitiveness in experiments. Three potential explanations for the persisting gender gaps exist. First, men are more prone to select into competitive environments (Dohmen, Falk, 2011, Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007). Second, men are less risk-averse (Croson and Gneezy, 2009) and rather overconfident (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007). Third, women perform worse when competing against men (Gneezy et al., 2003) although this seems to depend on stakes and age (Antonovics et al., 2009).====Evidence from sports complements the experimental insights. Three factors seem to be important for high performers: risk behavior, environment, and stakes. First, men take more risks both when risky behavior might pay off (Böheim et al., 2016) and when it does not (Gerdes and Gränsmark, 2010). Second, women perform better in a female environment (Booth and Yamamura, 2018). Third, men choke under pressure (Cohen-Zada et al., 2017).====While the literature building on data from professional sports provides substantial insights, there are three drawbacks. First, male and female competitive behavior are rarely directly comparable. Nearly all professional sports are gender-separated. Hence, men and women face different environments and incentives (with some exceptions, e.g. Japanese speedboat racing in Booth and Yamamura, 2018, and chess in Gerdes and Gränsmark, 2010). To analyze whether there are systematic differences in competitive behavior between men and women, it is crucial to observe both genders in exactly the same environment competing against each other.====Second, professional sports are extremely selective and representative only for top performers who sacrifice years of training before gaining ground in tournaments with high monetary rewards. This selection is especially important when analyzing gender differences because the distributions of “taste for competition” for men and women might be different (e.g. in terms of standard deviations). Self-selection into professional sports limits the extrapolation of results to the whole working population. To circumvent this problem, one would need to look at an environment which is representative for a larger share of the population in terms of ability and taste for competition, for example at non-professional sports without monetary rewards. Non-professional sports draw from a larger distribution both in terms of athletic potential and taste for competition because the barriers to enter the sport are low. While there is certainly some selection bias, it should be much lower than in professional sports.====Third, winning in professional sports is tied to high monetary rewards which incentivize men and women differently. Several studies document that gender differences in competitiveness vary across stakes (Antonovics, Arcidiacono, Walsh, 2009, Ors, Palomino, Peyrache, 2013). High stake situations are rare events, e.g. promotions and wage negotiations. Low stake situations occur frequently, e.g. whenever employees decide how much effort to put into a task. A single task alone is not relevant for promotion or wage decisions but the sum of those tasks shapes the supervisor’s perception of the employee. Additionally, looking at a low stake environment comes closer to the “intrinsic” motivation to win a competition, which is still not entirely understood.====In a previous paper, we analyzed gender differences in competitive behavior in a non-professional sport with direct gender competition: ninepin bowling (Pikos and Straub, 2020). Using data from around 11,000 games from the German region Württemberg, we found that while men perform better against women on average, this is fully explained by differences in ability. Instrumenting for opposite gender using the sex composition of the opponent team, we did not find any evidence for a significant causal effect of competing against the opposite gender on performance. There were also no significant gender differences in tight situations where the pressure to perform is higher.====In the present paper, we analyze the role culture and age play for gender-specific performance in competing against the opposite sex. Previous studies find that boys and girls differ in their competitive behavior in Israel but not in Sweden (Dreber, von Essen, Ranehill, 2011, Gneezy, Rustichini, 2004). Differences in competing against the opposite sex could be country specific. Our German data does not contain information on age but the sport is played by young and old, while studies using data from professional sports are often restricted to very homogeneous groups (professional athletes). This is problematic considering that some aspects of personality develop during adolescence (e.g. Fehr et al., 2013, for distributional preferences) and are stable over the working life (e.g. Cobb-Clark and Schurer, 2012, for BIG-5 personality traits). So far, we have only limited knowledge about the heterogeneity of gender-specific competitive behavior. Although previous studies suggest that it varies over age, evidence for whether the gender gap in competition is stable across the life cycle is mixed. Flory et al. (2015) conduct a field experiment with 18- to 68-year-olds and find a smaller gender gap in competitiveness for older age cohorts (Flory et al., 2018 confirm this with experiments in Malawi and the U.S. showing that elderly women have the same taste for competition as men). In contrast to that, Mayr et al. (2012) document that the gender gap does not vary over age in their laboratory experiment with 25- to 75-year-olds. Czibor et al. (2019) show that women are more risk averse in a traditionally male environment of online card players and do not find significant age effects in a subsample analysis.====To contribute to this literature, we use around 585,000 observations from twelve seasons of ninepin bowling. Our data comes from the Czech Republic and Austria and contains information on 8,700 players’ gender and age and their performance in nearly 23,000 games. Controlling for ability, we find that men perform better against women and women worse against men in the Czech Republic but not in Austria. This is stable across age.

Exploiting a natural experiment, this paper estimates how being infected with the virus shapes individual-level productivity after having recovered. Studying the performance of professional athletes in Germany and Italy and applying a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that individual performance drops by around 6 percent after a previously infected athlete returns to the pitch. This striking deterioration remains persistent over time – amounting to 5% eight months after the infection. The effect increases with age and infection severity, and is spread disproportionally over the course of a match. We detect no productivity effects for other respiratory infections. We take these findings as first evidence that the pandemic might cause long-lasting effects on worker productivity and economic growth.","To counteract the spread of COVID-19, governments have introduced a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as distancing rules or work-from-home directives. Though indispensable from an epidemiologist’s perspective, measures such as the closing of schools and universities and the general reduction in economic activity has come with high direct and indirect costs for society as early economic evaluations emphasize (see, for example, the review articles by ====, ====) To date, most of this research has primarily considered the costs of NPIs. Besides the obvious effect of fewer infections and deaths in total, research quantifying the individual and economic benefits of infection prevention is hitherto missing. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by documenting the significant and persistent effect of a COVID-19 infection on individual labor productivity.====We contribute these novel findings by studying the performance of professional soccer players after a COVID-19 infection – a setting unrivaled in data quality: We use a highly granular nested panel data set that encompasses a sub-panel for every single match for nearly two years in the top-tier male soccer leagues of Germany and Italy. Thereby we take advantage of an institutional setting that is unique across occupations not only in terms of data availability. First, professional soccer is an ==== that quickly resumed business, mostly unaffected by NPIs, after only a short interruption in spring 2020 – differently from many other industries. Second, the top European leagues implemented a uniquely rigorous testing procedure: Every player was PCR-tested at least once per week and often several times.====Our findings hardly suffer from measurement errors caused by unknown positives. Thus, we circumvent the issue of true case numbers being much higher than reported ones – a problem most occupations face (====, ====). Hence, we are actually able to estimate a population effect and not only the impact of COVID-19 of those showing up in a hospital. Given the popularity of the sport, we can exploit extremely detailed records of all players in every match. This allows us to disentangle individual and team productivity and to detect short- and long-run effects which would remain unobserved outside this industry. Eventually, medical studies on ‘long COVID’ are subject to methodological problems due to a reliance on patients’ self-reported health or subsamples with strong symptoms (====, ====). By solely considering observational data, we avoid this issue.====To estimate the effects of a COVID-19 infection, we apply a staggered difference-in-differences framework. We compare infected with non-infected players before and after the infection and exploit the arguably idiosyncratic timing of infections with the virus for identification. In the context of our analysis, we consider productivity as a function of various individual health aspects, such as acceleration, condition, and endurance, but also cognitive capability. Our empirical analysis addresses two questions: Does a COVID-19 infection affect the probability of a player participating in a match and the length of time he stays on the pitch? This extensive margin captures general absence effects related to the infection but also takes up the non-consideration of post-infected players by the team managers. Second, is the performance of previously infected players lower once they play again? Here, our interest lies in productivity across matches as well as within a match – the intensive margin effects.====At the extensive margin, we find that once players are cleared to play by a team’s medical staff, their time on the pitch decreases by more than 5%. At the intensive margin, we are able to identify a significant deterioration in infected players’ productivity of 5–7% after an infection. This effect becomes visible right after a player’s return to the pitch but remains persistent for more than eight months – a notable difference from what we find for common respiratory infections.====Exploiting the very rich nature of our data, we further assess players’ performance throughout every single match. We identify a disproportional decrease in productivity toward the end of a game. This pattern might even be underestimated as the weakest players are likely to be substituted off. Our analysis reveals notable heterogeneity across age groups. Players above the age of 30 are twice as severely hit as players aged 26 to 30. For younger players up to 25 years of age there exists no significant effect at all.====Our paper also contributes to the strand of research which addresses differences between COVID-19 infections and other respiratory infections. For example, ==== approximate the costs of continuing health deterioration to amount up to 30% of the overall costs caused by the disease including fatalities. In our setting, we highlight that an infection with COVID-19 is indeed different from other respiratory infections, because a productivity deterioration of around 5.1% persists over the course of more than eight months. In contrast, we do not find productivity effects originating from colds and similar illnesses.====As in many industries, soccer is a team production. Therefore, we investigate how the individual performance deterioration affects the overall group outcome. A priori, it is unclear whether non-infected players might overcompensate the weakness of their colleagues or suffer from lower performance as well. Our findings support the latter. Players’ joint performance tends to be even lower than the accumulated individual deterioration of infected team members.====Of particular interest for this paper is research on productivity effects during the pandemic. For example, ==== has shown that low-productivity firms in particular have drawn from public subsidy schemes. Regarding working from home, the findings for productivity are mixed. While ==== find an overall positive effect on worker productivity in the UK, ==== do not find significant differences for the UK, ==== identifies a decline for the Japanese economy. Using chess tournaments, ==== identify a deterioration for cognitively demanding tasks.==== find that online learners during COVID-19 shutdowns have significantly worse outcomes compared to fellow students in classrooms. Particularly among academics, ==== find that womens’ productivity was much more affected through the channel of lockdowns and the related burdens of childcare. In a broader sense, ====, ==== show that workers have been unequally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to different possibilities to move their work to their homes. In contrast to those and many other economic papers, our primary focus lies on the ==== effect of an infection itself on individual productivity and not indirect channels such as NPIs, which are exploited above.====, ====, ====), identifying psychological drivers of cognitive performance (e.g., ====, ====), or deriving conclusions for public and labor economics (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.

This study examines how workers decide whether or not to pursue tech, through an experiment in which subjects are offered a short programming job. Despite the persistent gender gap in computer science fields, female subjects in this incentivized experiment are equally confident and willing to program. The most important determinants of the “reservation wage” for workers to do computer programming are whether they enjoy it and their opportunity cost of time. Two treatments were introduced to increase confidence. Randomly assigned extra information about the programming task has no effect. In some circumstances, an encouraging message raises the reservation wage for programming. (JEL codes: C91, J24, J22).","Salaries for workers with in-demand technology skills are high.==== Increasing the pool of workers who have these skills and apply for tech jobs would increase economic productivity in the US and throughout the world. Policy discussions about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or computer skill training emphasize the social benefit of a high-skill work force. Often an assumption is made that, if more people had access to training, more people would go into tech careers, especially since wages are high. However, self-selection into tech jobs is not well understood. The number of American college students who choose to major in computer science is increasing, but it remains a small fraction.====The majority of American college students are not pursuing tech careers but rather favor traditional tracks such as business and nursing. It is important to determine the reasons why most students and job seekers do not consider tech jobs nor pursue opportunities in the dynamic technology sector. One possible factor is the perception of the specific work tasks. Do people dislike computer programming, or do they lack confidence in their own ability to do technical tasks? This paper describes the first controlled study of what factors affect the decision to do computer programming jobs. The majority of the participants are college students who are considering their future career.====The experiment is designed to isolate willingness to do the technical tasks involved in high-skill computer work.==== Specifically, we ask subjects if they will spend time learning and doing paid computer programming. They must pass a quiz on the function of basic commands in order to qualify for most of the payment. A control for the opportunity cost of time focuses the results on whether participants want to program or not. We abstract away from other concerns that a prospective tech worker has, such as whether they will be able to obtain a job offer, to isolate the perception of the technical tasks. Every participant is offered the tech “job” and they perform the task by themselves, so we have a unique opportunity to study the labor supply for technical work removed from concerns about competition or harassment in a team. By asking a narrow question, we hope to gain insights into job selection. However, we acknowledge that some aspects of actual tech employment are not captured in our experiment. Female subjects behave in the same way as males for incentivized portions of the experiment. However, their self-reported survey answers indicate that the gender gap in tech may be due to more than just a preference for the tasks involved. For example, female subjects are more likely to state that they expect to experience harassment if they pursue tech jobs outside of the experiment.==== This experimental design can be extended in the future to explore the causes of the gender gap in tech companies.====Most participants want to do the training and short job. However, some require a high wage and several refuse entirely. The variation in willingness to accept this job and the implied reservation wages in this experiment can help explain trends in tech employment.==== The most important factor in their decision is whether they report that they enjoy programming or not. People who do not enjoy programming require more money to do it. We can show that this is not simply due to having a higher opportunity cost of time, since the experiment also measures the reservation wage for participants to do a simple task that takes the same amount of time as the programming task. Having previous training in programming has very little effect on willingness to train and take the job.====Several treatment interventions were implemented with the goal of increasing confidence. Subjects do not appear more confident if they get to preview a programming code challenge. An encouraging message stating the fact that other students with no experience had been able to succeed in the training caused subjects to raise their reservation wage to program, which is the opposite of the intended effect. Although there is some evidence in the literature that the right kind of encouragement increases the tech labor supply, this experiment serves as a warning about one-size-fits-all messages to students.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature on selection into tech work and gender differences. Section 3 describes the design of the experiment used to capture willingness to program in a controlled environment. We present hypotheses in Section 4 and results in Section 5.

Special survey questions in the Job Search Supplement of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) allow us to elicit information about individuals’ desired work hours for the 2013–2021 period. Using these questions, along with workers’ actual labor market participation, we construct a labor market underutilization measure, the Aggregate Hours Gap (AHG), following Faberman et al. (2020). The AHG captures changes in labor market underutilization for the full population along both the extensive and intensive margins using data on desired work hours as a measure of their potential labor supply. We find that a sharp increase in the AHG during the Covid pandemic essentially disappeared by the end of 2021. We also document a sharp decline in desired work hours during the pandemic that persists through the end of 2021 and is roughly double the drop in the labor force participation rate. Ignoring the decline in desired hours overstates the degree of underutilization by 2.5 percentage points (12.5%). Our findings suggest that, through 2021Q4, the labor market was tighter than suggested by the unemployment rate and the adverse ==== of the pandemic was more pronounced than implied by the labor force participation rate. These discrepancies underscore the importance of taking into account the intensive margin for both labor market underutilization and potential labor supply.","The Covid pandemic has had a devastating effect on labor markets in the U.S. and throughout the world. Payroll employment in the U.S. fell by as much as 16 percent and remained over 2 percent below its February 2020 level at the end of 2021. The unemployment rate more than quadrupled, rising from 3.5 percent in February 2020 to a peak of 14.7 percent, and was at 3.9 percent at the end of 2021. Several studies, as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, who publish the unemployment rate), have pointed out that even this large spike in the unemployment rate likely understates the degree of labor market slack present during this period.==== Moreover, despite a rapid decline in the unemployment rate and relatively strong employment growth since the initial aggregate shock, the labor force participation rate remains persistently low. Economists and the popular press have suggested a broad range of potential causes. These include lagging cyclical adjustment of labor force participation, added child care burdens among women, generous unemployment benefits and other fiscal stimulus programs, fear of returning to work while the virus persists, and structural changes in how individuals view work.====The key to our analysis is the Job Search Supplement of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE). We designed this survey in 2013 and have administered it through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York annually each October since then (see Faberman et al. (2022), for details). The supplement asks a wide range of questions on an individual’s employment situation, work preferences, and job search behavior. We focus on questions in the supplement that ask respondents about the number of hours they desire to work and their reservation wage. These measures allow us to identify changes in willingness to work over time. Furthermore, the 2020 and 2021 SCE Job Search Supplements include new questions on how the pandemic has affected individual job search and labor market participation decisions. Thus, using the SCE for our analysis provides two major advantages. First, unlike traditional surveys, it explicitly asks respondents about their potential labor supply and reservation wages; and second, unlike newer surveys developed during the pandemic, it provides a benchmark period that allows a comparison with the pre-pandemic labor market.====Desired labor supply combined with actual hours worked also provides an intuitive measure of labor market underutilization. We refer to this broader underutilization measure as the ==== (AHG) following Faberman et al. (2020, henceforth FMST). The AHG measures underutilization through the difference between individuals’ ==== and ====, regardless of labor force status. FMST (2020) show that the SCE measure of desired hours is strongly related to job search effort and is a good indicator of ====. They also show that the AHG captures aspects of labor market slack missed by traditional measures, like the unemployment rate, and generally has a stronger relationship with nominal wage growth. Given that it encapsulates a broad concept of labor market underutilization, the AHG is well-suited to deal with the unique labor market circumstances of the Covid pandemic. This includes the misclassification of those on furlough or temporary layoff and any reduction in labor supply and work hours for reasons specific to the Covid pandemic and its related lockdown orders.====In this paper, we use the SCE data along with the AHG measure to evaluate and corroborate the impact of the pandemic on labor market underutilization and aggregate labor supply. We find a diverging pattern between the AHG and the unemployment rate. The AHG suggests that the labor market is ==== than what the unemployment rate suggests during the Covid pandemic, with the AHG already below its February 2020 level by the end of 2021. We find that this is driven primarily by individuals out of the labor force (and partly by part-time workers). During the pandemic, these individuals report lower desired work hours, and consequently a lower willingness to participate in the labor market even marginally. Quantitatively, we find that the decline in desired work hours across all individuals is 4.6 percent, compared to a decline in the labor force participation rate of 2.3 percent, over this period. The decline occurs with a sharp drop at the onset of the pandemic that remains persistently low thereafter. Further analysis of the decline in the AHG and desired hours shows that a higher share of the employed are essentially on their labor supply curve (in the sense that their actual hours equal their desired hours) and a higher share of those out of the labor force that are unwilling to work at all drive the observed aggregate patterns. Following the Great Recession, the pattern was different. The AHG showed a more sluggish labor market recovery, and therefore a higher degree of labor market underutilization, driven primarily by individuals out of the labor force who were willing to work a small amount of hours but were slow to find work. We refer to these driving force as the ====.====To quantify the role of the reduction in labor supply on labor market underutilization, we perform a counterfactual exercise that holds desired work hours constant at their pre-pandemic average within detailed labor force and demographic groups and recalculates the AHG and associated potential work hours from March 2020 forward. The exercise suggests that the decline in desired work hours reduced the AHG by 2.5 percentage points (12.5 percent) relative to its estimated value at the end of 2021. It also suggests that essentially all of the discrepancy between the fall in potential work hours and the labor force participation rate is accounted for by the decline in desired hours during the pandemic (as opposed to changes in composition). Again, changes in the desired hours of those out of the labor force and part-time workers account for most of the differences identified in the counterfactual exercise. Notably, we find only mild differences by gender in their declines in desired hours—i.e., the result is not driven by a contraction in labor supply among women, which resonates with the findings of Hobijn and Şahin (2021). Instead, we find the drop in desired hours is pervasive across most demographic groups, with those with less than a college degree having a notably larger contribution.====Finally, we examine a range of suggestive evidence on the extent that the Covid pandemic had a direct role on the observed reduction on labor supply. First, we group individuals based on the degree of social contact required of their current or most recent job, with a higher degree of social contact implying a higher potential exposure to Covid. We find that individuals in jobs with at least a moderate degree of social contact had sizable reductions in their desired work hours during the pandemic, while those in jobs with a low degree of social contact actually increased their desired work hours. Second, we find that real reservation wages increased during the pandemic for nearly all labor force and demographic groups, consistent with a decline in willingness to work. Real reservation wages increased 6 log points (6.2 percent), on average, across all individuals. The increase is robust to controls for observable characteristics. Third, using the responses to special Covid-specific questions in the CPS and SCE, we find that the pandemic caused a sizeable reduction in job search behavior for most of 2020, but that its effect on job search had mostly subsided by the end of 2021. In fact, we find that job search effort (in terms of job applications sent and the incidence of on-the-job search) rebounded strongly in 2021.====Our study follows an expansive set of empirical studies on the effects of the Covid pandemic on the labor market. Many of these studies focus on the initial shock to the labor market at the onset of the pandemic, while others evaluate the effects of government policies, such as the expansion of unemployment insurance, on labor supply and employment.==== Most relevant to our research are several studies that find labor market tightness was greater than what standard measures implied because of a reduction in job search effort in the early portion of the pandemic. These include studies by Forsythe et al. (2020), Marinescu, Skandalis, and Zhao (2020), Brinca, Duarte, and Faria-e-Castro (2021), and Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, and Rathelot (2021). These studies identify a reduction in job search effort, either directly or indirectly, as a contributor to labor market tightness across multiple countries. Our findings are consistent with recent work, such as Domash and Summers (2022) and Crump et al. (2022), that argue that the U.S. labor market at the end of 2021 is tighter than in 2019 using alternative measures of labor market tightness. Our study is also related to research on a declining trend in the willingness to work that predates the pandemic (Barnichon and Figura, 2016). Finally, our study dovetails with academic research (e.g., Bick and Blandin, 2020) and government initiatives, such as the U.S. Household Pulse Survey, that developed special surveys and survey instruments to study the Covid pandemic.====The next section describes the conceptual underpinnings of the AHG. Section 3 describes our data and methodology for estimating the AHG and its components. Section 4 presents the aggregate time-series behavior of the AHG and its components. Section 5 quantifies the role of labor supply for the reduction in the AHG and provides supporting evidence on the role of the Covid pandemic for labor supply and job search.

Finding the right redistributive policy to counteract this is challenging. Governments largely focus on individuals—not families—attempting to bring about social change by taxing one group (the advantaged) and transferring to another (the disadvantaged). However, “there is little support for the claim that untargeted income transfer policies to poor families significantly boost child outcomes” (Heckman and Mosso, 2014, p. 2). Moving beyond standard tax-and-transfer programs to find new approaches to supporting disadvantaged families requires that we better understand the mechanisms underpinning intergenerational persistence in social and economic welfare (see Corak, 2006; Black and Devereux, 2011).====We examine the degree of intergenerational persistence across different social assistance benefits in an effort to understand the forces behind intergenerational disadvantage. Our focus is on the Australian social safety net because it provides a particularly valuable case for studying the issues at hand. Australian social policy is determined at the national level and administered by the Department of Human Services (DHS) through a single central agency known as Centrelink. This results in DHS maintaining an administrative database that includes payment records of all Australians receiving any form of social security benefit. Some benefits can be characterized as social assistance (welfare), while others have either weak or no income test, making them nearly universal for families with children. We use administrative social security (Centrelink) records linked over time and within families, giving us detailed social assistance trajectories—across the entire social safety net—for a birth cohort of young adults and their families over an 18-year period. Our strategy is to exploit variation in the degree of intergenerational persistence across social programs—each differing in their target populations—to draw conclusions about how disadvantage is transmitted from parents to children.====We first document that young people are 1.8 times more likely to need social assistance as adults if their parents have a history of receiving social assistance. They also need more intensive support, receiving an additional $12,000 of social assistance over an 8-year period. Intergenerational persistence is particularly strong for benefits targeting disability, caring responsibilities, and single parenting.====We then conduct three ancillary analyses that highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning intergenerational disadvantage. First, we estimate intergenerational persistence across social programs, allowing us to identify those forms of parental disadvantage with the most extensive consequences. We find that those with disabled parents not only receive more disability support themselves, they also receive more in unemployment and parenting benefits. Parental unemployment, in contrast, is only weakly associated with young people's need for disability support, while parents’ receipt of parenting benefits is mainly associated with an increased chance that young people will also require parenting benefits. Parental disability is a clear pathway through which disadvantage is being passed from Australian parents to their children. Second, we develop a simple conceptual framework to highlight the way that the transmission of personal choice and luck may shape intergenerational welfare dependence. Our empirical analysis indicates that, on balance, parents’ bad luck appears to have a broader impact on youth disadvantage than do their personal choices. Finally, we separately analyze the extensive and intensive margins of the intergenerational persistence in social assistance and investigate whether there is any potential for a causal effect of parental welfare on youths’ social assistance receipt once unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for (see Gottschalk, 1996). Our results from these analyses indicate that in Australia intergenerational disadvantage is more likely to stem from the existence of a poverty trap than from a culture of welfare.====Our work extends the literature that seeks to isolate the mechanisms behind social and economic mobility. Correlational analyses of intergenerational mobility do not identify the causal mechanisms that drive mobility. Researchers, however, have effectively used heterogeneity in the degree of intergenerational mobility across time (e.g., Gottschalk, 1996; Beaulieu et al., 2005; Ekhaugen, 2009); geographic areas (e.g., Corak, 2006, Corak, 2013; Chetty et al., 2014); or family structure (e.g., Björklund et al., 2006, 2007) to rule some mechanisms into the possibility set and others out. We are the first to address this issue by exploiting disparity in intergenerational mobility both within—and across—the various programs that together constitute the social safety net. Each program is designed to address a different form of disadvantage, allowing us to draw inferences about the mechanisms that transmit disadvantage from parents to children. Moreover, our data offer a broad perspective on the entire social assistance system in Australia, capturing people who, due to eligibility conditions or changing circumstances, transition from one program to another while still being broadly reliant on social assistance. These people are missed by analyses that focus on a single program (e.g., unemployment insurance). Our single-country analysis accounts for the broader institutional context (e.g., labor markets, health and educational systems, social norms) which is an advance over cross-country comparisons which have been the focus of prior comparative work (see Chetty et al., 2014).====Crucially, our estimates constitute average, not marginal, population parameters. Previous studies of intergenerational welfare receipt often rely on the quasi-experimental variation generated by eligibility rules to estimate the effects of parents’ welfare receipt (e.g., Dahl et al., 2014; Dahl and Gielen, 2020). This empirical strategy generally results in causal estimates. Inevitably, however, what is being estimated are local average treatment effects, i.e., the effect of welfare receipt only for those on the margin of welfare eligibility (e.g., people who receive welfare after a legal appeal or due to small changes in welfare guidelines). If treatment effects are heterogenous, these local average treatment effect estimates are informative about the transmission of disadvantage from marginal welfare recipients to their children; but they leave us ignorant about the intergenerational spillover in benefit receipt to the children of average welfare participants (see De Hann and Schreiner 2018). Our estimates, on the other hand, identify population average effects ensuring that comparisons across different welfare payments highlight the overall degree of intergenerational persistence in disadvantage within the population more generally. While not causal, they help us understand the nature of welfare dependence and “use that knowledge to prioritize possible causal mechanisms, generate hypotheses and intervention strategies, interpret the findings of causal research, diagnose problems for practitioners and policymakers to address, and identify new issues to study” (Loeb et al., 2017, p.1).====Importantly, we circumvent many of the data limitations that have plagued researchers in the past. Estimates of intergenerational mobility are sensitive to the way that they are constructed. Short observation windows (Page, 2004; Mazumder, 2005); attenuation bias due to measurement error (Solon, 1992; Zimmerman, 1992; Bowles and Gintis, 2002); and noisy proxies (e.g., income, occupation, education) of social and economic status (Clark and Cummins, 2015) can lead to smaller estimates of intergenerational persistence. Recall bias may occur if people find it difficult to accurately report the nature of the benefits that they have received (Pepper, 2000). Our data capture an entire cohort of Australians and their families receiving social assistance. They are drawn from the Australian government's administrative system and span an 18-year period allowing us to minimize any biases associated with measurement error, recall issues, sample attrition, or short study periods. Our large sample sizes make it possible to precisely estimate differences in economic mobility across narrowly defined benefit types. Administrative data linking the receipt of social assistance across generations—such as we analyze here—are rare (Corak, 2006; Dahl et al., 2014; Mitnik et al., 2015), yet they are proving to be very powerful.====Our research contributes to the broader debate on whether the playing field is uneven; that is, whether equality of opportunity is simply becoming an elusive goal.==== Equality of opportunity is often described as offsetting “differences in outcomes attributable to luck, but not those differences in outcomes for which individuals are responsible” (Roemer and Trannoy, 2016, p. 1289). Measures of intergenerational correlations are in and of themselves not very helpful in forming judgements about the extent to which children face equal opportunities. Sorting this out requires that we distinguish the influence of differential circumstances (luck)—for which people should be compensated—from the influence of differences in personal choices—for which they should not (see Corak, 2013; Jusot et al., 2013). Disparity in intergenerational persistence across social programs is informative because, while some programs are primarily designed to insure people from bad luck (e.g., disability benefits), others (e.g., unemployment benefits) also reflect important choices that people have made. By identifying which types of parental disadvantage are most likely to be transmitted to children, we learn more about why the playing field is uneven.",Intergenerational disadvantage: Learning about equal opportunity from social assistance receipt,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712200166X,30 September 2022,2022,Research Article,57.0

We randomly divide a sample of high-performing high school students into two groups: we assign students in one group to teams of varying gender composition, and we allow the students in the other group to form teams freely. We find that the latter choose more male-predominant teams than the former, and if self-selected into gender-biased teams, students prefer even more gender-biased teams ex-post. We also find that female-predominant teams underperform other types of teams when we form teams exogenously, but these differences disappear when students form teams endogenously.","Since the 1970s, the increase in female labor force participation has changed the demography of the workplace. In the working context, the chances of having teams diversified by gender have increased. In several countries, the introduction of gender quotas has fostered the integration of women in specific segments of the labor market: this is the case, for example, in professions such as politics and in the corporate sector. Greater female representation on political committees, company boards, and other group settings makes it important for academics and policymakers to understand the effects of gender composition on team dynamics and performance. The gender composition of teams has significant consequences for corporate performance and collective decision making (Bagues, Esteve-Volart, 2010, Born, Ranehill, Sandberg, 2020, Carter, Simkins, Simpson, 2003, Coffman, Flikkema, Shurchkov, 2021, Farrell, Hersch, 2005). Indeed, males and females show differences in attitude to risk (Borghans, Heckman, Golsteyn, Meijers, 2009, Iriberri, Rey-Biel, 2021), social preferences (Croson and Gneezy, 2009), social confidence (Alan et al., 2020), willingness to make decisions on behalf of others (Ertac, Gurdal, 2012, Ertac, Gurdal, 2019), and preferences over competitive environments (Balafoutas, Fornwagner, Sutter, 2018, Flory, Leibbrandt, List, 2015, Gneezy, Niederle, Rustichini, 2003, Gneezy, Rustichini, 2004, Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007, Saccardo, Pietrasz, Gneezy, 2018, Sutter, Glätzle-Rützler, 2015, and Datta Gupta et al., 2013). These differences may lead to different working dynamics within a team, thus affecting performance.====In the work or academic context, groups are usually endogenously formed. In the presence of taste-based discrimination, individuals’ capacity to choose their teams may crucially influence teams’ gender composition and the working dynamics of male versus female-predominant teams. If individuals with specific characteristics self-select into gender-biased teams, endogeneity of group formation makes it difficult to estimate the effect of gender composition on team performance for the entire population. Azmat and Petrongolo (2014) state that, with the experimental approach, we can solve this problem through random assignment to groups. However, they also acknowledge that experiments create an artificial environment that may not mirror many real contexts. Indeed, existing experimental research that studies the impact of the gender ratio on team performance using endogenously and exogenously formed teams find differing results (Apesteguia, Azmat, Iriberri, 2012, Hoogendoorn, Oosterbeek, Van Praag, 2013). Managers and educators considering whether to form working teams themselves or to allow individuals to form them can benefit from information regarding which team formation rule maximizes performance or reduces heterogeneity across groups. In this paper, we first estimate the impact of the gender mix on team performance. We then analyze the influence of the team formation rule (exogenous versus endogenous) on team performance. Finally, we study how the possibility to self-select into teams transforms the relationship between the gender mix and team performance.====We use a three-day-long mathematics camp for high-performing students to design an experiment in which we randomly divide students into two groups. In the first group, we randomly assign students to teams with different gender compositions. We call this the group of exogenously formed teams. We let the second group form their teams endogenously. Each team has six members, allowing for seven possible gender compositions. We define male-predominant teams as those with four or more males, female-predominant teams as those with four or more females, and gender-balanced teams as those with three males and three females. Using exogenously formed teams, we first study the effect of belonging to teams with various gender mixes. The outcomes we look at are tastes for gender mix in the team, team performance, individual performance, and potential mechanisms. We then investigate the effect of the team formation rule (exogenous vs. endogenous) on the outcomes using the whole sample. Third, we compare the differences between male-predominant, female-predominant, and gender-balanced teams reported for exogenously formed teams (which we can interpret as causal effects) with those reported for endogenously formed teams (which are affected by self-selection). We are particularly interested in exploring whether and how the possibility to self-select into teams reshapes the relationship between gender mix and team performance. Lastly, we investigate the mechanisms behind the relationships between the team formation rule, gender composition, and team performance, focusing on the role of ability-based sorting versus team dynamics.====We find that when subjects are free to choose whom to work with, individuals display a preference for male-predominant teams and that individuals choosing gender-biased teams declare that they prefer even more gender-biased teams after the camp. Our results also show that female-predominant teams underperform other types of teams when we form teams exogenously, but these differences disappear when students form teams. We also find that endogenous male-predominant teams perform worse than exogenous male-predominant teams. Differences in performance are in line with differences in teams’ working styles, students’ self-perception, and within-team heterogeneity. Exogenous male-predominant and gender-balanced teams are more likely to specialize than exogenous female-predominant teams. Females who self-selected into male-predominant teams feel less talented than those who self-selected into other types of teams. Males who self-selected into male-predominant teams think they contributed less to the team than those who chose other types of teams. Finally, endogenous male-predominant teams show significantly higher within-team heterogeneity compared to exogenous male-predominant teams. These results contribute to explain the high performance of exogenous male-predominant teams.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

When the firm has better information, vis-à-vis the market, about the entrepreneurial ability of the employee, its decision to implement the worker’s project serves as a signal of high ability. This provides the firm with an incentive to distort the corporate venturing decision to conceal information from the market. The model provides a rationale for why the likelihood of corporate venturing decreases with the worker’s tenure at the firm. Also, the analysis shows that higher degrees of competition in the firm’s core business weaken its incentive to distort project implementation, thereby leading to higher levels of corporate venturing activity.","A well-documented finding in the entrepreneurship literature is that a significant fraction of entrepreneurs conceives ideas that are translated into new ventures during their previous employment. For example, Bhide (1994) finds that 71% of new startups commercialize an idea that their founders obtained or developed when they were employed by an established firm. Similarly, Agarwal and Shah (2014) report that the fraction of startups formed by former employees of established firms ranges from 24% (e.g., the automobile and legal services industries) to over 80% (e.g., the information technology and communications and the high-tech manufacturing industries).====As translating a business idea into a successful venture provides the entrepreneur with significant financial and non-pecuniary benefits, it raises an important concern for firms. First, the departure of an employee who has talent, skills or information critical to the firm has detrimental effects on its profits (Campbell et al., 2012). Second, the attractiveness of entrepreneurship creates a conflict of interest between firms and their employees to the extent that employees allocate scarce resources (e.g., their effort or time) between exploring new ideas and performing the tasks assigned by the firm (Hellmann, 2007b). As a reaction to employee departures, either to join a rival firm or to start a new venture, firms can take some measures that potentially hinder mobility. For example, they can make use of contracting to induce the worker to focus on the assigned tasks rather than on exploring new ideas (Hellmann and Thiele, 2011), and to impose restrictions on mobility through non-compete clauses or break-up fees (e.g., Franco, Mitchell, 2008, Mukherjee, Vasconcelos, 2018).==== Further, firms can adjust their patenting and litigation strategies (Agarwal, Ganco, Ziedonis, 2009, Kim, Marschke, 2005) or invest in complementary assets (Hvide and Kristiansen, 2012) to reduce the value of the employee’s options outside the firm.====This paper considers an alternative strategy that can reduce the mobility of important employees. Specifically, I focus on the firm’s decision to implement new projects conceived by its employees when the firm has better information about their entrepreneurial ability than does the market. Such an informational asymmetry provides the firm with an incentive to distort the implementation decision in order to conceal information from the market. I examine the implications of this mechanism on corporate venturing.====In this setting, the worker who conceives a project is indispensable for the implementation of the project, yet she is also important for the firm’s ongoing businesses. The two key pieces of information that determine the expected value of a project concern the project’s content and the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. To seek financing, the worker reveals the content of her project to potential financiers—the firm and venture capitalists—which then use their expertise to assess the value of the project.==== Thus, all potential financiers have the same information about the return the project would yield if it is implemented successfully. By contrast, there is an informational asymmetry regarding the worker’s entrepreneurial ability, which is critical to successful implementation. As in the literature on asymmetric employer learning (e.g., Greenwald, 1986, Waldman, 1984), the firm has better information, vis-à-vis the market, about the worker characteristics that can only be revealed over time in an employment relationship. Such characteristics, which are also relevant to entrepreneurial ability, include having diverse managerial skills (Lazear, 2005), the amount and complexity of the knowledge set acquired at the incumbent firm (Chatterji, 2009, Ganco, 2013), ongoing relationships with potential suppliers and clients (Byun et al., 2019). Observing these characteristics, the firm is therefore better-equipped to determine the success potential of the proposed project.====I consider a two-period model with three types of risk-neutral players: firms, venture capitalists and a worker. Both firms and venture capitalists operate in competitive markets. At the beginning of the first period, the worker is hired by a firm and then assigned to the firm’s core business. Apart from performing the assigned tasks at the core business, the worker engages in an entrepreneurial activity (====) by exerting effort to conceive a project. The potential return from the project is increasing in effort, and undertaking the project generates a positive return, which equals the project’s potential return, if and only if the worker has high entrepreneurial ability. At the beginning of the second period, the worker approaches the firm and the venture capitalist to seek financing for her project.==== The key aspect of the information structure is that while the worker’s productivity at the firm’s core business is public information, the players learn about her entrepreneurial ability in an asymmetric manner. Accordingly, the firm observes a private signal about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability after one period of employment. Upon observing the signal, the firm decides between ==== (i.e., implementing the worker’s project in a new venture to which the worker is assigned as a manager) and assigning the worker to the core business. The venture capitalist uses the firm’s decision to update its beliefs concerning the worker’s entrepreneurial ability and then bids for her. Observing the venture capitalist’s offer, the firm makes a counteroffer, and then the worker chooses one of these offers.====I begin my analysis with a benchmark case in which all players have the same information about the worker. Because there is no informational asymmetry, the firm’s corporate venturing decision does not convey any information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. In equilibrium the firm matches the venture capitalist’s offer and retains the worker either in the core business or at a new venture where her project is implemented. More specifically, if the worker’s expected entrepreneurial ability exceeds a cutoff, the firm finds it too expensive to convince the worker to give up her project and it thus implements the project through corporate venturing. Otherwise, it shelves the project and retains the worker in the core business. Notably, although her project may not be implemented at all, the worker’s effort choice is not distorted because her earnings in the second period equal the expected surplus generated by the project. The benchmark analysis yields several predictions concerning corporate venturing decisions. First, higher degrees of competition in the firm’s main line of business lead to more corporate venturing. Second, stronger complementarity between the proposed project and the firm’s core business increases the likelihood of corporate venturing. Finally, the firm becomes less likely to implement the project as the worker gets more important for its core business. As will be discussed, these predictions are consistent with the empirical findings in the literature.====Next, I introduce asymmetric learning by allowing the firm to observe a private signal about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. In contrast to the benchmark case, the firm’s decision to implement the worker’s project serves as a signal of high ability. As in Milgrom and Oster (1987) and Ghosh and Waldman (2010), the equilibrium is characterized by a winner’s curse in which venture capitalists avoid overvaluing the worker. That is, their offers are consistent with the belief that the worker’s entrepreneurial ability is the lowest among workers with the same public signals (i.e., the same prior and job assignment). Observing the corporate venturing decision, the venture capitalist increases its bid, and therefore, the firm must offer a higher wage to retain the worker. Hence, the informational asymmetry results in an additional tradeoff between implementing lucrative projects and raising the retention cost, and this tradeoff may lead to a distortion in corporate venturing decisions. The analysis reveals that if the firm’s private signal is sufficiently precise, the worker is assigned to the core business even when it is not efficient to do so. In other words, to conceal favorable information about the worker, the firm skips lucrative projects, which would have been implemented in the symmetric-information case. By contrast, the firm does not distort project implementation if the signal is not sufficiently precise. That is, the firm uses the signal to update its belief concerning the worker’s entrepreneurial ability and then implements her project if it is efficient to do so. The distortion, if there is any, is exacerbated by the worker’s weakened effort incentives. That is, anticipating that she would not be able to reap the full benefits from her effort, the worker exerts lower effort and consequently conceives a project with a lower potential return. Because the firm’s opportunity cost of retaining the worker at the core business is positively related to the project’s value, lower effort provision strengthens the firm’s incentive to skip lucrative projects and therefore generates an additional channel that contributes to the inefficiency in corporate venturing.====The model’s implications that result from the informational asymmetry are consistent with the existing empirical findings. The analysis reveals that the incidence of corporate venturing decreases as the firm’s private information about the worker gets more precise. To consider the extent to which this prediction is consistent with the empirical findings of the related papers, I follow the literature on asymmetric employer learning in which the worker’s tenure at the current firm is used to proxy the firm’s informational advantage vis-à-vis the market (e.g., Ekinci, Kauhanen, Waldman, 2019, Kahn, 2013). Consistent with the model, some studies find that the probability of entrepreneurship is negatively related to the worker’s tenure at the firm (e.g., Andersson, Baltzopoulos, Lööf, 2012, Braguinsky, Klepper, Ohyama, 2012, Gambardella, Ganco, Honoré, 2015). Further, the model provides an alternative explanation to the positive relationship between competition and innovation.==== Accordingly, as the firm faces more intense competition in the core business, its incentive to conceal information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability is curtailed. Hence, increased competition mitigates the distortion in project implementation, thereby raising the corporate venturing activity.====To complete the analysis, I consider two extensions of the model. First, to capture the fact that firms launch corporate venturing programs to identify promising employee projects, I allow the firm to conduct a costly evaluation to increase the precision of its signal. In this case, the firm’s equilibrium choice of signal precision is mainly determined by the project’s potential return.==== When the potential return is sufficiently high, the firm dedicates a low amount of resources to the evaluation process, meaning that the precision of its private signal is also low. In this case, there is no distortion in the corporate venturing decision. By contrast, when the potential return from the project is sufficiently low, the firm invests for high precision and assigns the worker to the core business even if it observes favorable information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. Second, I introduce turnover into the model.==== As in the main analysis, the worker’s job assignment is determined by an ability cutoff above which the firm opts for corporate venturing. Two additional results from this analysis are worth noting. First, because the worker leaves the firm with positive probability regardless of her job assignment, the firm offers a higher wage to mitigate the risk of losing the worker. Second, the worker’s effort choice is distorted if she anticipates that her project will not be implemented by the firm. This, in turn, raises the ability cutoff and thus aggravates the inefficiency in project implementation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work in the literature. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 analyzes the benchmark case in which no additional information about the worker is collected. Section 5 analyzes the equilibrium behavior when a signal about the worker is publicly and privately observed, respectively.

This paper’s aim is to fill this gap. Using the panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we first establish that negative life events unrelated to the labour market have a significant adverse impact on individuals’ mental health, and then we demonstrate that both job insecurity and job stress exacerbate this impact. We also find gender heterogeneity in the results that shows job insecurity and job stress affect female workers primarily and more severely.","Traumatic life events can have a non-negligible impact on individuals’ mental health and well-being (Dustmann, Fasani, 2016, Kristiansen, 2021, Mahuteau, Zhu, 2016, Mervin, Frijters, 2014). Nevertheless, the ways people react to traumatic life events can differ, depending on whether their situational factors act as moderators or amplifiers. Indeed, psychological theory is clear about the importance of situational factors and their interaction with life events in determining a person’s mental health disorders (VandenBos, 2007).====This paper focuses on workplace-related situational factors, namely job insecurity and job stress, and assesses the modifying role of these adverse job conditions when traumatic events occur. The focus on these job conditions is well justified in an attempt to understand the mental health effects of traumatic events for two main reasons. First, employment per se is vital to mental health (Cottini, Lucifora, 2013, Cygan-Rehm, Kuehnle, Oberfichtner, 2017, Farré, Fasani, Mueller, 2018). Second, the workplace is one of the most important venues for social interactions. Typically, for full-time employees, working accounts for most of their activities outside their homes. Therefore, job conditions could be important for workers’ mental health and, thus, their resilience to mental health shocks.====Historically, most working conditions–related health concerns were associated with workers’ physical safety and thus their physical health. However, given the decline of the manufacturing sector, the expansion of the service sector and the use of digital technology, these concerns shifted gradually towards concerns regarding workers’ mental health (Cappelli, 1997, Johnson, Dey, Nguyen, Groth, Joyce, Tan, Glozier, Harvey, 2020), especially in developed countries. As a result, there is a growing body of literature on the impact of job insecurity and job stress on mental health and well-being (Belloni, Meschi, Pasini, 2016, Bünnings, Kleibrink, Weßling, 2017, Caroli, Godard, 2016, Cottini, Ghinetti, 2018, Cottini, Lucifora, 2013, Dickerson, Green, 2012, Eibich, 2015, Green, 2011, Johnston, Shields, Suziedelyte, 2020, Van Aerden, Puig-Barrachina, Bosmans, Vanroelen, 2016). Nevertheless, there is scarce literature on the labor market–related factors’ modifying effects on workers’ mental health and well-being. Notably, Green (2011) suggests that a person’s employability has a protective effect on the mental health of those who experience unemployment or job insecurity. In the same spirit, the work by Choi et al. (2020) shows that financial well-being mitigates the impact of job insecurity on financial stress.==== Thus, the current empirical evidence focuses mainly on how positive personal attributes could counterbalance negative situational factors but does not consider adverse job conditions’ role when a negative shock occurs.====To fill this gap in the literature, we estimate the modifying effect of adverse job conditions on the mental health of individuals exposed to significant adverse life events. To do so, we use data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, Waves 2 to 19, focusing on life events that are not directly related to job market participation. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, where our primary treatment variable indicates whether an individual was exposed to traumatic life events, we first estimate the mental health impacts of negative life events.==== To ensure that both the level and the trend of the control group’s pre-treatment outcomes and individual’s characteristics are as close as possible to the treatment group’s and, thus, to mitigate potential selection based on the observables, we combine the DiD approach with a propensity score matching (PSM) approach. The PSM approach eliminates outliers with no close matches in terms of observed individual characteristics or past outcome values. Discarding outliers allows us to associate the outcome differences between the two groups with the occurrence of the events. We then use a triple difference (DDD) approach to determine whether the events’ negative mental health impact increases with the levels of job insecurity and job stress experienced by individuals before the events.====Our results suggest that job insecurity and job stress amplify a trauma’s negative mental health impacts. More specifically, the adverse life events’ effect on the mental health score is 0.22 standard deviations higher for workers with high job insecurity than for those with low job insecurity.==== Likewise, comparing the effects on workers with high and low job stress levels, the mental health score decline for the former is about 0.19 standard deviations higher than the latter. Furthermore, the results suggest a gender difference in the amplifying roles of job insecurity and job stress. Specifically, we find that job insecurity affects females only, and that while job stress affects both females and males, the effect on females is much stronger.====This paper contributes to our understanding of the epidemiology of poor mental health. According to the diathesis-stress model, stressful conditions can hasten the development of mental disorders among people with a genetic or biological predisposition to certain disorders (VandenBos, 2007). Similarly, the stress-vulnerability model suggests that social factors can play a role in precipitating the onset of mental disorders (ibid). To the extent that poor job conditions serve as a proxy for some chronic stressors, our findings can be interpreted as quantitative evidence of these models. This paper also contributes to the literature on job conditions by highlighting a potential pathway through which mental health deterioration arising from significant life events can be prevented or attenuated.====Our findings have important implications for the recent development of remote work and the gig economy. Specifically, the gig economy has been blooming, but its flexible job arrangement has led to minimal job stability and protection and, hence, higher job insecurity. Likewise, while competition in the labour market may drive up productivity, it comes with the cost of heightening stress among workers (Peck and Theodore, 2000). Against this background, our findings add weight to the argument about the importance of having a sustainable workplace culture and work–life balance.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The unemployed population contains two groups—those with jobs and those without jobs. Those with jobs are on furlough or temporary layoff. This group expanded tremendously in April 2020, at the trough of the pandemic recession. They wait out periods of non-work with the understanding that their jobs still exist and that they will be recalled. We show that the resulting temporary-layoff unemployment mostly dissipated by the end of 2020. Potential workers without jobs constitute what we call jobless unemployment. Shocks that elevate jobless unemployment have much more persistent effects. Historical major adverse shocks, such as the financial crisis in 2008, created mostly jobless unemployment and consequently caused extended periods of elevated unemployment. Jobless unemployment reached its pandemic peak in November 2020, at 4.9%, modest by historical standards, and has declined at a faster-than-historical pace since.","The global pandemic led to unemployment of catastrophic proportions in the United States. From February to April of 2020, the unemployment rate spiked from 3.5 percent to 14.7 percent. In May 2020, unemployment began to recover, and by November the unemployment rate had declined by 8 percentage points. For comparison, during the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, it took ten years for total unemployment to decline by 6.5 percentage points. In December 2021, unemployment was only 0.4 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. The recovery of the US unemployment rate has been vastly speedier than its historical pace.====We propose that a key to understanding unemployment in the pandemic is to distinguish between the unemployed who do not have jobs—the jobless unemployed—and the unemployed who retain their jobs but are on layoff and, thus, not working. Our main findings are====In the labor-force statistics of the United States, an individual is unemployed if not working, but available for work, and either actively looking for work or on temporary layoff, waiting to return to an existing job. We refer to the latter category of unemployment as ==== and to the rest of unemployment—as ====.====A major difference between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment is that temporary-layoff unemployment returns to normal much faster than does jobless unemployment. A decline in temporary-layoff unemployment takes place as economic conditions improve and firms recall workers. No search or matching is involved; firm-worker match capital is preserved. In contrast, a decline in jobless unemployment takes time. Creation of new, stable, firm-worker relationships is a long and costly process. Terminated workers often circle through a number of short-term jobs before finding a stable job (Hall and Kudlyak (2019)).====Until the pandemic hit the labor market in March 2020, the great majority of the unemployed fell into the jobless category and were actively looking for work because they had low likelihoods of recall to a previous job. Only a fraction of one percent of the labor force was on temporary layoff. Unemployment was effectively synonymous with joblessness. In view of this fact, most of the search and matching models of labor market dynamics have been designed to model jobless unemployment.====In contrast to previous recessions, which destroyed jobs, the pandemic prevented many millions of individuals from working, but they retained their jobs. We find that during the pandemic recession, the entire increase in the total unemployment rate from February to April came from temporary-layoff unemployment. The huge cohort of layoffs into temporary-layoff unemployment in April 2020 also accounted for most of the incidence of temporary-layoff unemployment afterwards.====Temporary-layoff unemployment also accounted for the entire rapid decline in total unemployment from its peak in April through November 2020. Jobless unemployment increased during this period, reaching its peak in November 2020 at 4.9 percent—slightly less than the average historical rate. Jobless unemployment started its recovery thereafter. In previous recoveries, both total unemployment and jobless unemployment glided downward at a constant proportional rate of approximately 10 log points per year (Hall and Kudlyak (2020)). We find that the decline of jobless unemployment from its pandemic peak in November 2020 was three times faster than its historical pace, until it leveled out at 3.6 percent, its currant value as we write.====Tightness is a key concept in modern thinking about labor-market conditions. In a tight market, typical job-seekers find jobs fairly rapidly. In a recession and its immediate aftermath, tightness is low and the typical job-seeker takes around twice as long to find a new job. During the pandemic, tightness governed job-finding rates for the jobless unemployed.====In the pandemic, the explosion of temporary-layoff unemployment dramatically altered the relation between overall unemployment and tightness. Despite high overall unemployment rates early in the pandemic, the labor market remained reasonably tight during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the overall unemployment rate was a reasonable guide to job-finding rates throughout the labor market. By that standard, the labor market in November 2020, with overall unemployment at 6.7 percent, was slack. In historical times when unemployment was that high, jobs were hard to find. We show that the job-finding rate for the jobless unemployed fell in April 2020 but bounced back later. In November 2020, the job-finding rate among the jobless unemployed was at the level similar to the average rates in 2015 and 2016, when total unemployment was 5.3% and 4.9%, respectively. We note that when using unemployment to measure labor-market tightness in times of unusual volumes of temporary-layoff unemployment, it is appropriate to use the unemployment rate for jobless unemployed in place of the overall unemployment rate.====The standard measure of tightness is the ratio of the number of job vacancies to the number of job-seekers. Available vacancy measures do not include the retained jobs of the temporarily laid-off workers. We note that total unemployment is not an appropriate denominator in the vacancy/unemployment measure of labor market tightness, the numerator is limited to the part of the labor market that matches active job-seekers to posted vacancies. A good deal of confusion has occurred because some commentators use total unemployment in the denominator rather than jobless unemployment.====Because a substantial fraction of workers on temporary layoff do not search, but rather return to their existing jobs, we generalize the concept of job-finding to encompass recall. We call the general process ====. For the jobless unemployed, the work-finding rate is synonymous with the job-finding rate, but for the unemployed on temporary layoff, the work-finding rate is considerably higher than the job-finding rate because it includes recalls. As in the pre-pandemic period, during the pandemic, the work-finding rate among the temporary-layoff unemployed was twice as high as the rate among the jobless unemployed. This also held true for the unemployed at durations of six months or longer.====Our distinction between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment is based on the expectation of recall while unemployed rather than on the outcome of recall after the fact. Recall expectations evolve over an individual’s unemployment spell, and the self-reported reason for unemployment may change. Not all individuals on temporary layoff return to their previous jobs. Some may become jobless unemployed, find new jobs, or leave the labor force. Conversely, as time passes, individuals not classified earlier under temporary-layoff unemployment may learn that they do have a possibility of recall and thus be reclassified as in temporary-layoff unemployment. The classification based on contemporaneous self-reported reason for unemployment captures expectation of recall, which in turn influences action such as search and saving behaviour.====At the onset of the pandemic shock, firms found it necessary to lay off a large number of workers abruptly. They anticipated recalling them on an equally large scale, contrary to the economic circumstances surrounding previous recessions. This is evident from the abrupt explosion of mass temporary layoffs (Kudlyak and Wolcott (2020)). While we do not provide direct measures of recalls, we cite evidence from other studies that confirm that recalls indeed happened on a large scale.====We note that, in the regime created by a pandemic, total unemployment retains its social significance even though a high fraction of the unemployed have retained their jobs. The overall unemployment rate remains an appropriate measure of idled labor input and lost employment income. Higher temporary-layoff unemployment implies a burden on the economy from the decline in the utilization of available labor and a corresponding decline in the earnings of the labor force. However, there is a partially offsetting social benefit from the increased time available for household activities and the preservation of job-specific human capital among workers who do return to their previous jobs.====This paper is about unemployment, but we should note that the pandemic resulted in a substantial decline in the labor force as well. Expansion of unemployment and of the population outside the labor market was accompanied by contraction in employment. In February of 2020, 36.6 percent of the working-age population was out of the labor force, neither working nor unemployed. The fraction out of the labor force rose by 1.9 percentage points to 38.5 percent in November 2020 and remained high. The rise in the population out of the labor force in recessions is rarely this big. For example, in the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, the fraction out of the labor force rate only rose by 0.3 percentage points. Analysis of the social consequences of the rise in the fraction of the population not in the labor force arising from the pandemic would proceed in parallel to the analysis of the rise in the unemployment rate.====The findings in this paper show that it is vital to distinguish between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment in modeling the pandemic labor market and the effects of the policies to ameliorate the impact of the pandemic. Lee et al. (2021) use our classification into jobless and temporary-layoff unemployment to study an unequal employment effects of the pandemic. Gertler et al. (2021) adopt our terminology of jobless and temporary-layoff unemployment in their quantitative model of unemployment dynamics and use the model to study the effect of the pandemic and evaluate the Paycheck Protection Program.

This paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, this paper provides a single unifying framework for the classification error of labor market states, which can be used to analyze both stocks and flows. Second, I compare the proposed model implications with other classification-error correction models and show that the proposed latent variable approach generates similar labor market dynamics as re-interview-survey-based methods. Third, I show that correcting for classification errors with this alternative approach supports but moderates the results of previous studies in terms of the measurement of the unemployment rate and sources of unemployment fluctuations. It (i) mutes the magnitude of an underestimate of the U.S. official unemployment rate and (ii) points to a more (less) prominent role of the job separation margin (the ==== margin) in explaining the unemployment fluctuations."," ====Accurately assessing the labor market is critical for researchers and policymakers. In the United States, the Federal Reserve needs to adequately measure the labor market slack to make monetary policy decisions. Congress considers labor market conditions in implementing fiscal stimulus, training programs, and unemployment insurance policies. However, classification error—in which survey respondents misreport their true labor force status–is substantial in the Current Population Survey (CPS) (e.g., Abowd, Zellner, 1985, Poterba, Summers, 1986).====More generally, classification error can impact our broader understanding of labor markets in two critical dimensions. First, it can affect the measurement of labor market stocks, such as the unemployment rate–a key labor market indicator for policymakers. Second, misstating the fraction of people in each labor market state (employment, unemployment, and non-participation) also results in the mismeasurement of the flows between these states and distorts our understanding of the sources of short-term labor market fluctuations. While the literature analyzing these flows is pioneered by Darby, Haltiwanger, Plant, 1985, Darby, Haltiwanger, Plant, 1986, Blanchard and Diamond (1990), and Davis, Haltiwanger, 1990, Davis, Haltiwanger, 1992 and is rich,==== Shimer (2012) shows that fluctuations in unemployment fluctuations depend more on changes in the job-finding probability (i.e. flows “out” of unemployment) than the job separation rate (flows “in” to unemployment). The central aim of this paper is to investigate this issue, asking: to what extent is the characterization of both labor market stocks and flows sensitive to measurement errors?====The first contribution of this paper is thus to provide a single unifying framework for the misclassification of labor market states which can be used to analyze both stocks and flows. Specifically, this paper proposes a latent variable model to statistically infer a worker’s true labor force status from multiple periods of reported employment status without relying on any external source, in a similar spirit to Feng and Hu (2013), Hu (2008), and Hu (2017). Feng and Hu (2013) estimate latent variable models using labor force history to infer measurement errors like this paper. However, unlike these previous studies, this paper imposes an additional restriction on the statistical model, assuming that the true labor force status follows the first-order Markov process, as in Biemer and Bushery (2000). This restriction, consistent with standard labor market dynamics models (e.g., Blanchard, Diamond, 1990, Mortensen, Pissarides, 1994, Shimer, 2005, and Shimer, 2008), has three key advantages over the original formulation. First, it has less data requirement by allowing estimation on a much shorter sample – just three consecutive months as opposed to three months over nine months in Feng and Hu (2013). The model can thus be applied to a much broader set of data sources. Second, the model, along with better estimation due to less data requirement, allows meaningful analysis of labor market flows by restricting transition probabilities to the unit interval (i.e. zero to one). Third, it produces intuitive, cyclical fluctuations in the probability of transitioning from employment to unemployment (EU) and not in the labor force to unemployment (OU), something that Feng and Hu’s method fails to do. I also verify the robustness of the first-order Markov assumption for the underlying true labor market transition. Even if the data generating process does not follow a first-order Markov process, estimates of the labor market transition probabilities have minor errors (at least for the first three months).====The paper’s second contribution is to apply this method to estimate the magnitude of misclassification. I compare this to three other well-known methods in the literature: the re-interview survey from Abowd and Zellner (1985) (AZ hereafter); the re-interview survey from Poterba and Summers (1986) (PS hereafter); and the original latent variable approach from Feng and Hu (2013) (FH hereafter). As explained in more detail later, AZ and PS use the re-interview survey in which a subsample of survey respondents are re-interviewed of their labor force status for the initial interview. A disagreement exists on the true extent of misclassification, with re-interview surveys producing measurement errors in labor force statuses smaller than those based on the latent-variable model in FH. The model in this paper implies a degree of classification errors between these two estimates, although closer to that of re-interview surveys (AZ and PS) as in Shimer (2012) and Elsby et al. (2015).====The third contribution of this paper is to apply these estimates to analyze two critical questions in labor economics: First, a question about stocks: what is the true unemployment rate?; Second, about flows: what are the sources of unemployment fluctuations? All four error correction methods imply that the official unemployment rate is underestimated. However, when comparing different classification-error-correction methods, FH’s latent variable approach implies a much higher unemployment rate than those of the other three methods (AZ, PS, and HMM). The proposed model in this paper (HMM) implies that the true unemployment rate is much closer to AZ and PS corrections, at 0.6 percentage points higher on average than the official unemployment rate between 1976 and 2018. For the flow analysis, I measure the share of the variance of unemployment fluctuations that is accounted for by different worker flows (the variance decomposition exercise in Section 5). The proposed method (HMM) does not overturn the previous literature’s conclusion regarding the contributions of variability across different labor market flows to the cyclical fluctuations in the unemployment rate, although it does moderate it somewhat. I find that job separation matters more than previously claimed by Shimer (2012), increasing from around 20 percent to nearer 26 percent. The results in this paper also suggest that the importance of the participation margin (i.e. movement in and out of the labor force) in explaining the fluctuations in unemployment is much less than previously estimated–around 16 percent in this paper vs. previous estimates of around 30 percent in Elsby et al. (2015). These results are critical when assessing whether a standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model of labor market fluctuations should treat job separations as endogenous or exogenous and incorporate the participation margin.====There is rich literature on measurement error in reported labor force status. While it is not an exhaustive list of the literature, here I review three broad categories of literature on correcting measurement errors. A traditional approach to correcting reporting inaccuracies is re-interviewing respondents to check their previous labor force status. Abowd and Zellner (1985) (AZ) and Poterba and Summers (1986) (PS), for instance, use the CPS re-interview surveys to calculate the classification error probabilities by comparing the reported labor force status in the original CPS survey with those in the re-interview survey. Table 1 columns (1) and (2) show the probabilities of incorrectly reporting one’s labor force status given the “true” labor force status in AZ and PS, respectively.==== Table 1 suggests substantial degrees of classification error. For example, a significant fraction of unemployed people (based on the re-interview survey) incorrectly reported as being nonparticipants (i.e. out of the labor force) in the original interview.====While this re-interview survey is considered a reliable way to identify the extent of classification error in the CPS, it has several caveats. First, the re-interview surveys are not readily accessible to outside researchers. To my knowledge, the only available reporting error matrices based on the re-interview surveys are from more than 30 years ago and are published in AZ and PS. More importantly, the re-interview surveys are also subject to potential biases and classification errors. For instance, the re-interviews are generally conducted for a small subsample via telephone, while the original surveys were done in person. The time lag between the original interview and the re-interview is another source of potential reporting errors. Moreover, it is well known that workers’ responses in the re-interview often differ depending on whether the respondents had access to their original survey responses, as shown in PS.====Another approach is to infer possible underlying measurement errors of labor market data from some irregularities in the labor market transitions. Elsby et al. (2015), for instance, propose a ==== method for CPS data based on the labor market transitions over three consecutive months. Suppose a survey respondent reports being unemployed (U) in the first and third months while being out of the labor force (O) in the second month (UOU transitions). His/her labor market transition is reclassified as being unemployed for the three consecutive months (i.e. UUU). Similarly, OUO transitions are reclassified as OOO transitions. However, Kudlyak and Lange (2014) argue that such a classification correction method goes against the empirical finding that the job-finding rates for those out of the labor force with recent unemployment (UOU) are five times higher than those out of the labor force for three consecutive months (OOO). More recently, Ahn and Hamilton (2022) also attempt to reconcile internal inconsistencies in stock, flows, and reported unemployment duration for the 2001–2020 CPS data.====An alternative approach is to apply a latent variable model to statistically infer a worker’ s true labor force status from multiple periods of reported employment status without relying on any external source (e.g., Feng, Hu, 2013, Hu, 2008, Magnac, Visser, 1999 and Hu, 2017). By imposing some statistical assumptions on the true underlying labor market transitions and how respondents misreport their true labor force (reporting error probabilities), the labor market histories inform possible magnitudes of measurement error. For instance, FH estimate a variant of latent variable models to estimate the reporting errors based on three months of data (i.e. first, second, and ninth months of labor force status) using the US Current Population Survey. Table 1 column (3) presents the reporting errors from FH. The degree of measurement errors is even more significant than those implied by AZ and PS. For instance, FH’s estimate would imply that close to 40 percent of truly unemployed people misreport their labor force status as either being unemployed (17.3 percent) or out of the labor force (20.2 percent). As shown later, the proposed latent variable model in this paper, which closely follows FH, produces somewhere between FH and re-interview surveys of AZ and PS, but closer to the latter. However, this literature tends to study either stocks or flows, applying methods to correct classification errors that work only for either one or the other. Lastly, using the 1990–1992 French labor force survey, Magnac and Visser (1999) estimate the latent variable model while assuming that the underlying true states follow a first-order Markov process. They do so for six labor market states–permanent employment, fixed-term employment, training, unemployment, education, and out of the labor force and find that measurement errors bias the estimates of some important transition probabilities between states.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a proposed latent variable model to correct classification errors, including its identification and estimation. I also show that the first-order Markov process assumption for the true labor force transition is reasonable in the short sample. I then discusses how this paper differs from a very close paper Feng and Hu (2013). Section 3 describes the Current Population Survey (CPS) data, which I use to estimate a latent variable model. Section 4 presents the main results of the model. In this section, I compare the results across different methods of correcting classification errors in estimating the true unemployment rate and flow probabilities. I also discuss time-aggregation and margin-error corrections and how these corrections affect transition probabilities. Section 5 studies the role of job finding, job separation, or labor force participation margin in explaining unemployment fluctuations.

I exploit a natural experiment where first-year college students in a mandatory writing course are assigned to discussion conferences with varying racial compositions. Within-classroom diversity is effectively random conditional on scheduling availability. I find that a higher degree of classroom diversity increases GPA at ====, improves first year grades of female students, and affects the major choice of white students. I develop a trimming procedure to bound estimates and account for selection into the sample of completers. My results highlight the potential value of racial diversity in higher education and contribute to the debate over race-based admissions policies.","Educators and policy makers care deeply about the racial diversity of student bodies at tertiary institutions. As the former President of the American Council on Education Molly Corbett Board notes, “Leaders of colleges and universities... know firsthand that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body are crucial for our graduates,” adding that, “Education in a vibrant and diverse environment will better prepare... graduates for our increasingly globalized economy” (Broad, 2012). By fostering a diverse environment in which students are exposed to worldviews different from their own, students exchange unfamiliar ideas and challenge prior belief systems, enriching the overall learning experience.====Proponents of affirmative action point to such benefits as justification for college admission preferences favoring minority students. Critics, on the other hand, argue that such race-conscious admission policies are discriminatory and lead to mismatch, whereby weaker students may be better served at less selective institutions (see Sander, 2004 and others). Over the years, a host of legal cases concerning affirmative action has been fought over precisely this issue of diversity at universities and colleges (Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978, Hopwood v. State of Texas, 1996, Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003, Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003, Fisher v. University of Texas, 2016).====Given such intense and longstanding interest in diversity within higher education, measuring its impact on educational outcomes is crucial for understanding policy implications. Yet challenges arise when measuring the effects of diversity because of endogeneity. Selection by students into schools, courses, and classrooms based on unobservable characteristics may bias estimates.====This paper contributes to the literature by presenting causal evidence on the positive effects of racial diversity on academic outcomes in a real-world classroom setting. To find out whether students exposed to a more diverse set of classmates achieve better grades, I exploit a quasi-experimental setting where first-year students in a year-long mandatory writing course at a small four-year college are randomly assigned to discussion conference groups. Conferences have varying levels of diversity in terms of the racial composition of conference group members. I argue that this within-classroom diversity is effectively random conditional on students’ scheduling availability (vis-a-vis other courses enrolled), given the institutional features determining conference assignment, and the fact that students do not know (ex-ante) and cannot manipulate the racial composition of peers in their enrolled conference. I confirm this exogeneity by analyzing predetermined characteristics of students in conferences of varying diversity. Hence, this identification strategy estimates the causal effect of diversity, avoiding selection bias that potentially arises in other situations where better students may select themselves into more diverse environments.====I find that a higher degree of racial diversity in the classroom causes a statistically significant increase in the cumulative grade point average (GPA) at graduation. Point estimates suggest that replacing one White student with one minority student in a typical conference increases graduation GPA by an average of 0.024====. While the average treatment effect on contemporaneous outcomes including GPA at the end of first year and the writing course grade are not statistically significant, these estimates mask heterogeneous effects by sex. I find a beneficial impact of diversity on both first year GPA (statistically significant at 5% level) and writing course grade (statistically significant at 10% level) for female students. For example, female students experience an average marginal effect of diversity on first year GPA that is almost two and a half times the average treatment effect point estimate, while male students experience no statistically significant diversity effect. On the other hand, I do not detect statistically significant heterogeneous effects by race and only limited evidence of heterogeneity by SAT score. I also find that White students in higher diversity classrooms are less likely to take up majors in literature, language, and arts, but are more likely to take up majors in social sciences, history, and philosophy.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Over the next two years, the economy has been on the recovery path. We assess the labor market two years into the COVID crisis. We show that early employment dynamics were almost entirely driven by temporary layoffs and later recalls. Taking these into account, we show that the labor market remained surprisingly tight throughout the crisis, despite the dramatic job losses. By spring 2022, the labor market had largely recovered and was characterized by extremely tight markets and a slightly depressed employment-to-population ratio driven largely by retirements. Finally, we see surprisingly little evidence of excess reallocation, despite predictions that COVID would dramatically and permanently change the way we live and work. We do see that employment has reallocated somewhat away from low-skilled service jobs, and, in light of the job vacancy patterns, conclude that worker preferences or changes in job amenities are driving this shift. In addition, the retirements paved the way for movements up the job ladder, making low-skilled customer-facing jobs even less desirable.","In April 2020, the U.S. economy lost 20 million jobs and, each week, millions of workers filed new unemployment insurance claims. As we showed in Forsythe et al. (2020a), job vacancies collapsed across virtually all sectors, occupations, and geographies, suggesting that the labor market would deteriorate further during the following summer. Surprisingly, by June, nearly half of the lost jobs had returned and vacancies had recovered to 80% of their pre-pandemic level. Over the next two years, the recovery waxed and waned, largely correlated with the timing of new COVID outbreaks. In spring 2021, the number of job vacancies surged, accompanied by a more gradual response in employment. By spring 2022, virtually all labor market indicators had returned to their pre-pandemic levels. However, a lagging employment-to-population ratio, a widespread concern over labor shortages, and the very nature of the COVID shock led many to speculate about the composition and overall strength of the labor market moving forward. In this paper, we document how the labor market evolved over the first two years of the COVID pandemic, and assess the economic picture as it progresses.====The labor market movements early in the pandemic were stunning due to both their magnitude and swiftness. In the first part of this paper, we provide an accounting of these movements. In April, 2020, fully 8% of the working-age population reported that they were on temporary layoff and not searching for alternate work. During the following summer, that share declined nearly as rapidly as it rose. Taking advantage of longitudinally linked Current Population Survey (CPS) data, we show that the spike in temporary layoffs was immediately followed by a spike in movements back to employment that appear to be recalls.==== Rehiring continued, gradually, throughout the remainder of the year, until the excess population on temporary layoff cleared. We also show that there was very little leakage from this group to searching unemployment or out of the labor force. The widespread use of temporary layoffs suggests that employers and workers expected the COVID shock to be short-lived. Despite the fact that the COVID shock has been anything but temporary, employers and separated workers were able to maintain their connection apparently quite well.====However, 2 years out, the employment-to-population ratio was still nearly a point below pre-pandemic levels. We show that roughly half of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio is due to predictable declines in employment from an aging population structure, while the remainder is due to workers aged 65 and older exiting employment at unusually high rates. While all other age groups have essentially recovered, employment for the 65+ remains below its pre-pandemic level and has seen no convergence since fall 2021.====Labor supply emerged as the main constraint to the recovery in spring 2021, when job vacancies soared well beyond their pre-pandemic level. A range of virus-related issues driving lack of participation, combined with the extraordinary use of temporary layoffs served to depress aggregate job search activity throughout the pandemic. In fact, we show in Section 3 that the labor market remained surprisingly tight throughout the pandemic once the unusual nature of unemployment during the pandemic is taken into account. Using headline unemployment numbers, tightness fell by 75% between January and April 2020, to levels not seen since early in the recovery from the Great Recession. This level of slack normally suggests that there are many people competing for each job opening. However, at this point the unemployed population consisted largely of people who were not actively searching for work – the temporarily laid off. Using only searching unemployed to measure tightness also indicates a substantial fall in spring 2020 (roughly a 50% drop), but only back to levels last seen in 2017. Tightness increased steadily in 2021 to well above its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year. Therefore, throughout the pandemic, job seekers faced an easier time finding a job than during previous recessionary periods.====In Section 4, we ask whether COVID-induced reallocation generates frictions in the matching process that might depress the rate at which jobs are formed. Recessions generally are periods of accelerated reallocation (Hershbein, Kahn, 2018, Jaimovich, Siu, 2014) and many expected the COVID crisis to be an especially large reallocation shock (Barrero et al., 2020). While surely the COVID experience will dramatically impact our lives going forward, we are surprised to find little evidence of reallocation. At the beginning of the pandemic, employment composition shifted dramatically across occupations and industries. However, this misalignment was largely undone over the next two years. By spring 2022, the rate at which employment reallocated across industries over the pandemic was similar to that in normal times. Employment across detailed occupations has experienced some excess reallocation, though still a great deal of convergence since the height of the pandemic. These patterns are in stark contrast to earlier recessionary periods when employment composition settled at a new normal.====As of spring 2022, the labor market looks remarkably as it did prior to the pandemic. One exception is a small shift in employment away from customer-facing jobs, in particular in the leisure, hospitality, and other services sectors and in low-skilled service related occupations. To better understand these shortfalls, we exploit rich job vacancy data from Emsi Burning Glass (BGT). We show these areas of the economy have experienced surges in the number of vacancy postings and a relaxing of skill requirements within job ads. The shortfalls therefore look to be driven by labor supply, rather than demand. On the worker side, we find evidence of increased movements out of low-skilled service jobs and towards professional occupations and other areas that tend to be both higher paying and offer lower exposure to health risks. Interestingly, the excess retirements appear to have facilitated movements up the job ladder for lower skilled workers.====Therefore, to the extent that employment has not fully recovered in some areas, those shortfalls appear to largely reflect worker choices and are partly driven by an opening of better opportunities up the job ladder. At the time of this writing, the United States is in the midst of yet another wave of the COVID virus. It could be that greater changes to the labor market will only begin in earnest when the pandemic phase is completely behind us. However, as yet, the labor market shows little sign of doing anything other than converging back to the beginning of 2020.====Our paper contributes to an expanding literature examining the COVID economy. Our first paper on the subject (Forsythe et al., 2020a) took advantage of real-time job vacancy data collected by BGT to show that the economic collapse in spring 2020 was broad-based and unlikely driven by individual state policies but rather was the response to the global pandemic and halting of activity in response to fears of the virus. Since then, researchers using a wide range of datasets corroborated these results and provided additional context for the COVID crisis (for instance Bartik, Bertrand, Lin, Rothstein, Unrath, 2020, Cajner, Crane, Decker, Grigsby, Hamins-Puertolas, Hurst, Kurz, Yildirmaz, 2020, Cortes and Forsythe, Goolsbee, Syverson, 2020, Gupta, Montenovo, Nguyen, Rojas, Schmutte, Simon, Weinberg, Wing, 2020). In this paper, we continue to take advantage of the richness in BGT to explore in-depth patterns of market tightness and reallocation in the COVID recovery.====A particularly salient feature of this cycle, the rising importance of temporary layoffs and recalls, has been explored by several researchers (e.g., Blandin, Bick, Hall, Kudlyak, 2020, Kudlyak, Wolcott).==== We contribute to this literature by providing a taxonomy of the non-employed that allows us to distinguish those actively seeking new employment. Our treatment of the unemployed is consequential for understanding tightness—declining by much less than headline unemployment would suggest—and therefore the state of the recovery.==== Hall and Kudlyak (2020) also present estimates of aggregate tightness that move in line with ours. We contribute a richer characterization of job vacancies and tightness measures across markets using BGT vacancy data, as well as an analysis of changes in skill requirements. This cycle has also brought to the fore another side of labor supply, the large non-participant pool, to which our documentation of early retirements contributes.====Finally, our work on reallocation and mismatch relates back to discussions following the Great Recession, and, in particular work showing that recessions broadly accelerate adoption of labor-saving technologies (Hershbein, Kahn, 2018, Jaimovich, Siu, 2014). The discussion of mismatch following the Great Recession took center stage as people worried that house lock and structural change were elevating the unemployment rate. Elsby et al. (2011); Şahin et al. (2014) measured to what extent vacancies and searchers in the labor market were misaligned and thus quantified the extent to which mismatch kept unemployment elevated following the Great Recession. Though researchers found that mismatch did not drive elevated unemployment rates in the Great Recession, the composition of employment across occupations and industries was permanently altered. Early in the COVID crisis, there was considerable concern of an even more asymmetric shock which would require significant job reallocation (Barrero et al., 2020). However, we are surprised to find that overall the COVID experience looks starkly different from previous recessions.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explores the non-employed, accounts for the recovery, as well as the lack of a full employment recovery. Section 3 examines aggregate tightness over the course of the pandemic. Section 4 examines reallocation. The last section concludes.","Where have all the workers gone?

The belief that a man should earn more than his wife seems to have weakened over the years. However, the belief that mothers bear the main responsibility for childcare remains prevalent across cultures and times.==== Concurrently, female breadwinners are increasingly common in industrialised society, challenging traditional gender norms. Indeed, wives out-earn husbands among 27% of couples in the United States (Bertrand et al., 2015). Households face a dilemma after first childbirth: how should they allocate the new childcare responsibilities?====The idea that agents can gain by specialising in different tasks is central in family economics. In his theory of household specialisation, Becker (1985) argued that gendered differences in comparative advantages cause one spouse to specialise and invest more in skills related to the labour market, and the other spouse to specialise in non-market work (e.g., childcare and housework). Akerlof and Kranton (2000) expanded the economic analysis by integrating identity as a non-financial motive into individuals’ utility functions.==== In their model, deviation from expected behaviour in one's social category is assumed to decrease utility. Hence, people's economic actions can be explained partly by a desire to conform with their sense of self.====In households that have female breadwinners, the childcare allocation dilemma raises and intensifies the following question: Should the partner who has the lower opportunity cost in terms of expected earnings forgone assume the greater cost of parenthood (as implied by Becker's, 1985 model)? Conversely, should a female breadwinner's representation as a caregiver outweigh her comparative advantage in the labour market and push her spouse, whose labour productivity is lower, to specialise in the labour market (as suggested by Akerlof and Kranton, 2000)? While different theoretical models predict different childcare allocations, there has been little empirical research into this dilemma.====In this paper, I examine whether childbearing has a differential effect on the careers of breadwinning/caregiving women and men, using national representative panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and a quasi-experimental approach based on event studies around first childbirth. The empirical evidence that emerges from this investigation aligns with Akerlof and Kranton's (2000) model. My work shows that children's positive impact on men's earnings and employment depends on their relative earning potential; men improve their earnings and employment after first childbirth if their wives had out-earned them before childbirth. In contrast, the negative impact of parenthood on women's earnings and employment is significant and persistent regardless of women's potential relative earnings. To provide a more comprehensive picture of couples’ time allocation and well-being, I complement my findings by showing additional results using time-use and life-satisfaction measures as outcome variables and examining changes in these measures after childbirth.====This work expands on the emerging literature on the impact of parenthood on earnings and subsequent labour-market performance, also known as child penalties. Recent studies show a divergence between men's and women's labour-market trajectories after childbirth. Using Sweden administrative data, Angelov et al. (2016) show that while couples’ earnings and careers move in tandem before first childbirth, the earnings of wives begin to diverge from those of their husbands after that event. Namely, the male–female earnings gap widens by 32 percentage points in the fifteen years after first childbirth. Similar results are observed in the United States (Chung et al., 2017). In Denmark, Kleven et al. (2019a) report a sharp drop in earnings on all three margins—labour-force participation, working hours, and wage rates—for mothers after giving birth to their first child. They deduce that nearly all of Denmark's remaining gender wage gap in recent years is related to childbearing. In a follow-up study, Kleven et al. (2019b) detect similar effects of childbirth on women's labour market trajectories across different countries.====When the effects of pre-childbirth education on child penalties are analysed, the evidence is inconclusive. Studies that evaluate women's child penalties at the top of the education distribution find that these women incur about the same penalties as do women at the bottom of the distribution (Kleven et al., 2019a) and that the earnings gap between the spouses widens even when the female is better educated than the male (Chung et al., 2017). Other studies, however, find a smaller effect of childbirth on the couple's earnings gap when the female spouse is better educated than the male (Angelov et al., 2016). In a recent study, Kleven et al. (2020), estimating earnings potential based on education level, field of study, and labour-market experience, have found that child penalties are unrelated to females’ earning potential. The few studies that use pre-childbirth earnings as a proxy for potential future earnings examine what happens only to spouses’ earnings relative to each other. In Sweden, mothers with higher relative earnings experience a smaller divergence from their spouses’ income after childbirth (Angelov et al., 2016). In the United States, the opposite pattern is observed: Mothers with higher relative earnings experience a much larger divergence from their spouses’ earnings after childbirth (Chung et al., 2017). However, attention to the interparental earnings gap sheds no light on the gender-specific dynamics of earnings because the gap may result from changes in the female spouse's earnings, those of the male spouse, or both.====In this work, I follow the earnings and labour supply of a representative sample of German men and women from 1984 to 2017. Germany's gender gap in earnings is remarkably persistent and relatively wide: On average, women's wages are around 22% lower than men's (Maier, 2007; Selezneva and Van Kerm, 2016). Germany also has one of the widest gender wage gaps among OECD countries (Blau and Kahn, 2003; Selezneva and Van Kerm, 2016). German women also incur relatively large child penalties by other countries’ standards.==== Boelmann et al. (2021) exploit the setting of the German reunification to document persistent differences between east- and west-German first-time mothers in return-to-work behaviour; East-German mothers return to work more quickly and for longer hours than West-German mothers. By looking at migrating mothers, they also show that East-German migrants continue to behave according to their more gender egalitarian culture==== while West-German migrants to the East return to work earlier after childbirth and thus behave more similarly to their East-German colleagues.====While most studies in the field have concentrated on women, my research illuminates the topic from the corresponding standpoint of men. My work shows that children's positive impact on men's earnings and employment on the intensive and extensive margins depends on their pre-childbirth relative earning potential. The earnings and employment trajectories of men who out-earned their wives before childbirth remain stable, whereas men whose potential earnings were less than those of their wives before childbirth tend to improve their earnings and employment after childbirth. In contrast, the negative impact on women is significant and persistent regardless of women's potential earnings before childbirth. These findings have a dual meaning: On the one hand, mothers tend to reduce their labour supply by working fewer hours, working part-time, or opting out of the labour market even ten years after childbirth, irrespective of their potential relative earnings before childbirth. On the other hand, fathers specialise in the labour market irrespective of their relative pre-childbirth earning potential.====This work also contributes to the scant literature on trajectories of time-use and satisfaction measures as a function of pre-childbirth relative earning potential. Given my claim that each gender specialises in a specific activity regardless of its relative earning potential before childbirth, it is of interest to analyse inter-gender differences in satisfaction about these activities following childbirth. To the best of my knowledge, I am the first to connect households’ decisions on allocating responsibilities with satisfaction measures dependent on relative earnings potential before childbirth. Consistent with my main results, I find that fathers who become primary breadwinners only after first childbirth invest more time in childcare and less time on leisure activities relative to pre-childbirth breadwinners men. Respectively, they experience a decrease in their work, housework, and leisure satisfaction relative to the year before childbirth, as opposed to fathers who enjoy a comparative advantage in the labour market in the pre-childbirth year—suggesting that these two subgroups, although following the same career path, diverge in the feelings that accompany their career development. Correspondingly, mothers who tend to withdraw from their specialisations in the labour market are dissatisfied with the increase in their burden of housework.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sections 2 and 3, respectively, describe the data sets and the empirical strategy, after which Section 4 provides graphic evidence for the results. Section 5 reports the results. In Section 5.1, the effect of parenthood on the different subgroups’ labour supply is presented.

Most studies exploit exogenous shocks to wealth, such as lottery prizes and inheritances, to investigate the causal effects of wealth on health, especially in developed countries. This paper draws on data from the China Health and Retirement ","It is common knowledge that people with higher incomes have, on average, better health. This phenomenon is well-studied in health economics. Many studies have discovered positive correlations between wealth or socioeconomic status and individual health measurements (Ettner, 1996, Meer, Miller, Rosen, 2003, Kim, Ruhm, 2012). Much causal evidence on the health-wealth nexus has also been found, exploiting data on exogenous windfalls such as lottery and inheritance gains in developed countries (Lindahl, 2005, Apouey, Clark, 2015, Cesarini, Lindqvist, Östling, Wallace, 2016, Kim, Koh, 2021). Conclusions, however, remain mixed. Few have explored the nexus thoroughly in a developing country context yet. As the largest fast-growing developing country, China has seen an increase in its average family housing wealth from around 2,100 ==== in 1995 to around 100,000 ==== in 2017 (Li and Fan, 2020). However, the effects of rising wealth on health and health-related outcomes in China remains under-studied.====This paper considers the health-wealth nexus for the elderly in China and finds mixed evidence of wealth effects on health outcomes, with mostly negative impacts on healthy behaviours and healthcare utilisation among older adults. The seminal work of Grossman (1972) models the positive impact of wealth shocks on health status through increases in health-related investment. In contrast, another branch of the literature finds that positive income shocks may negatively affect health status via less healthy lifestyle choices (van Kippersluis, Galama, 2014, Apouey, Clark, 2015). Such conclusions are echoed in this paper: I observe older adults have less healthy lifestyles when experiencing positive wealth growth.====Previous literature suggests possible endogeneities, generally caused by reverse causalities and unobservable characteristics at the individual or household level, between one’s wealth and health status. I employ the simulated price method devised by Lovenheim and Mumford (2013) to identify the causal effects of wealth on health-related outcomes. The housing value serves as a proxy for household wealth in their method. This is reasonable because housing wealth accounts for more than 60% of household wealth in China (Li et al., 2020). The simulated price method employs a variation in house value in different households over waves caused only by prefecture city-level price changes.==== The exogeneity of this method is based on the assumption that the timing and magnitude of the housing boom in prefecture-level cities are not correlated with one’s health-related outcomes. The dataset used is the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which details health and health-related outcomes for people aged 45 and older, as well as prefecture-level information. I limit the regression sample to urban homeowners, given that the commercial housing market in China exists only in urban areas.====Applying the Lovenheim and Mumford (2013) method, I find that a 1,000,000-==== increase (equivalent to ==== $130,000 ====) in the total value of properties owned decreases the probability of having hypertension by 3.33 percentage points for the elderly in China. The same amount of growth increases the probability of having dyslipidemia and feeling depressed by 1.96 and 2.66 percentage points, respectively. In terms of healthy lifestyles, a positive wealth growth of 1,000,000 ==== reduces the probability of drinking/smoking and socialising with others by 2.48 and 1.37 percentage points, respectively. There is a negative effect of the same amount of growth on in-patient expenditures, the magnitude of which is 319.5 ==== (around $40).====There are two crucial subsample checks for the main results. One is for the difference in education levels, and the other is for the income disparity. The subsample results imply that the wealth increase imposes adverse effects on health status, especially on those with low education levels who are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviours. The results also find income heterogeneity in response to wealth shocks, similar to the heterogeneity proposed by van Kippersluis and Galama (2014). To eliminate possible selection bias caused by residence relocations, I conduct a robustness check on the sample of those who had not moved since their first appearance in the survey. The findings from this limited sample are consistent with my primary conclusion. Other robustness checks, such as adding individual fixed effects and varying cluster levels, yield consistent results.====Previous studies have compiled evidence on the causal effects of wealth on health for developed countries, but primarily for middle-aged and younger individuals (Lindahl, 2005, Cesarini, Lindqvist, Östling, Wallace, 2016, Kim, Koh, 2021). In these works, lottery winnings and inheritance gains are used as exogenous shocks to household wealth. Using these exogenous shocks, Lindahl (2005) and Kim and Koh (2021) confirm the positive causal nexus; while Cesarini et al. (2016) find no evidence, which may result from the comprehensive social safety net in developed countries. Meanwhile, van Kippersluis and Galama (2014) show the harmful effects of wealth on health via unhealthy consumption. Hence, the directions of wealth effects remain debatable.====This paper is specifically related to the literature studying the effects of rising housing values on health-related outcomes. Most studies find positive effects of housing prices on health outcomes and healthcare expenditures in the U.S. and the EU (Davis, 2004, Fichera, Gathergood, 2016). More recently, papers have focused on the effects of the housing market on health in China, yet there is no consensus on whether the effects are positive or negative (Liu, Liu, 2020, Xu, Wang, 2020). Despite this attention, the health-wealth nexus for older adults has received little attention, especially in China. As China turns into an ageing society, the welfare of the elderly, particularly their health, has emerged as an important and understudied topic.====This paper seeks to fill this gap by documenting the health-wealth nexus for ageing people in China. One advantage of studying this nexus in China is that the country has insufficient public health insurance. The effects of wealth growth on health may be more significant than in developed countries with comprehensive social security systems. Surprisingly, this paper finds mostly negative wealth effects on healthcare use and healthy behaviours when controlling for health insurance status. One possible explanation for this negative wealth effect could be that health literacy in China is not as high as in developed countries (Yuan, Qian, Huang, Tian, Xiang, He, Feng, 2015, He, Cheng, Shao, Liu, Shao, Bishwajit, Feng, Feng, 2016). Sudden wealth increase without good health knowledge could worsen one’s health. The subsample results show that those with little education generally drive negative health outcomes with wealth increments, since poor health knowledge is often a concomitant of poor education. The results can be linked to the education component in health accumulation proposed in Grossman (1972), which states that education increases individuals’ efficiency in accumulating health capital. From this point of view, the results of this paper help reconcile the Grossman model and the literature on risky health behaviour.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed background on the health-wealth nexus and the booming housing market in China. In Section 3, after a sketch of the theoretical framework underlying the health-wealth nexus, I introduce the empirical method and the results using the main identification method. Next come robustness checks and subsample analysis in Section 4.

We explore how teammate personality traits impact productivity on joint team tasks. Studying student teams at a large university and considering the “Big Five” personality characteristics of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness, we find that teammate conscientiousness has a small, positive impact on team performance: a one standard deviation increase in teammate conscientiousness increases performance on a team task by about three percent of a standard deviation in our preferred specification. The effect is evident holding teammate ability and gender fixed, and suggestively operates through improved team functioning and sustained increases in student effort. We also find evidence of positive spillovers from teammate openness and negative spillovers from teammate extroversion.","The extent to which personality traits can predict and explain behavior has been debated for decades. Increasing evidence indicates that they causally impact schooling and labor market outcomes (Borghans et al., 2008; Almlund et al., 2011; Borghans et al., 2016). But, many goods and services are produced in teams, and we know less about whether personality factors exert externalities on those around them, their teammates. Given the established evidence that peer attributes such as ability and gender affect individual decision-making and outcomes====, the potential for people to be impacted by the personality traits of their peers at school or work is clear. This paper adds to our understanding of peer spillovers by investigating whether the productivity of small teams is affected by the personality characteristics of team members.====We study three-person student teams in a large statistics course in college. Students are observed in multiple teams through the semester. Team production is measured by performance on team tests that are jointly taken in class by team members that have experience working together. This environment is particularly well-suited for studying peer effects within teams for three reasons. First, students are randomly assigned into teams, so potential nonrandom selection into peer groups is not a concern, and we can identify causal peer composition effects. Second, the course is structured so that students work repeatedly with their teammates for a month in a flipped classroom environment before taking the tests, providing an opportunity to observe both cumulative and contemporaneous personality spillovers. And, third, the team test questions we use to measure team production are subsets of individual test questions that are taken by students a few days before the team tests, so we have highly comparable measures of individual and team output that allow us to isolate the “value-added” of working with teammates rather than as an individual.====We find that a one standard deviation increase in teammate conscientiousness boosts question scores on team tests by about three percent of a standard deviation. This effect is small, but is similar in magnitude to other recently-estimated peer personality effects (such as Golsteyn et al. 2019). More suggestively, we also find negative effects of teammate extroversion and positive effects of teammate openness. Our richest specification includes student fixed effects and controls for the performances of team members on the recently taken individual test, so our estimated effect can be interpreted as the impact of peer personality holding the ability of the team constant. The estimates are also robust to including teammate gender and a measure of teammate baseline statistics comprehension in the model.====Conscientious teammates may improve team performance through a variety of channels. Indirectly, conscientious students are likely to work harder and exert more effort when studying on their own, and therefore may bring more knowledge and understanding into the team environment; we consider this an indirect ability effect. Directly, conscientious peers may positively influence the study efforts of teammates through the example they set, as well as improve team functioning by bringing focus and discipline to the team. In addition, external inputs into team production by instructors or other peers may be affected by the conscientiousness of team members.====We cannot explore all potential mechanisms with the data we have available, but consider a subset of prominent candidates. We speak to indirect ability effects by controlling for the recent individual achievement of teammates, but focus our attention on probing the direct mechanisms. First, we test if conscientious students induce changes in their peers’ study behavior by investigating whether the positive impacts of exposure to conscientious peers persist when the student is reassigned to a new team; if individual effects are sustained, students are likely changing their own work habits. And, second, we explore whether conscientious teammates improve team functioning by assessing if effects are larger on more complex tasks requiring more team coordination. Our results provide moderate support for both channels: teammate conscientiousness positively affects ==== individual test achievement, suggesting peer personality affects study behavior, and the impacts of teammate conscientiousness are somewhat more evident on complex questions requiring the most group coordination, evidence of better teamwork.====In our study, we measure personality factors using the “Big Five” personality traits of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness. It is argued that this five-factor model can fully describe an individual's personality.==== Although similar ideas existed earlier, the “Big Five” model in its current form was motivated by Goldberg (1990) who categorized a near-exhaustive list of known personality traits into these five factors. Many similar analyses have followed. We summarize the model in colloquial terms in the below table adapted from Diener and Lucas (2020):====Our paper is most closely related to Golsteyn et al. (2019) who investigate peer personality effects on individual achievement in a business school. Studying teaching sections of up to 16 students, they find that peer persistence, which is likely highly correlated with peer conscientiousness, increases individual test performance by about 2% of a standard deviation, which is similar in magnitude to our estimated effect on team test performance. Our paper has important distinguishing features. We primarily consider team output rather than individual output, and our peer groups are teams of three that work together on joint tasks in class rather than larger teaching sections. This is an important distinction; the extent to which individuals are affected by teammates on a joint task has parallels with many employment settings, and contrasts with the “softer” influence of peers in larger groups on individual output explored by Golsteyn et al. (2019). However, the unified evidence of hard working peers exerting positive externalities on their peers emphasizes the importance of personality traits in social interactions. This conclusion is also supported by Shure (2017), who uses within-school across-cohort variation to show that peer conscientiousness is positively related to secondary school grades, and Bietenbeck (2020), who uses data from Project STAR to show that having motivated classmates improves contemporaneous reading achievement.====In a recent paper, Weidmann and Deming (2021) conduct a novel laboratory experiment to identify individual contributions to team production. “Team players”, individuals who consistently cause their team to outperform their team's predicted production based on individual skills, are found to be endowed with more social intelligence, but are no different in terms of IQ, personality, education, and gender, in comparison to other team members. Our study shares two important features with theirs – measuring team performance controlling for the task-specific skills of individual team members, and observing individuals in multiple teams – but a key difference across our settings is the extent of team interactions. In our paper, teams work together for a month rather than once in a laboratory; it is not surprising that we find that teammate personality matters for team performance given team members have interacted repeatedly and over an extended period.====Two factors separate our findings from a literature in psychology that explores correlational relationships between team personality composition and team performance. The randomization of individuals into teams in our setting allows us to identify causal effects of team composition rather than associations, and the availability of highly comparable measures of individual and team performance allows us to explore effects on team “value-added”, the production of the team controlling for the productive capacity of individual team members. Peeters et al. (2006), in a meta-analysis of this literature, find evidence of a positive association between team conscientiousness and team output, similar to the causal effect we identify, but they also report a positive relationship between team agreeableness and team performance, which we do not find. Bell (2007) also uses meta-analytic techniques to provide an overall assessment of the psychology literature exploring relationships between team composition and team performance. She also finds that team mean conscientiousness is positively associated with team performance, but only in field settings and not in laboratory settings. This important distinction helps explain the difference between our finding from the field and that of Weidmann and Deming discussed above from a laboratory experiment in which no personality factor was associated with being a “team player”.====There is an established literature investigating peer effects in educational settings. Several papers exploit random assignment to peer groups in college as is done in our paper. Much of this work considers the impacts of college roommates (Sacerdote, 2001; Zimmerman, 2003; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2006) and peers in military academies (Carrell et al., 2009; Lyle, 2009; Jones and Kofoed, 2020), while more recent studies consider college cohorts and classrooms (Booij et al., 2017; Feld and Zölitz, 2017; Hill, 2017; Brenoe and Zölitz, 2019). These papers provide evidence that peer ability, peer gender and peer race all affect individual behavior and decision-making in college; in other words, there are spillovers associated with fixed peer attributes in college.====A smaller set of papers in the peer effects literature speaks to the possibility of behavioral-type peer externalities that are more similar to the peer personality impacts studied in this paper. In the college environment, Eisenberg et al. (2014) find evidence of peer effects in binge drinking; Figlio (2007) uses a creative name-based approach to show that boys more likely to be disruptive in class exert negative externalities on their peers in high school; and, in an elementary school context, Carrell and Hoekstra (2010) show that students whose in-class behavior is poor due to their home environments negatively impact their classmates. To the extent that individual behavior is predicted by the “Big Five” personality characteristics we study, our paper adds to this evidence that in-class behavior affects peers.====Our paper also speaks to a large literature on the relationships between “Big Five” personality traits and individual academic achievement. The findings we report on the causal effects of ==== personality traits are similar to some of the associations between ==== personality characteristics and achievement reported in the psychology literature. For example, Noftle and Robins (2007) find that individual conscientiousness is a strong predictor of both high school and college GPA; they report unconditional correlations of 0.20–0.24 between measures of conscientiousness and high school GPA in some models, which are an order of magnitude larger than the causal effects we document for peer conscientiousness. Saying that, magnitudes can be difficult to compare across studies and environments, and the associations between own conscientiousness and test performance that we subsequently report in this paper in a directly comparable setting are similar in magnitude to our estimated effects of teammate conscientiousness. And a meta-analysis conducted by O'Connor and Paunonen (2007) not only finds this conscientiousness-achievement relationship, but also reports suggestive evidence that school performance is negatively correlated with extroversion and positively associated with openness; the latter relationships are in the same direction as the secondary effects we find for peer extroversion and peer openness. Taken as a whole, the personality traits associated with individual achievement appear to causally affect the performance of peers in similar ways.====In addition, evidence of personality spillovers is important for policy evaluation. Given the increasing empirical support that educational interventions improve socio-emotional skills (Dee and West, 2011; West et al., 2016), the potential for socio-emotional skills to be related to the personality factors we study, and that these impacts may ultimately be more persistent than the effects on test scores (Heckman et al., 2013), we underestimate the returns to policies if we do not incorporate positive externalities such as those found in our study into program evaluations.",The effect of teammate personality on team production,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001385,20 August 2022,2022,Research Article,67.0

In this paper, we investigate how the degree of downward nominal wage rigidity in U.S. labor markets has changed over time using job-level data from a nationally representative establishment-based compensation survey collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After defining two types of downward nominal rigidity (operative and potential) often used in macroeconomic models of business fluctuations, we employ three distinct methods to examine the magnitude of downward nominal rigidity in the U.S. labor market, whether each type of rigidity is more or less severe in the presence of negative economic shocks than in more normal economic times, and how the degree of rigidity changed as ==== trended downward. We find no evidence that the high degree of labor market distress during the Global Financial Crisis resulted in a change in the extent of potential downward rigidity in nominal wage changes, though we do observe a downward trend in potential rigidity as wage inflation fell over the broad stretch of our data. In contrast, we find that operative rigidity was both countercyclical and increased at lower rates of inflation. In addition, we find a much lower degree of both types of downward nominal rigidity at multi-year horizons.","Rigidity in wages has long been thought to affect the functioning of labor markets. Such rigidity can take different forms, with differing implications for unemployment and other aspects of economic performance. Rigidities could arise from explicit or implicit contracting, efficiency wages, fixed-length nominal wage agreements, menu costs in the wage-setting process, government regulations, or informational or behavioral factors.====One strand of the research on wage flexibility has focused on asymmetric rigidities in the nominal wage-setting process—most notably the downward nominal wage rigidity posited by Keynes (1936) and, later, Tobin (1972), who argued that downward nominal wage rigidity might lead to undesirable macroeconomic consequences at low levels of inflation and that to “grease the wheels of the labor market,” it would be optimal to target an inflation rate somewhat above zero.====With consumer price inflation often running well over 5 percent in the 1970s and early 1980s, such concerns were seen as mostly immaterial: The costs of inflation were viewed as clearly exceeding any potential benefits, and rarely would employers have had to resort to cutting nominal wage rates in order to reduce real wage rates. However, as inflation declined to 2 percent or less by the mid-1990s, the question of whether workers or firms resist nominal wage cuts—and the consequences for labor market performance—became increasingly relevant. Indeed, the possibility that nominal wages were downwardly rigid accorded with indications from a variety of surveys (Blinder and Choi, 1990; Bewley, 2002; Smith, 2015; Du Caju et al., 2015) that declines in real wages caused by price increases are more acceptable to workers than nominal wage cuts and that employers are often reluctant to cut nominal wages because, among other factors, they believe such cuts would damage worker morale.====Empirical research to assess the extent of downward nominal wage rigidity in actual wages initially focused on micro-level data from household surveys. For example, research by McLaughlin (1994), Lebow et al. (1995), and Kahn (1997) used individual-level wage changes constructed from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) to test for the presence of downward nominal rigidity and found limited supporting evidence, especially for hourly wage workers. However, concerns about the prevalence of measurement error in the wage changes constructed from these surveys (for example, Bound and Krueger, 1991; Gottschalk, 2005) led many to question the reliability of the findings from this research.====In response, other researchers turned to employer surveys, which are thought to suffer less from misreported wages (Wilson, 1999; Altonji and Devereux, 2000).==== These studies generally found a larger role for downward nominal wage rigidity. However, much of the research that has used firm-level data has been based on case studies or on samples of only a small number of firms, and thus seems of limited applicability to the U.S. economy as a whole. An exception is Lebow et al. (2003), who used the same nationally representative data set that we employ in this paper and found that downward nominal wage rigidity reduced the number of nominal wage cuts by about half over their sample period.====Some researchers have recently used administrative data from the unemployment insurance tax system or wage records from payroll processing firms to assess the presence of downward nominal wage rigidity.==== For example, Kurmann and McEntarfer (2019) and Jardim et al. (2019) used payroll tax records from Washington state, where the state unemployment insurance system requires employers to report both quarterly earnings and quarterly hours for each employee (thereby enabling the researchers to construct an hourly wage). Both sets of researchers found that roughly 20 percent of job stayers experienced nominal wage cuts over the sample period they study, while less than 10 percent had their earnings frozen.==== Meanwhile, Grigsby et al. (2021) used wage records from the payroll processing firm ADP and found that only 2 percent of workers experienced a reduction in their base wage in a given year, while 35 percent experienced no change in their base wage.====Despite the evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity in the United States, whether this rigidity has important macroeconomic consequences remains an open question. Many researchers find little evidence that this form of rigidity has had material consequences for the performance of the labor market, suggesting that employers can often find ways to adjust their labor costs without having to cut nominal wages. For example, Lebow et al. (2003) found only weak evidence of an effect of downward nominal wage rigidity on aggregate wages in a wage-price Phillips curve model, which they attributed partly to a tendency for employers to use benefits to offset the rigidity in nominal wages.==== Meanwhile, Elsby (2009) and Stüber and Beissinger (2012) provided evidence that firms respond to downward nominal wage rigidity by compressing the wage structure for other employees, effectively offsetting the effects of rigidity on aggregate wage growth. And, more recently, Kurmann and McEntarfer (2019) reported that the downward nominal wage rigidity apparent in nominal hourly wage rates is not evident in annual earnings, suggesting that employers respond to the downward rigidity in wages by reducing the hours worked by their employees.====Macroeconomic consequences may also depend on the extent to which downward nominal rigidity binds during periods of severe economic distress, such as the period during and after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09, when the unemployment rate reached 10 percent and price deflation was at times seen as a distinct possibility. On the one hand, employers who are disinclined to cut wages might implement company-wide wage freezes in a sharp economic downturn. On the other hand, the surveys conducted by Kahneman et al. (1986) and Bewley (1995) both suggested that employees find nominal wage cuts mostly unobjectionable if a firm is losing money.====However, the evidence on this from previous research is mixed. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), Daly et al. (2012) and Daly and Hobijn (2014) found a noticeable rise between 2007 and 2011 in the percentage of workers in the same job who reported no change in their wage relative to a year earlier, with the proportion of workers with no change in 2011 higher than in any period since the beginning of their sample period in 1983==== suggesting that employers were reluctant to cut wages despite the adverse demand shocks associated with the financial crisis. Using the same data, Jo (2021) found that the spike at zero has been countercyclical since 1979. In contrast, Elsby et al. (2016), using data on workers who had been with the same employer for at least a year, found that the size of the spike at zero increased only modestly during and shortly after the Global Financial Crisis, and was accompanied by a more pronounced rise in nominal wage cuts, suggesting an increase in the degree of wage flexibility.====A related question is how the extent of downward nominal rigidity has responded to the downtrend in overall wage (and price) inflation since the early 1980s. Gordon (1996, p.62) and Mankiw (1996, p.69), for example, argued that nominal rigidity would be less prevalent in environments of low inflation because workers’ aversion to nominal wage cuts would be reduced in an environment of price stability in which nominal wage declines were more common.====In this paper, we add to the evidence on these two questions of how downward nominal wage rigidity has changed over time using establishment-level data from a nationally representative compensation survey collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Using three distinct methods proposed in the literature to measure rigidity, we place a particular emphasis on how downward nominal rigidity varies over the business cycle and with overall wage inflation.====In addition, under some assumptions we can use our methods to assess both the extent to which actual wage changes were constrained by downward nominal wage rigidity (which we will refer to as “operative rigidity”); and whether there were behavioral changes on the part of employers and workers—notably, whether individual or employer norms toward nominal wage cuts respond to prolonged periods of low inflation or economic stress—that result in a change in the potential for downward nominal wage rigidity to bind (which we will refer to as “potential rigidity”). Put another way, we define potential rigidity as reflecting the frictions in the wage-setting system, while operative rigidity is the outcome of those frictions interacting with otherwise-desired wage changes. We then focus on the Global Financial Crisis and subsequent slow recovery to assess whether downward nominal wage rigidity is more or less common in the presence of severe negative economic shocks than in more normal economic times. We also examine how this rigidity evolved as inflation trended downward over our sample period.====As is the case with many earlier studies, we find a significant amount of downward nominal wage rigidity in the United States at a 12-month horizon, both in terms of the proportion of wage changes that were actually constrained by downward nominal wage rigidity and in the proportion potentially subject to such rigidity should the notional wage change fall below zero. Although one might have expected the costs of wage rigidity to be too burdensome to maintain in a sharp economic downturn, we find no evidence that the high degree of labor market distress during the Global Financial Crisis resulted in a change in the extent of potential downward rigidity in nominal wage changes. Additionally, one might expect firms to adapt to a generally lower level of inflation by more readily reducing nominal wage rates, and we do find a downward trend in our measures of potential rigidity as inflation fell over the broad stretch of our sample period. In contrast, we find that operative rigidity is both countercyclical and increases at lower rates of inflation. Finally, we also report evidence suggesting that a likely reason for the lack of macroeconomic consequences from downward nominal wage rigidity is that firms often take a multi-year view of labor costs when implementing their compensation practices.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset we use to conduct our analysis, provides some summary statistics, and discusses the pros and cons of using a job-focused survey of wages. Section 3 presents some simple histograms of the nominal wage change distribution for selected years in our sample. Section 4 describes the various estimators we use to examine properties of the wage change distribution for signs of downward nominal wage rigidity. Section 5 presents the results.

A key advantage of the data is that it provides precise measures of the length of job transitions and the tenure of job keepers, which we show is important to understand the ==== of earnings. Consistent with the previous literature, we find that newly created jobs (new hires) earnings are significantly more sensitive to aggregate unemployment than those of continuing jobs (job keepers). However, and contrary to recent evidence for the US, the larger sensitivity of the earnings of new jobs is a feature of both job-to-job movements as well as hires within the first year of non-employment, transitions for which wage sensitivity is less likely to be driven by cyclicality in the quality of new jobs. We also find a relevant degree of heterogeneity in the cyclical response of earnings among job keepers, with earnings being less cyclical for workers with longer tenure. These results highlight that the precise length of tenure and job transitions is relevant to correctly understand the cyclicality of wages. Our results are robust to controlling for changes in the workers’ relative wage position, suggesting that earnings cyclicality is not only an artifact of the behavior of job transitions inside and outside the firm.","The cyclical behavior of real wages, which has direct implications for the dynamics of aggregate employment and output in response to shocks, has justifiably been a central topic in the macroeconomics and labor economics literature for decades. Typically, aggregate wage measures appeared to suggest that wages fluctuated little over the cycle or even that they moved countercyclically, a notion that seemed consistent with traditional Keynesian models with wage rigidities.====However, a large literature starting from Bils (1985) has shown, using data for the US and Europe, that individual-level information can provide valuable insights that are lost with aggregate wage indices.==== A central finding in this literature is that the behavior of aggregate wages not only reflects the evolution of individual wages but also changes in the skill composition of aggregate employment along the business cycle. These changes in the composition of the employment pool can dampen or even revert the aggregate effects of the changes in worker-level wages, leading to relevant differences between the inferences derived from wage indices and those that come from the actual wages of individuals. In particular, estimates of wage cyclicality using individual-level data are typically larger than those from aggregate indicators.====An important additional insight from this literature is that the wage cyclicality of new hires is substantially larger than that of workers that keep their job. This finding is consistent with the ideas in Pissarides (2009), who argues that the relevant measure of wage flexibility comes from the behavior of the present discounted value of wages of new hires rather than from overall wages. Under that interpretation, the wages of new hires are associated with the relevant marginal cost of labor for firms. Therefore, wage flexibility among new hires will facilitate labor adjustment along the cycle.====However, Gertler and Trigari (2009) and Hagedorn and Manovsk (2013) argue that existing empirical studies may be picking up the procyclical nature of the match quality of job-to-job transitions rather than the actual cyclicality of individual wages. In this line of argument, recent work by Gertler et al. (2020) uses higher frequency data for the US to separate new hires coming from job-to-job transitions from new hires that come out of the unemployment pool. They find that while the wage cyclicality of workers experiencing job-to-job transitions is quite large, the wage cyclicality of new hires coming out of non-employment is similar to that of keepers. Under their interpretation, it is not that wages themselves are procyclical but rather that their apparent cyclicality is driven by the cyclical pattern in the quality of job transitions. Therefore, real wages in new employment relationships tend to move up (down) when unemployment is low (high), not because wages for a given job increase (fall), but because direct transitions towards higher-quality jobs become more (less) frequent and job gains from transitions become larger (smaller). This affects the estimated response of wages among workers that move across jobs directly –which are more likely to represent voluntary movements up a job ladder towards better jobs– but does not change the response of workers who transition through unemployment –whose movements have no systematic relationship with quality improvements, as on average they are likely to return to a similar job.====This paper contributes to this literature by using tax records for a census of workers and firms in Chile between 2005 and 2016 to address in detail the heterogeneity of labor earnings cyclicality across different types of employment relationships (ERs). A relevant advantage of our data is that it allows us to identify the ERs at a monthly frequency. This provides a detailed characterization of the duration of continuing jobs and the length of job transitions associated with new hires, and expands the previous literature in a relevant dimension. While a significant number of papers have lumped all new hires as a unique category that compares to job keepers, we, as in Gertler et al. (2020) or Lydon and Lozej (2018), can separate direct job-to-job transitions from hires out of non-employment. However, we can provide a more precise characterization of hires from non-employment by identifying the precise duration of their transitions, arguing that the length of the non-employment spell is relevant for the behavior of earnings. Similarly, we can exploit the heterogeneity in tenure among job keepers. Detailed information on the within-firm earnings distribution allows us to build proxies that control for transitions across job positions, and to explore heterogeneity in the cyclicality of wages across workers and firms of different types. Importantly, our data has information on the worker’s complete labor earnings, including wages and other forms of labor compensation. We think that using total earnings provides a better measure of the relevant cost of labor and its adjustment across the business cycle.====We highlight three main results that are important for the recent debate on the relevant margins of wage adjustment throughout the business cycle.====First, and in line with previous literature, we find that the earnings of newly created jobs (new hires) are significantly more sensitive to aggregate unemployment than those of continuing jobs (job keepers). However, contrary to the recent evidence provided in Gertler et al. (2020) for the US, the larger sensitivity of new jobs earnings is a feature of both job-to-job transitions as well as hires from relatively short spells of non-employment of up to two quarters.====Second, we find a significant degree of heterogeneity within continuing jobs. While the earnings of long-tenure job keepers have the lowest degree of cyclicality, the earnings of short-tenure workers have a significant degree of cyclicality.====Third, we find that results are robust to changes in the worker’s relative earnings, suggesting that the cyclicality of earnings is not driven by job improvements or demotions (either within the firm or towards a new firm). Moreover, the overall qualitative patterns hold across worker and firm characteristics. We also find that the overall cyclicality of earnings is decreasing on the worker’s age and income, as well as on firm size, a result largely driven by composition, and that the earnings of male workers are significantly more procyclical than those of women regardless of employment status.====As a bottom line, our results support the notion that individual earnings in Chile are procyclical, with magnitudes that fall within the boundaries of estimates found for other countries, and that this result is not solely driven by the cyclicality of direct job transitions but also by job transitions with relatively short non-employment spells and by workers with short tenures. Moreover, while we confirm the relative stability of wages for continuing jobs, the richness of the data allows to uncover interesting heterogeneity patterns in wage cyclicality depending on job tenure. These findings suggest that workers earnings are flexible, allowing the labor market to accommodate aggregate shocks.====A final contribution of the paper is to expand the scope of the literature, typically focused on data for the US and Europe, with data from an emerging economy. Chile is an interesting case study on the cyclicality of labor compensation for several reasons. First, it is a small open economy with relevant exposure to relative price shocks. In that context, the flexibility of wages plays a key role in the labor market’s ability to adjust to a volatile environment. Second, Chile has a high level of average turnover by international standards, with large job creation/destruction rates at the firm level and short employment spells/large number of job transitions for individual workers (Albagli et al., 2017). This suggests the existence of a very active labor market with a large degree of mobility. Our estimates suggest that earnings cyclicality in Chile is in line with estimated cyclicality in countries as Portugal, but seems significantly larger than the values estimated for other countries like Germany.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and the baseline results for earnings cyclicality for different categories of existing jobs and new hires. Section 4 explores heterogeneity in the cyclical response of wages across firms and workers of different types.

Specifically, a 2011 revision of the marriage law changed the property division rule upon divorce from an equal division to a title-based division under certain circumstances, leading to a loss in intrahousehold property ownership for some women. The main results show that the loss of housing property ownership deteriorates wives’ outside option, lowers the probability of divorce and increases the likelihood that they will remain in a low quality marriage. Further effects include an inducement for the husband’s parents to move in, who bring more traditional gender norms to the core family, become involved in household decision-making and thus influence the young couple’s behaviors. Consequently, women are less likely to work in the labor market and shoulder a greater share of chores between themselves and their husbands. Heterogeneity analyses show that higher property values are associated with larger ","Economists have long been interested in intrahousehold decision-making and resource allocation, and the theoretical frameworks have progressed from unitary to bargaining models. In a standard bargaining model, two spouses with different preferences bargain over resource allocation and other family decisions. In particular, each spouse faces a threat point which is the utility he/she would gain in the case of divorce. As each spouse’s potential opportunities and endowments outside the marriage can shift the threat point, this can cause the intrahousehold bargaining power to change. Consequently, family decisions and well-being within the marriage are affected by each spouse’s predictions of their status outside the marriage.====An extensive literature has been established to examine the bargaining process, and intrahousehold bargaining power has been found to affect a household’s total assets, consumption of male-/female-preferred goods, family violence, women’s physical and mental health, labor supply, time spent on chores, subjective well-being, and children’s health and educational outcomes (e.g. Adam, Hoddinott, Ligon, Brown, 2009, Doss, 2006, Doss, 2013, Heath, Tan, 2020, Qian, 2008, Stevenson, Wolfers, 2006, Voena, 2015).==== Previous studies have developed various proxies of intrahousehold bargaining power, and women’s individual ownership of property (including land, housing property, dowry and a broader range of other assets) has been shown to be important, as it is a direct indicator of the wife’s outside option.====This study investigates the effect of an exogenous change in the intrahousehold housing property division rule in China in 2011 on intrahousehold bargaining power through a shift in outside options. Previously, the rule for dividing housing property upon divorce was either an equal division or it was ambiguous. The reform in 2011 established a new division rule whereby property rights are protected by the registered names and contributions at time of purchase. As this exogenous change in the law affects couples whose home is registered under one spouse’s name the most, while those who are jointly registered are not likely to be affected, it thus provides an opportunity to apply a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the causal effect of a change in individual intrahousehold property ownership. This study focuses on the outcomes under several aspects of family structure including divorce, fertility and co-residence with the husband’s parents and also examines the effects on women’s labor market supply.====As divorce typically defines the threat point in the bargaining model, this study is related to the literature examining the effect of divorce law reforms on household divorce decisions. Numerous studies, including Gonzlez and Viitanen (2009); Mechoulan (2006); Wolfers (2006), have estimated the effect of a change in the divorce regime from consent divorce to no-fault unilateral divorce in the United States and Europe, and they generally find that the regime change reduced the cost of divorce and increased the divorce rate. This study contributes to the literature by examining the effect on bargaining status due to a divorce law change that creates unequal shocks, as the change in the cost of divorce is different for the two spouses. Moreover, this study examines the divorce decision from the more fine-grained perspective of individual-level marital dynamics instead of the aggregate state-level divorce rate that is widely used in the literature. The use of micro data is beneficial in the context since it allows us to relate divorce results to other family and individual behaviors that are difficult to observe in aggregate data, and to conduct heterogeneity analysis, so that we could not only examine the divorce level change, but achieve a broader understanding of how and on whom the divorce law reform takes effects as well.====This study is also related to the emerging literature studying the causal relation between intrahousehold bargaining and other aspects of family formation such as fertility decisions and intergenerational effects. Although the fertility decision is one of the most important outcomes of bargaining within a household, as men and women may show different preferences over the number and gender of children, the research is limited in spite of the rich literature on child development. Among the few existing studies, Harari (2019) finds that an improvement in women’s inheritance rights leads them to postpone marriage and childbirth. The existing literature also seldom relates women’s bargaining power to intergenerational interactions within the marital household. One exception is Mookerjee (2019), who finds that an improvement in women’s inheritance rights in India have empowered their participation in decision-making at the expense of the older generation and reduced the probability of living with parents-in-law. Examining these aspects of family structure are useful because they are among the most important real-world decisions to be made within a family, and these decisions provide insight into individual preferences and the intrahousehold bargaining process. In addition, as these decisions are also closely related to the well-being of women as well as other family members, their analysis can inform the evaluation of family-friendly policies.====This study also investigates the impact of intrahousehold bargaining on women’s labor supply which is typically considered as an individual decision in labor supply models but is often jointly determined together with family members in reality. Despite an extensive literature, the effects of bargaining power on female labor supply are mixed, and tend to vary according to cultural context. In the US, Chiappori et al. (2002) finds that divorce laws deemed favorable to women (regarding unilateral/mutual consent divorce, community property/common law, etc.) lead to a decrease in female labor supply and an increase in male labor supply in terms of hours worked through the standard income effect. In contrast, however, some studies of India (Field, Pande, Rigol, Schaner, Moore, 2021, Heath, Tan, 2020) find the opposite effect, with a strengthening of women’s bargaining power through inheritance regulation or financial training inducing women to enter the labor market, especially into high-paying jobs. They interpret this to be the result of traditional gender norms that inhibit women from working outside, and their willingness to participate in the labor market to gain more income once they are autonomous. Meanwhile, studies of Chile (Claudia Martnez, 2013) and Mexico (Hoehn-Velasco and Penglase, 2021) find a limited labor supply response to divorce legislation. Though the literature is ambiguous, it has emphasized the importance of culture as an important factor in the relationship between intrahousehold bargaining power and labor market behaviors.====In view of cultural and social context, China has unique attributes, with social mores deeply rooted in Confucian ethics emphasizing patriarchy, respect for parents, and family harmony while the divorce rate has been surging in recent years. Despite this apparent incongruity, there are few studies on the relation between individual property rights and family outcomes in China and those that do tend to focus on the well-being of either men or women as individuals or the behaviors of the unmarried. The present study is most similar to Zang (2020), who finds that women’s loss of property ownership due to the same marriage law reform studied here harms married women in terms of their satisfaction with life, confidence in the future, and the amount of time doing housework or market work. Although that study focuses mainly on women’s subjective well-being, Sun and Zhang (2020) find that the same law has alleviated assortativeness on the original family background among the unmarried. Further, Wang (2014), examining the effect of changes in individual property rights due to a privatization of state-owned housing in China in 1994, finds that an individual-level transfer of property rights strengthens intrahousehold bargaining power towards male-favored goods consumption and time spent on chores among both men and women.====The main findings of the current study are as follows. First, women’s loss of intrahousehold property rights leads to a sizable decline in the probability of divorce one year later and a moderate but still important decline even in the long run (a decline of 1.6% compared to the control mean of 3.1% seven years after the policy change). This implies a lower marriage quality among the treatment group, and this is supported by the findings on fertility choice, for those affected by the reform were less likely to have children immediately after the policy came into force, though a catch-up effect is observed in the longer term. Second, there is a non-negligible and long-lasting increase in the probability of co-residence with the husband’s parents among treated women (an increase of 6.8% over the control mean of 29.4% seven years after the policy change). While the husband’s parents typically move in to help shoulder the household duties, they also bring traditional gender norms to the nuclear family and thus potentially change the young couple’s behaviors or even participate in the decision-making process. Third, possibly due to the stronger exposure to traditional gender roles, a negative policy effect is found on women’s labor market work status, though there is little effect observed on women’s hours of labor supply. Heterogeneity analysis results suggest that young women and women living in a house of high value are affected by the division rule change more.====These results indicate that the marriage law reform has hurt marriage quality on average, and the deterioration in women’s bargaining power led by the policy change is stable and persistent. Since the reform has caused a loss in treated women’s intrahousehold property ownership without changing the total amount of household property, this study provides further evidence that the unitary model does not adequately capture household decision-making. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of taking family structure into consideration in understanding the intrahousehold bargaining process.====One potential threat to the identification is that the control group can be affected by the reform, and thus the DID estimate will be biased. It is possible since 15%-20% of the control group households are observed to change the house registration to be under only the husbands’ names after the reform, so women in those households would also experience a property loss. Control group households can also be affected through indirect channels, such as siblings’ spillover effect, the change in the remarriage benefit, and the labor market equilibrium adjustment. To address this concern, we provide a detailed discussion of each channel, show that most channels are likely to lead to an underestimation of the treatment effect, and conduct a series of quantitative bound analyses to prove the size of the underestimate is reasonably small.====The contribution of this study is four-fold. First, it emphasizes family structure outcomes, starting from the direct impact of the change in property ownership on divorce, then extending the analysis to other aspects of family structure, and drawing implications on the bargaining process by investigating potential mechanisms. Particular attention is given to the change in intergenerational interactions and its impact on other household decisions, which are important in the Confucian context, yet rarely discussed to date. Second, the study exploits variations from an exogenous change in legislation to avoid the difficulty in handling the endogeneity with more individual dependent bargaining power proxies such as the amounts of personal income and a woman’s dowry. Third, the study adopts an alternative method and dataset to validate the study, which is further supported by several additional tests to confirm the robustness of the main findings. Lastly, the study broadens the literature on intrahousehold bargaining by contributing evidence from China, which may also provide insight into other East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background of regulatory reform of property division upon divorce in China and background on marriage and housing property in the country. Section 3 discusses the identification strategy and the main data source, while Section 4 presents the main empirical results.

Finally, using different estimation models, we investigate whether the effects vary by gender, age, birth year, and employment status.","Job satisfaction is often viewed as an indicator of the utility associated with work. Combining this interpretation with the assumption that individuals become trade union members if the associated benefits exceed the resulting costs, we can expect trade union members to exhibit higher job satisfaction than individuals who choose not to become union members. Early empirical studies, such as by Freeman (1978) and Borjas (1979), do not observe the predicted positive correlation and have sparked an intense debate, generating a multitude of investigations. Most subsequent cross-sectional analyses report a negative relationship. If employing panel data or accounting for the endogeneity of union membership, relatively little evidence for a negative impact of union membership remains. However, the theoretical expectation of a positive correlation rarely finds empirical support.====The vast majority of studies, for example, considered in the meta-analysis by Laroche (2016) and the surveys by Artz and Heywood (2021), Hammer and Avgar (2005), and Goerke (2021), are based on data from the UK and the US. Given the specificity of their industrial relations system, we cannot easily generalise the findings. Meanwhile, the relationship between union membership and job satisfaction for other economies has not been well documented. Moreover, analyses that can truly identify causal effects are rare.====In this paper, we fill part of the research lacunae implicitly described above. As our first contribution, we comprehensively analyse the linkage between trade union membership and job satisfaction for Germany, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel from 1985 to 2019. Germany is an interesting subject of research because trade unions play an important role. They have almost eight million members. Net union density is around 16% and has declined substantially over the last decades (OECD and AIAS, 2021). Moreover, the linkage between collective bargaining coverage and union membership is much weaker in Germany than in, for example, the US, indicating different incentives to become a trade union member. In addition, co-determination at the firm level via works councils plays a vital role. Therefore, we provide additional insights on the function of bargaining coverage and co-determination for the relationship between union membership and job satisfaction. As our second contribution, we present an innovative approach using a time-variant instrumental variable (IV) to account for the possible endogeneity of union membership. In particular, we rely on the concurrent strength of unions at the sectoral and regional level. Third, we conduct a comprehensive subgroup analysis and investigate whether the relationship between union membership and job satisfaction varies by gender, age, birth year, and employment status.====We document a negative correlation between trade union membership and job satisfaction in Germany in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models. We do not discern a statistically significant relationship in Fixed Effects (FE) specifications, unless we separate between individuals who join the trade union and those who leave it. Adding information on collective bargaining coverage or co-determination at the workplace for a subset of years clarifies that the above-mentioned correlations are not determined by such labour market institutions. Specifications based on time-variant exogenous variations in a trade union membership suggest the absence of any causal effect of union membership on job satisfaction. Although we cannot directly prove the exogeneity assumption and there might be concerns about the violation of the exclusion restriction, we corroborate our key finding in various robustness checks. For instance, instead of using the contemporaneous IV, we apply the lagged IV, which may be more exogenous. We also aggregate the union density at different levels, which allows us to consider the possible spillover effect of our IV. The application of the ==== strategy suggests that our main finding holds if the IV affects job satisfaction partly through other channels. Finally, we find stronger correlations in OLS models for female, older, and part-time employees. However, estimates from FE and IV models are mostly statistically insignificant. Therefore, subgroup analyses yield qualitatively similar results as for the whole sample.====The further paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional background, clarifies what effects of union membership on job satisfaction may be expected in Germany, and summarises the extant empirical evidence. In Section 3, we introduce the data and describe the empirical model. Section 4 presents the findings. Section 5 concludes the paper.

We model wages at various points across the career as a function of the mandated number of months of continuing coverage at labor market entrance. More generous mandated continuing coverage at labor market entrance causes an initial wage decline of 1% that reverses after five years in the labor market, leading to higher wages later in the career. In particular, wage increases are observable up to 30 years after labor market entrance. We provide suggestive evidence that increased job mobility early in the career is a mechanism for observed wage effects.","Labor market entrance is a critically important period for establishing wage profiles (Topel and Ward, 1992; von Wachter, 2010; Gardecki and Neumark, 1998). During this period, workers gain skills and transition to higher paying jobs and/or jobs that offer a better worker-firm-specific match, which sets their wage course for their career. Features of the labor market that stifle job mobility can persistently lower wages. For example, studies show that workers who enter the labor market during a period of reduced aggregate demand have persistently, but not permanently, lower wage and non-wage compensation (Schwandt and Von Wachter, 2019; Kahn, 2010; Oreopoulos et al., 2012; Kondo, 2015; Genda et al., 2010; Maclean, 2014; Altonji et al., 2016; Arellano-Bover, 2020).====This paper studies the effect of regulations that compel private insurers to include continuing coverage in insurance plans on wages at various points across the career in the United States. Within the U.S., insurance coverage is tightly linked with employment, and firms are the main source of coverage among non-elderly adults. Following the continuing coverage regulations, many firms that offer insurance must include continuing coverage in their benefit packages. Economic models of mandated benefits imply that if workers value the benefit, firms will reduce wages paid to offset benefit costs. The mandates we study allow separating workers and their dependents to maintain access to employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) for up to 20 months after leaving a job. These mandates, passed by states in the 1970s and 1980s, reflect the first government regulation of continuing coverage in the U.S.====Continuing coverage is plausibly valuable to younger workers since this benefit facilitates job mobility, in turn promoting skill accumulation and improved worker-job matching and thus higher wages. Because younger workers are more likely to change jobs than older workers (Groot and Verberne, 1997),==== younger workers are potentially identifiable to firms. The ability to identify workers likely to value the benefit allows firms to pass costs to this group through lower wages (Lahey, 2012). With this background, we expect an initial negative relationship between mandated continuing coverage at labor market entrance and wages (as firms reduce wages to offset benefit costs), which will become positive after workers can benefit from increased job mobility and improved job matches in early career.====As discussed earlier in this section, several previous studies have examined and documented the importance of labor market shocks early in the career. For example, Arellano-Bover (2020) shows unemployment rates (which measure aggregate demand) faced at ages 18–25 (typical labor market entry ages) are more important for worker skill measures at ages 39–59 than unemployment rates measured at ages 26–30 and 31–35 (i.e., ages after typical labor market entrance). In our setting, the labor market entry conditions (we focus on continuing coverage mandates and not unemployment rates) and the subsequent evolution of those conditions (i.e., continuing coverage mandates) are arguably even more important because the change in the mandate is permanent (i.e., no states repeal their mandates) and persistently impact workers.====We draw a panel of workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and estimate two-way fixed-effects regressions to study continuing coverage mandate effects on wages measured at various points across the career. The NLSY79 is ideal for our research as the dataset tracks workers from labor market entrance through mid-career and has information on wages, job changes, and cumulative number of jobs, and detailed worker demographics. The time period in which our sample entered the labor market, 1973 to 1991, coincides with the initial roll-out of U.S. states’ continuing coverage mandates. Twenty-six states implemented a continuing coverage mandate, and several states increased the generosity of existing mandates. This near-ideal timing of a cohort of workers entering the labor market and substantial legislative action by states offers a unique opportunity to study how the ability to increase job mobility early in the career impacts wages. Using the NLSY79 is also beneficial as we examine a time period before the large-scale movement toward firm self-insurance in the U.S. Self-insured firms in the U.S. are insulated from state-level insurance regulations through the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). During the period when members of our sample entered the labor market, just 8% of firms were self-insured (McDonnell et al., 1986).====We find an initial decline in wages for new labor market entrants attributable to mandated continuing coverage: an additional month of continuing coverage eligibility reduces wages by 1% in the first five years in the labor market. Wages increase with work experience for workers subject to these mandates at labor market entrance. After ten years in the labor market, wages are 1% higher with each additional month of mandated continuing coverage at labor market entrance, and this effect persists through mid-career before dissipating by 30 years.====We provide suggestive evidence that increased job mobility—proxied by the propensity to change jobs and cumulative number of jobs held—is a potential mechanism for the observed wage effects. The mobility finding mirrors reductions in job lock documented in previous work using samples of the working-age males and exploiting the same source of variation that we leverage (Gruber and Madrian, 1994). We are the first study to show that policies that promote job mobility during an important career development stage have lasting effects on wages.",Government regulation and wages: Evidence from continuing coverage mandates,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001269,31 July 2022,2022,Research Article,73.0

Combining several data sets on workers who acquired skills in ==== and training (VET), we quantify each channel, allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in ability. All three skills increase productivity, yet they affect job destruction rates differentially. While manual skills are associated with lower job destruction, interpersonal and cognitive skills have the opposite effect. Focusing on low-ability workers, we then estimate the value of VET. Through VET, wages increase up to 10% and unemployment drops by over 50%. Low-ability workers thus have particularly large benefits from acquiring manual skills because they increase wages and shield from unemployment.","Substantial changes in the demand for interpersonal, cognitive, and manual skills observed over recent decades (Beaudry, Green, Sand, 2016, Deming, 2017, Lindenlaub, 2017, Roys, Taber, 2019) have had far-reaching consequences for workers’ labour market outcomes such as wages and employment patterns. While the effect of multidimensional skills on wages, wage growth and job mobility has been extensively studied (Guvenen, Kuruscu, Tanaka, Wiczer, 2020, Ingram, Neumann, 2006, Lise, Postel-Vinay, 2020, Roys, Taber, 2019, Sanders, Taber, 2012), far less is known about how different skills affect unemployment. Understanding the link between skills and unemployment as well as how it interacts with other labour market outcomes is key both for workers who decide which skills to acquire and for policy makers who design education curricula.====In this paper, we investigate how skills affect labour market outcomes through four channels: direct productivity effects (Beaudry, Green, Sand, 2016, Deming, 2017), complementarity in firms’ demand for different skills (Weinberger, 2014), differential risk of job destruction (Balsmeier, Woerter, 2019, Taber, Vejlin, 2020), and the cost of unemployment which can reflect different skill depreciation rates (Edin, Gustavsson, 2008, Nakajima, 2012). We distinguish between three different skill types - interpersonal, cognitive, and manual - and three different labour market outcomes - unemployment, wages, and labour market transitions.====We present a search and matching model to examine how, through these four channels, skills jointly shape workers’ welfare in equilibrium. We focus on workers who acquired their skills in vocational education and training (VET). Since the VET skill content is regulated through education curricula and standardised exams, we can directly measure workers’ acquired interpersonal, cognitive, and manual skills. In our set-up, workers differ in their unobserved ability and their acquired multidimensional skills. We then estimate the value of VET and the skills it confers for low-ability workers and discuss how this value arises.====We take our model to the data using the Swiss setting, where two thirds of a cohort enrol in VET. We have detailed information on labour market outcomes and skills of workers from 2004 to 2009. Our skills data comes from the Berufsinformationszentrum (BIZ), a career-counselling centre run by the Swiss government. The BIZ provides a detailed list of skills used in each of a total of 220 vocational occupations, grouping skills into three broad categories: interpersonal, cognitive, and manual. For labour market outcomes we use the SESAM survey which merges the Swiss Labour Force Survey, a representative panel, with administrative data on employment histories, unemployment benefits, and wages. We match the BIZ skills to the SESAM survey using the 5-digit occupational code of the learned occupation (i.e. the occupation in which a worker received his vocational education).====We take advantage of our rich data set to account for possible correlation between unobserved ability and occupational choice. First, we limit our analysis to workers who have obtained a VET degree as their highest education level. These workers tend to come from the intermediate and lower parts of the ability distribution, in contrast to workers who continue their education after completing VET. This restriction ensures that all workers in the sample differ primarily in their acquired skill bundles, while having limited heterogeneity in unobserved ability. Second, we control for the observed occupation-specific academic requirement index developed by Stalder (2011) which classifies occupations by high, intermediate, or low requirement. We show that this measure is a valid proxy for workers’ average academic ability level on the occupational level. It enables us to disentangle the effects of ==== by meeting academic requirements of the training occupation from the effects of ==== on labour market outcomes. Variation within and across occupation clusters allows us to identify the model parameters using the Simulated Method of Moments.====Our estimation and simulation results offer the following insights. First, we find that all three skills have positive effects on productivity and wages, although to a different extent. Manual skills have the largest effect on productivity (at 1.24 Swiss francs per hour for an additional manual skill), followed by interpersonal and cognitive skills (at 1.15 and 0.59 Swiss francs per hour and skill, respectively).==== We also estimate a substantial productivity premium in occupations with intermediate and high academic requirement levels (of 5.14 and 13.16 Swiss francs an hour, respectively). The selection role of the academic requirement helps explain the relative ranking of productivity effects of skills, which may appear surprising at first sight. Occupations with high interpersonal and cognitive skills tend to require a high academic level. Hence, large productivity (and wage) gains accrue from meeting the high academic level rather than from acquiring interpersonal and cognitive skills ====. Second, our simulation results reveal that skill-specific job destruction greatly affects workers’ welfare through its impact on transitions into unemployment. Skill-specific job destruction also has an impact on wages, albeit a small one. This result highlights the importance of analysing different labour market outcomes jointly and using a combined measure of workers’ welfare. Finally, we quantify the skill-specific cost of unemployment, which is largest for cognitive and interpersonal skills. This cost drives down reservation wages of workers with cognitive and interpersonal skills, which makes them exit unemployment slightly faster.====The model set-up also allows us to shed light on the value of VET and the skills it confers. In a further analysis we focus on low-ability workers with and without a VET degree. We estimate wage returns to VET of around 4% to 10%. Workers’ welfare, however, increases by 50% to 80% because of a second and far more important channel: VET benefits workers through higher job arrival and lower job destruction rates. By improving labour market transitions, VET thus decreases the unemployment rate faced by low-ability workers by one-half. In addition, VET leads to an increase in low-ability workers’ reservation wages. This suggests that their low unemployment rate does not come at the cost of accepting low-paying jobs. This second analysis further pinpoints how labour market outcomes other than wages reveal crucial information about workers’ welfare.====Our paper offers important insights into the multimensionality of skills. Our findings reveal that workers with low ability maximise their welfare when acquiring manual and - to a lesser extent - cognitive skills. Occupations which confer and use many manual skills pay higher wages and shield workers better from the risk of unemployment. Low-ability workers should thus select into manual-skill-intensive occupations. Workers with higher ability, however, should select into occupations which have a high academic requirement level and thus pay substantial wage premia. Only a small fraction of high-academic-requirement occupations use manual skills, while most of these occupations use cognitive and interpersonal skills. Workers with higher ability may therefore find acquiring cognitive and interpersonal skills more beneficial.====Our findings suggest that a general push towards acquiring more cognitive (or interpersonal) skills will not make all workers better off. Instead, our results speak to Roys and Taber (2019), who find that manual skills remain important for low-ability workers. When choosing which skills to acquire, workers should thus not simply focus on which skills afford highest wages, but take their own ability type into account. Similarly, policy makers who design education curricula should be well aware that firms exhibit strong heterogeneity in their demand for different types of skills and academic requirements. There remains scope for training in manual skills, in particular for workers with lower ability.====This paper ties into two strands of the literature. First, our paper relates to the growing body of research on the specificity of human capital and returns to heterogeneous skills. Recent contributions suggest that the number of years of education alone is not a sufficient measure of skill and propose alternative measures based on observed characteristics of jobs held by workers (Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003, Gathmann, Schönberg, 2010, Geel, Mure, Backes-Gellner, 2011, Ingram, Neumann, 2006, Kambourov, Manovskii, 2009, Lazear, 2009, Lise, Postel-Vinay, 2020, Poletaev, Robinson, 2008, Rinawi, Backes-Gellner, 2021) or workers’ observed initial abilities (Guvenen, Kuruscu, Tanaka, Wiczer, 2020, Lindqvist, Vestman, 2011, Lise, Postel-Vinay, 2020). A general finding is that individuals move to occupations with similar skill requirements and wages are closely related to skills. Second, it contributes to our understanding of how vocational education affects labour market outcomes. Vocational education is associated with facilitating school-to-work transitions and low youth unemployment (Dolado, 2015, Eichhorst, Rodríguez-Planas, Schmidl, Zimmermann, 2015, Plug, Groot, 1998, Ryan, 2001, Zimmermann, Biavaschi, Eichhorst, Giulietti, Kendzia, Muravyev, Pieters, Rodríguez-Planas, Schmidl, et al., 2013). However, evidence on longer-term labour market outcomes of vocational education is more scarce and more mixed (Adda, Dustmann, Meghir, Robin, 2013, Balestra, Backes-Gellner, 2017, Dearden, McIntosh, Myck, Vignoles, 2002, Hanushek, Schwerdt, Woessmann, Zhang, 2017, Kautz, Heckman, Diris, Ter Weel, Borghans, 2014, Rinawi, Backes-Gellner, 2021).====Our paper differs from these studies in two important aspects. First, our empirical analysis of labour market outcomes uses a simple search and matching model, in which labour market outcomes are analysed as equilibrium outcomes of the demand and supply of multidimensional skills. This allows us to quantify through which channels skills impact labour market outcomes beyond wages and to provide novel evidence on how differences in unemployment rates across skills arise. Our simple model is inspired by the search and matching frameworks developed by Flinn and Mullins (2015) (FM) on workers with different schooling levels and the recent contribution by Lise and Postel-Vinay (2020) (LP) who study wage growth, skill accumulation and depreciation over the life-cycle of workers characterised by multidimensional skills. Our labour market model features almost the same transmission channels (productivity, unemployment cost and job destruction) as FM if the schooling level was replaced by our multidimensional skills vector. However, our focus and analyses are different from FM and more closely related to LP. Like LP, we focus on workers with interpersonal, cognitive, and manual skills. Our analysis also differs from LP in that we (i) abstract from life-cycle dynamics and (ii) investigate how multidimensional skills affect unemployment and labour market transitions. We include skill-specific costs of unemployment and differential job destruction as additional channels for skills to impact labour market outcomes. These additional two channels are key in explaining the large differences observed in unemployment rates and reservation wages across different occupation groups.====Second, we contribute to the study of labour market outcomes of VET workers.==== We distinguish different occupations according to their level of interpersonal, cognitive, and manual skills as well as their academic requirement. This refined analysis provides new insights into the channels through which interpersonal, cognitive and manual skills affect labour market outcomes and their individual impact. We highlight that not all occupations confer the same returns in terms of wages and, more importantly, employment prospectives.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains the institutional setting in Switzerland and describes the data. Section 3 presents empirical evidence on selection into occupations and on labour market outcomes. Section 4 introduces a simple search and matching model with heterogeneous workers. Section 5 outlines our structural estimation procedure and discusses identification. Section 6 presents the structural estimation results. Section 7 uses the estimated model and simulations to shed light on how skills affect labour market outcomes and quantifies the value of VET for low-ability workers.

Lower mortality is thought to raise expected returns to the investment by increasing the expected total lifetime productive gains from the labour market, and also the horizon over which benefits from earlier investments in human capital could be enjoyed (e.g., Galor and Weil 1999, Soares 2005, De la Croix and Licandro 1999, Cervellati and Sunde 2005, Hazan 2012). To test the theory, many empirical studies estimate the relationship between mortality and education outcomes.==== Particularly, in a developing country context, several recent studies exploit regional variations of various health conditions and provide causal evidence for the effects of life expectancy and mortality risk on decisions related to human capital investments. They also demonstrate that the scale of adverse effects of mortality risk is crucially sensitive to the timing at which the risk is presented to the individuals (e.g., Fortson 2011, Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney 2009).====In this work, I shift away from a conventional focus on changes in medical-related mortality risk, namely, medical innovations, infectious diseases, or epidemiological transition. Instead, I examine the implications of mortality risk that is resulted from the usage of warfare weaponry and other similar materials capable of terminating lives.==== Mortality risk derived from warfare weaponry is distinct from that of general health-related risk in two main ways. First, it is a source of mortality risk that is capable of shortening one's lifespan directly and instantaneously. Second, a risk of dying from warfare weaponry carries with it a stark element of fright and fear as it usually happens in open space - making it more easily to be witnessed and recalled compared to other more subtle medical causes.====Therefore, landmine prevalence and its entailed accidents in Cambodia is a suitable setting for my empirical examination. Furthermore, the main victims of landmine casualties in the country are prime-age adults – accounting for 80 percent of total casualties (CMVIS 2012). Precisely, this is the type of mortality risk that does not affect the whole lifespan of an individual but more specifically at the ages where individuals are active in the labour market. Given this setting, the analysis can concentrate on the prime-age survival probability, which is known to be a key determinant of schooling decisions (Cervellati and Sunde 2013, De la Croix and Licandro 2013, Strulik and Vollmer 2013).====In detail, my main empirical approach uses a triple difference estimation (TD hereafter), which exploits three key variations of landmine-related mortality risk: spatial, temporal, and gender-related. The spatial difference in landmine prevalence and accidents across Cambodia is a consequence of the military strategies of the Khmer Rouge at the end of Cambodia's civil conflict in the 1980s, which left the western part of the country more heavily mined. The within-district temporal variation comes from the timing of international collaborations of landmine clearance operations around the years 2004 and 2005. The third source of variation comes from the male-biased nature of landmine casualties in Cambodia. According to the casualty statistics, adult males account for around 90 percent of total landmine casualties in the past 20 years (CMVIS 2012, Roberts 2011). Therefore, the change in the intensity of landmine mortality contributes directly to Cambodian males’ life expectancy whilst leaving that of the females predominantly unchanged. Such a gender disparity in mortality risk allows me to use the females as another key comparison group in the analysis and therefore account for potential unobservables that vary across time and location but are gender-neutral. In sum, my measure of landmine mortality risk is the district-level number of gender-specific landmine casualties per 1,000 prime-age adults in a given year.====My analysis uses individual-level data on school attainment from the Cambodian 1998 and 2008 censuses (IPUMS samples). In the first set of the analysis, I estimate the effect of mortality risk on primary school attainment by, in effect, comparing the outcomes of male versus female respondents living in the same district in the 1998 and 2008 censuses. I find that an additional casualty per 1,000 prime-age population (landmine casualty rate or ==== hereafter) is associated with a 4.2 percentage points (====) decrease in the probability of having attended or graduated from primary school. This estimate is robust to reasonable changes in specification and estimation methods. In the second analysis, I look at the effect of mortality risk on secondary school attainment of another set of individuals from the censuses. The estimated marginal effect is higher – at 6.1 pp. Nonetheless, the effect on secondary school attainment declines to 3.1 pp when I alternatively use gender-specific LMR in the estimation.====In a supplementary analysis, I investigate the potential role of heuristic probability in determining the extent to which mortality risks affect human capital investment decisions. Judging the frequency of an event is found to be influenced by individuals’ subjective ability to remember or recall such events and therefore leads to an exaggeration of the risk magnitude in a situation where substantial publicity of the event or emotions are at play (Kahneman and Tversky 1979, Slovic et al. 1982). In this context, optimal decisions may not respond to a change in mortality risk from a low-probability event (landmine accidents) in the same way as that of a high-probability one (road traffic accidents) – even when both events are otherwise comparable (non-health, prime-age and male-biased mortality). The estimation shows that schooling outcomes of children are responsive to the mortality risk resulting from landmines, but not from road traffic accidents.====This article is also related to a growing literature that looks into the legacy of civil conflicts and violence on human capital development.==== The existing evidence points that the effects of violence on educational achievements are mostly heterogeneous - depending particularly on types of violence and educational outcomes. Recent studies have estimated the negative effects of being exposed to ongoing violence on educational performances Looking at the effect of drug-induced violence in Mexico, Brown and Velasquez (2017) suggest that financial hardship is a key driver of the negative effect on education outcomes, while Brück et al. (2019) focus on the implication of civil conflict on the West Bank on high school students. Brück et al. (2019) find that violent events reduce the supply-side of education.==== In contrast to Brown and Velasquez (2017) and Brück et al. (2019), I can separately isolate the role of changes in mortality risk on human capital accumulation in a situation whereby other relevant factors in the case of ongoing conflicts, for instance, uncertainties, school infrastructure damages, or psychological costs, are of fewer concerns (Koppensteiner and Menezes 2021, Gerardino 2014).====A smaller but growing literature has investigated the effect of landmines on socio-economic well-being. Closely related to my work is Merrouche (2011), which looks at the impact of exposure to landmine contamination during the civil conflict on the subsequent educational attainment of the affected birth cohorts. By focusing on the post-war period, my TD estimation can arguably shut off other confounding channels.==== In addition, a quasi-experimental study on landmine-driven amputees by Takasaki (2020) shed light on the effect of disability, poverty and adverse intergenerational consequence. In particular, he shows a decline in children's schooling and an increase in child labour in households with landmine-induced disabled parents.====The article proceeds as follows: the next section discusses the context surrounding landmines in Cambodia.

A single child has certain common characteristics related to ,"The only child family is now the fastest growing family unit in many countries.==== The rise of only children has resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of only child peers, which brings a great change to the classroom environment. This change may manifest in multiple ways. Since parents are more likely to notice and praise only children’s achievements, they might be more ambitious and have higher self-esteem, which would lead to a more competitive social interaction (Li and Qiu, 2021). On the other hand, only children do not learn social skills by interacting with siblings, which might affect their participation in some collective activities.====The role of social interactions in changing individual behaviors is central to many areas of social science. A bulk of recent economic literature have tried to document the effect of social interactions on economic and social outcomes in different real-world settings (Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, 2014, Hvide, Östberg, 2015, Nicoletti, et al., 2018, Opper, 2019). One question of particular interest is how social interactions in the classroom environment affect children’s development since the classroom is a key context for human capital accumulation. There is a general consensus that only children and non-only children exhibit differences in behaviors, such as cognitive functions and personality traits. These dramatic changes in the composition of only child peers might have a great influence on social interactions in the classroom environment, which may further affect students’ cognitive and non-cognitive abilities.====However, there is limited evidence regarding the causal role of only child peers’ composition on students’ cognitive and non-cognitive abilities. And there are at least two important reasons for understanding them. First of all, many believe that peer effects play an important role in determining students’ academic performance. Both policymakers and researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to consequences of peer effects in the classroom. Empirical studies have focused on a wide range of peer characteristics such as gender, ability, and social background (Ammermueller, Pischke, 2009, Angrist, Lang, 2004, Arcidiacono, Nicholson, 2005, Booij, Leuven, Oosterbeek, 2017, Carrell, Fullerton, West, 2009, Gong, Lu, Song, 2021, Sacerdote, 2001, Xu, Zhang, Zhou, 2020, Zimmerman, 2003). As the only child is becoming the norm, little is known about how only child peers influence the child’s development in the classroom. We have added to this literature by providing, to our knowledge for the first time, empirical evidence on the influence of only child peers on students’ cognitive and non-cognitive performance. Second, understanding the effects of only child composition in the classroom and the mechanisms that drive these effects could shed light on educational policies that improve students’ school performance, such as the optimal grouping of students into class, effective allocation of resources within schools, and designing educational programs to develop social and non-cognitive skills for all students. Our research also contributes to uncovering the mechanisms by utilizing unique data on both the behavior and beliefs of teachers and students. We directly tested how a teacher’s teaching behavior differs by only child composition in the classroom, as well as how parents’ educational investment, students’ behavior, and belief are influenced by the class’s only child composition.====The central problem of estimating peer influence in a school setting is the non-random grouping of students. Students may self-select into schools and classes based on their family background, personality traits, and innate abilities. Recently, some have addressed this selection issue through randomization (e.g., Chetty, Friedman, Hilger, Saez, Schanzenbach, Yagan, 2011, Duflo, Kremer, Robinson, 2011, Gong, Lu, Song, 2021, Sacerdote, 2001, Shue, 2013, Todd, Wolpin, 2018, Zimmerman, 2003). Others have employed cross-cohort variation (e.g., Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2013, Carrell, Fullerton, West, 2009, Gould, Lavy, Daniele Paserman, 2009, Hoxby, 2000, Lavy, Schlosser, 2011). This study addresses the selection problem by utilizing a representative random assignment of students into the classroom in Chinese middle schools.====For this study, we employed a nationally representative middle school survey, 2013–2014 China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), to estimate how the composition of only child peers affects students’ cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. To detect the causal effect, we restricted our sample to schools of student random assignment, and conducted balancing tests for students’ predetermined characteristics to confirm this randomized assignment. And school-grade fixed effects were also controlled for removing any school level factors.====We found that the composition of only children in the classroom has a significant positive effect on students’ academic performance. A 10% point rise in the composition of only child peers increases students’ test scores by 6.78% of a standard deviation. However, for non-cognitive outcomes, we found that students feel more mental stress when facing more only child classmates in the classroom. The impact of the composition of only child students on social development is also negative and statistically significant. Subjective well-being in school life seems to not have been changed by this group characteristic.====We then explore potential mechanisms driving the impact of only child peers on students’ cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. We tested seven possible channels individually from four aspects of interactions in this education system: student-teacher interactions (praise and question, responsibility, discussion in lectures, teachers’ time allocation to lectures, grading and home visits), student-parent interactions, student-student interactions, and students’ learning efforts. We discovered that teachers will be more likely to be responsible if their class has a higher proportion of only children. This is possible because teachers have been influenced by the parents of only children, and paid more attention to their academic performance. However, teachers are more likely to tailor a less interactive teaching style in the lecture, and intra-student interactions are less friendly and satisfying. This phenomenon is associated with the composition of only child students, who are less cooperative and have social skills deficits (Cameron, Erkal, Gangadharan, Meng, 2013, Downey, Condron, Yucel, 2015, Merry, Bobbitt-Zeher, Downey, 2020); teaching practices and peer pressure are also strongly correlated with students’ beliefs about cooperation (Algan et al., 2013).====In the last part of our empirical analysis, to quantify the power of each mechanism explaining the effect of this group characteristic on students’ outcomes and their total explanatory power, we employed a mechanism decomposition method proposed by Heckman et al. (2013) and Gelbach (2016). The estimated decomposition of each mechanism documented that teachers’ praise and questions in a lecture, student-parent interactions, and student-student interactions explain a large share (32.524%) of the effect of the only child peer composition on academic performance. For social development, we found that the lack of student-student interactions explains approximately 22.503% of the loss of social development in school. For mental stress, teachers’ praise and questions, student-parent interactions and student-student interactions accounted for only 13.471%.====This paper is relevant to three dimensions of work in economics and education. The first dimension is the impact of an increasing number of children without siblings resulting from the low fertility intention and population control policy. A bulk of the literature focuses on this topic at the societal level, such as family structure changes, labor market shocks, and aging populations (Li, Zang, An, 2013, Maestas, Mullen, Powell, 2016, Razin, Sadka, Swagel, 2002, Zhang, 2017). From the view of resource allocation in economics, many researchers have also explored the quantity-quality tradeoff of children and resource dilution theory in the family setting (Becker, Lewis, 1973, Blake, 1981, Liu, 2014, Qin, Zhuang, Yang, 2017, Rosenzweig, Zhang, 2009, Stormshak, Bellanti, Bierman, 1996, Wang, Zhang, 2018, Wei, Wu, Lv, Zhou, Han, Liu, Luo, 2016). Recently, several researchers have gradually paid attention to the prosociality of only children during interactions with others; for example, social preferences. They found that only children are less trusting and less cooperative (Cameron, Erkal, Gangadharan, Meng, 2013, Li, Qiu, 2021) and fail to gain more social skills than their counterparts with siblings (Downey, Condron, 2004, Downey, Condron, Yucel, 2015, Whiteman, McHale, Soli, 2011). In the school setting, the prosociality of the only child cohort might alter the classroom environment, which might have a spillover effect on students’ outcomes. However, surprisingly, few papers have considered these potential problems. Our work will contribute to gaining insight into this point.====A second connection is thus in line with the empirical literature on the importance of social interactions on student outcomes. Manski (1993) divided social interactions into two parts: endogenous social interaction effects (group behaviors or ability) and exogenous social interaction effects (the contextual effect or group characteristics). Many works support the idea that endogenous social interaction effects play an important role in determining students’ performance (Duflo, Kremer, Robinson, 2011, Imberman, Kugler, Sacerdote, 2012, Kremer, Levy, 2008, Lefgren, 2004, Zimmerman, 2003). For example, group behaviors have a negative impact on students’ conduct, such as alcohol drinking, smoking and dropping out of high school (Gaviria, Raphael, 2001, Kremer, Levy, 2008, Li, Zang, An, 2013, Powell, Tauras, Ross, 2005). Booij et al. (2017) revealed that high-ability peers have positive effects on students’ test scores. Further, Dahl et al. (2020) found that social interactions within family networks determine students’ major choices in secondary school. Moreover, many studies indicate that endogenous social interaction effects have a “snowball effect” on individual behaviors or outcomes (e.g., positive group behavior affects positive students’ behavior, and positive students’ behavior reversely leads to more positive group behavior) (Blume, Brock, Durlauf, Jayaraman, 2015, Bramoullé, Djebbari, Fortin, 2009, Sacerdote, 2001). Even though group characteristics could not have a social multiplier effect through the feedback loop as group ability and behaviors, it involves a form of social learning as group risk aversion according to Young (2009), the classroom environment as the group gender effect in Gong et al. (2021), or prosociality formation as the group socioeconomic status effect in Kosse et al. (2020). Therefore, group characteristics could be important for understanding the formation of non-cognitive outcomes for students. This is vital for economics and education policymakers, as some scholars have found that the impact of social interactions on student academic outcomes will fade out in later grades, but non-cognitive outcomes will persist in the long run (Chetty et al., 2011). However, research has long ignored this group effect. We will extend the literature to a new dimension of group characteristics, the only child cohort, and examine the influence of this group feature on both students’ academic performance and non-cognitive outcomes.====This paper also provides evidence for the impact of social interactions on the classroom environment. Scholars paid limited attention to the mechanisms through which social interactions affect student development. Classmates, like family members, are the source of aspirations, information, motivation, and direct interactions in learning, and interactions with them will change students’ learning beliefs. Moreover, classmates may affect the classroom process; for example, classmates could aid learning through questions and answers in the lecture, and contribute to the pace of instruction (Lazear, 2001). Research in the field of cooperative learning has revealed that students could report increased efficacy and mastery goal orientation when their classes are organized more cooperatively (Adu, Galloway, 2015, Nichols, Miller, 1994, Zakaria, Chin, Daud, 2010). Social interactions among students also affect reading engagement (Guthrie et al., 1995). Moreover, successful peer relationships play an important role in the development of cognitive outcomes and school life adjustment (Berndt, Keefe, 1995, Ryan, Patrick, 2001). In our context, since parents have higher education expectations for only children than children with siblings, the classroom environment may be more competitive when it contains a larger composition of only children. Only children with limited social skills are also more likely to create a less information-sharing environment. Therefore, the behaviors of teachers, parents, and students who interact in the education system react to this change in the classroom environment, and will help us to further understand the deep mechanisms behind this story. In this paper, nationally representative questionnaires administered in China surveyed sufficient information covering student-teacher interactions, student-parent interactions, student-student interactions, and students’ learning efforts, which made the deep analysis possible. To decompose each mechanism, we used a novel method to estimate the relative weight of possible channels.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we introduces this nationally representative education panel survey (CEPS) that we employed, as well as the descriptive statistics. Section 3 reviews the key challenge of estimating the effects of only child peers, and then describes the estimation strategy in our study. Section 4 presents and discusses empirical results on both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes and robustness check results. Section 5 estimates the underlying mechanisms behind this story and the power of all possible channels. Section 6 discusses the heterogeneous influences of only child peers. Finally, Section 7 concludes our work and briefly reviews the implications of the findings.",The impact of only child peers on students’ cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712200121X,23 July 2022,2022,Research Article,76.0

We first estimate a micro empirical model of wage rigidity that takes into account minimum wage dynamics. We then use a simulation method to investigate the implications of lumpy micro wage adjustment for aggregate wages. Both national and sectoral minimum wages have a large effect on the timing and on the size of wage adjustments. Minimum wage setting institutions contribute to increasing the time it takes to fully absorb a shock to wages by one year, although the resulting wage changes are significantly higher. Minimum wages contribute to amplifying, by a factor of 1.7, the response of wages to past ","In standard macro models, wage stickiness is one of the key ingredients that generate fluctuations in employment or real effects of monetary policy (Erceg, Henderson, Levin, 2000, Smets, Wouters, 2003). Micro empirical evidence on wage rigidity is thus highly relevant for macro models and a recent literature has documented new stylized facts on wage stickiness (Taylor, 2016 for a survey). However, this literature often disregards minimum wage and collective wage bargaining as potential sources of wage rigidity when, in most European countries, they potentially affect the great majority of workers. This paper aims to fill this gap and provides new empirical evidence on how minimum wages – set at national level or collectively bargained at sectoral level – can shape aggregate wage dynamics.====The French labour market is a relevant case study because it has similar wage-setting institutional features to many other European countries: dominance of sectoral wage agreements, broad coverage of agreements because of extension procedures and the existence of a National Minimum Wage (NMW). Even if each European country is characterized by a specific combination of these features, we believe that more general lessons for the euro area can be drawn from the French results.====One key empirical challenge when measuring the impact of minimum wages on wage rigidity is to link - at the micro level and at an infra annual frequency - wage trajectories to the appropriate sector- and job-specific minimum wage. In this paper, we use a large dataset of individual wages collected at a quarterly frequency by the French Ministry of Labour over the period 2005 to 2015. We match this data set with quarterly hand-collected data on bargained sectoral wage floors for more than 350 industries (covering almost all workers in the private sector) and also with data on firm-level wage agreements.====Using this matched micro dataset on wages and minimum wages, we first estimate a microeconometric wage rigidity model in which the timing and the size of wage adjustments depend on inflation or unemployment but also on national or sectoral minimum wages. We then show that the aggregate wage response to a shock cannot easily be derived from parameter estimates of the micro wage rigidity model for two reasons. First, in this set-up, since wages are rigid at the micro level, a shock has long-lasting effects on aggregate wage dynamics and micro estimates do not provide any direct information about the speed of adjustment to a shock. Second, the transmission of a shock to wages is complicated by the existence of job-specific minimum wages. A shock can first affect negotiated minimum wages which then affect individual wages, leading to potential indirect effects of the initial shock on workers’ wages. One contribution of this paper is that using parameter estimates of our micro wage rigidity models, we simulate individual trajectories of wages and minimum wages, and we then aggregate these trajectories to describe how aggregate wages respond to a shock. Our simulation exercise allows us: (i) to assess aggregate wage persistence due to micro lumpiness in wage changes; and (ii) to investigate how minimum wages shape the transmission of a shock to aggregate wages.====We document three sets of new empirical findings. First, micro wage stickiness translates into a delayed aggregate wage response to a shock: a ==== increase in inflation takes a little under four years to be fully incorporated into wages. Taking state-dependent factors into account modifies the response of aggregate wage dynamics to a shock compared with a set-up where we assume exogenous frequency of wage adjustment. Second, we estimate the medium-run direct effects of the main drivers of aggregate wages. After five years, a ==== increase in inflation has a direct effect of 0.24 pp on aggregate wage increases, while unemployment has only a small negative effect. Another contribution of our paper is that we estimate the direct effects of minimum wages on aggregate wage dynamics. We find that after five years, a ==== increase in the NMW or sectoral wage floors has an impact of 0.13 pp and 0.16 pp respectively. Third, minimum wages amplify the effect of past inflation on aggregate wages. Once we allow the NMW and sectoral minimum wages to react to aggregate shocks, the overall effect of inflation on aggregate wages rises to 0.42 pp and the effect of the NMW to 0.17 pp.====Our paper is a contribution to the empirical literature documenting patterns of nominal wage rigidity. The first papers calibrating wage rigidity used firm-level wage agreement data for the United States and Canada (Cecchetti, 1987, Christofides, 1987, Christofides, Wilton, 1983, Taylor, 1983), or Sweden (Fregert and Jonung, 1998) and more recently for France (Avouyi-Dovi, Fougère, Gautier, 2013, Fougère, Gautier, Roux, 2018). On the other hand, a recent growing literature has documented new facts on wage rigidity using administrative sources of actual wage data (Barattieri, Basu, Gottschalk, 2014, Grigsby, Hurst, Yildirmaz, 2021) for the United States, (Le Bihan et al., 2012) for France, (Sigurdsson and Sigurdardottir, 2016) for Iceland or (Lunneman and Wintr, 2015) for Luxembourg. However, these papers do not include any information on minimum wages or collective wage agreements even though these minimum wages cover the vast majority of workers in European countries.==== Our contribution is to fill this gap and to do so, we build on two recent empirical papers using similar wage data for France: Fougère et al. (2018) focus on the dynamics of sectoral wage floors and their determinants, while Le Bihan et al. (2012) look at actual wage dynamics but without any information on negotiated wages. We combine both approaches by relating actual wages to sectoral wage floors, which allows us to document how negotiated wage adjustments shape the wage response to aggregate shocks.====The most recent wage rigidity literature usually investigates the main drivers of wage adjustments by estimating microeconometric models of wage rigidity.==== In this paper, we go one step further: we use simple simulation exercises to derive implications of micro wage rigidity for aggregate wage dynamics (in particular for the speed of aggregate wage adjustment). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to derive empirically the implied aggregate wage dynamics from estimates of micro wage rigidity models. Moreover, using these simulation exercises, we are able to quantify quite precisely how national or sectoral minimum wages contribute to aggregate wage dynamics.====We also contribute to the empirical literature on the pass-through of minimum wages on other wages. Several empirical studies find that the NMW not only affects wages close to the NMW but has also spillover effects to higher wages (see for instance Autor, Manning, Smith, 2016, Card, Krueger, 1995, Fortin, Lemieux, Lloyd, 2021, Grossman, 1983, Neumark, Schweitzer, Wascher, 2004). Sectoral wage floors set by industry-level agreements can be a relevant channel through which the NMW can affect higher wages. In France - as in many European countries – each industry defines wage floors for representative occupations, and wage floors cannot be set below the NMW. Thus, when the NMW adjusts, industries have to update thousands of industry-level wage floors to keep them above the NMW. In addition, the NMW increase is regarded as the fair level for sectoral wage negotiations or as the norm and may be transmitted to the sectoral wage floors across the board.==== Wage floors then affect individual wages and are a possible channel of NMW spillover to higher wages (Dittrich et al., 2014). Our contribution is to quantify the empirical relevance of these spillover effects. We show that lower paid employees are more reliant on institutions (like the legal rule of NMW indexation) to achieve wage indexation whereas better paid workers are more able to protect their wage settlements (through collective wage bargaining) from the direct impact of inflation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a simple sticky wage model in which wages depend on minimum wages and derive some implications for aggregate wage persistence. Section 3 presents our micro datasets and documents stylized facts relating wage and minimum wage nominal rigidities. In Section 4, we present the estimation results of our microeconometric model of wage rigidity. In Section 5, using a simulation-aggregation exercise, we document empirical results on how aggregate wages respond to shocks.

Previous studies have examined the effects of return-to-work policies on beneficiaries’ labor supply decisions from the introduction of return-to-work policies, changes in the DI payments, eligibility, and screening process. The findings from those studies are mixed.==== There is incipient work on explaining these mixed findings by considering adjustment costs in beneficiaries’ labor supply decisions (Zaresani, 2020). The increase in work incentives induced by a policy change must be large enough to offset the adjustment cost if the goal is to increase the labor supply of the DI beneficiaries. The evidence on the effects of clawback regimes that influence the size of the induced financial incentives, probably due to the lack of such policy variations, is scarce, and it could be another explanation for the mixed findings. Results in this area would be important for understanding labor supply policies’ ramifications and better design of DI policies.====We examine the effects of return-to-work policies’ clawback regimes on DI beneficiaries’ labor supply decisions. Specifically, we compare return-to-work policies in two Canadian provincial DI programs with similar screening, eligibility criteria, and benefits but different clawback regimes. One is Alberta’s “Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped” (hereafter AISH) program, with a generous clawback regime featuring an earnings exemption threshold,==== wherein monthly DI payments gradually get reduced as earnings increase. A reform in April 2012 further increased its generosity, allowing the beneficiaries to work more while collecting a larger portion of their DI payments. The second program is the “Ontario Disability Support Program” (hereafter ODSP), with a single rate clawback regime. We estimate the causal effects of AISH’s clawback regime change on beneficiaries’ earnings and labor force participation decisions in a Difference-in-Differences (DD) framework using ODSP as a control group.==== We also provide suggestive evidence on the relative magnitude of the substitution versus income effects of the reform. To gain further insight into the effects of the reform apart from average effects, we employ a quantile DD framework. Finally, we estimate the elasticity of earnings in the exempted range with respect to a generosity measure of the clawback regime.====We use individual-level longitudinal administrative data on monthly earnings of AISH and ODSP beneficiaries spanning one year and a half of pre- and two years of post-reform obtained from the Alberta and Ontario governments. Observing monthly earnings is essential since the earnings thresholds are monthly based. The data also has information on beneficiaries’ characteristics, including gender, age, family structure, type of disability, and location of residence.====Our analysis provides three main conclusions. First, a more generous clawback regime causes an increase in the mean labor supply along with both the intensive and the extensive margins. The DD model’s estimated effects, controlling for individual fixed effects, are an 11.91% increase in the average inflation-adjusted monthly earnings and a modest 0.78% point increase in the labor force participation rate.====Second, the estimates are heterogeneous by beneficiaries’ family structure, age, gender, type of disability, and location of residence. The estimates are larger for men, younger beneficiaries, those with dependents, those with psychotic disabilities, and beneficiaries who reside in metropolitan areas. Suggestive evidence shows that the income effects of the reform are negligible and that a more generous clawback regime affects work incentives. The quantile DD estimates show that the higher percentiles of the earnings are the drivers of the increase in mean earnings. Findings suggest that targeted policies may work better to encourage DI beneficiaries to return to work.====Third, an increase in the generosity of a clawback regime decreases the portion of the beneficiaries with earnings in the exempted range. The estimated elasticities suggest that a 10% increase in generosity decreases the portion of beneficiaries with earnings in the exempted range by 11.4% and 3.3% for the beneficiaries without and with dependents, respectively.====Our findings provide evidence on the labor supply responses to different clawback regimes of return-to-work policies in DI programs, an important policy domain. While return-to-work policies aim at getting DI beneficiaries into the labor force, empirical findings on the effectiveness of such policies are not conclusive. Hoynes and Moffitt (1999), Benitez-Silva et al. (2011), Weathers II and Hemmeter (2011) and Bütler et al. (2015) find no effects from financial incentives to work in the United States and Switzerland. Meanwhile Zaresani (2018), Campolieti and Riddell (2012), Kostol and Mogstad (2014) and Ruh and Staubli (2019) find positive responses respectively in Canada, Norway and Austria. Beyond a change in financial incentives, medical reassessment of DI recipients and trial work periods in the United States do not appear to affect the labor supply (Autor and Duggan, 2006). Moore (2015) finds positive effects on the labor supply of those who lost their benefits after the removal of drug and alcohol addictions as qualifying conditions for DI programs in the United States. Borghans et al. (2014) and Staubli Staubli (2011) examine the effects of terminating benefits and stricter eligibility criteria in DI programs in the Netherlands and Austria, respectively. They find that individuals substitute DI benefits by collecting more from other social assistance programs. Campolieti (2004); Fortin et al. (2004); Gelber et al. (2017); Lemieux and Milligan (2008) and Gruber (2000) find that providing more generous benefits has negative effects on labor supply in social assistance programs in Canada and the United States. We contribute to this literature by examining the impacts of financial incentives induced by the return-to-work policies’ clawback regime on labor supply decisions.",Return-to-work policies’ clawback regime and labor supply in disability insurance programs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001063,20 July 2022,2022,Research Article,78.0

We examine the gender-differentiated labor impacts of droughts using unique individual-level panel data for agricultural households in India over half a decade. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity across individuals, we find that women’s workdays are 19% lower than men’s when a drought occurs, driven by the former’s lack of diversification to the non-farm sector. Women are less likely to work outside their village and migrate relative to men in response to droughts and are consequently unable to cope fully with the adverse agricultural productivity shock. We find suggestive evidence in support of social costs emanating from gender norms that constrain women’s access to non-farm work opportunities. The results highlight the gendered impact of climate shocks, potentially exacerbating extant gender gaps in the labor market.","Climate change has not only resulted in a rise in average temperatures, but it has also increased the incidence and severity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods (Schiermeier, 2018). Such weather shocks are predicted to rise further if climate change continues unabated (Hsiang, Kopp, 2018, IPCC, 2021). Amongst all economic sectors, agriculture is likely to face the greatest brunt of increasing rainfall uncertainty since more than 75% of the world’s cropped area is rain-fed. Weather shocks resulting from extreme rainfall are, thus, likely to make agricultural incomes and employment prone to productivity risks - a greater concern in developing countries where agricultural systems are largely rain-fed and are also managed by some of the poorest communities. The absence of social insurance and incomplete credit markets in low-income economies underlies the importance of labor as a resource for individuals to cope with such shocks. Additionally, negative short-term productivity shocks such as droughts can potentially exacerbate extant gender differences in labor market outcomes when women’s access to off-farm work opportunities is constrained by social factors such as low mobility.====India, with 40% of its workforce employed in the agriculture sector, has experienced an increased incidence, duration and intensity of droughts, over the last century (Fig. 1).==== In this paper, we combine high frequency, individual-level panel data capturing monthly labor supply and seasonal migration during 2010–14 across eight agro-climatic zones of India to analyze the role of labor markets in mitigating the impact of adverse agricultural production shocks due to droughts. Specifically, we examine the short-term impact of deficient rainfall on individuals’ overall labor force participation, employment on the farm and diversification towards the non-farm sector on both the extensive and intensive margins in rural areas. In a context where men are often better placed to take advantage of available coping mechanisms through their access to other work via seasonal migration, we assess these labor responses by gender. Thus, we also uncover the mechanisms underlying the gender-differentiated impacts on employment.====Our results indicate a fall in women’s labor force participation relative to that of men’s in the event of a drought. We find that women are 7.1% less likely to be employed but 80% more likely to seek work than men in a drought year. On the intensive margin, women’s employment relative to that of men’s is lower by 19%. This is because men increase their days spent on non-farm work by 22.5%, but there is no significant impact on women’s engagement in the non-farm sector. Consequently, women’s non-farm workdays relative to men’s fall by 20.1% in drought years. At the same time, women spend 29.4% more days seeking work, relative to men, when faced with a drought shock. Hence, while men diversify to non-farm sector jobs to cope with droughts, women continue to stay in the farm sector, even as they seek work and their real farm wage earnings (conditional on being employed on the farm) and real daily wage rates fall by 38.1% and 11.4%, respectively.====We find that the lack of substitution towards the non-farm sector in response to a drought by women is due to their restricted mobility. Women are less likely than men to work outside the village or migrate, on average, and more so in drought years. The probability that men take up work outside the village and migrate during a drought increases by 1.7 percentage points (pp) and 0.8 pp, respectively, but there is no impact on women’s workplace location. Men’s higher mobility translates into 18.6% higher non-farm earnings for them relative to women, in the event of a drought.====We find suggestive evidence for social costs emanating from rigid gender norms that place a higher burden of home production and care work on women, as well as concerns around women’s sexual ‘purity’ that inhibit their access to alternative sources of employment beyond their immediate vicinity, as possible explanations behind their lower mobility. Not surprisingly, our analysis shows that women who are younger, married and with young children are not only less likely to divert their labor to the non-farm sector, but are also less likely to migrate relative to men with the same characteristics. These findings are robust to individuals’ unobserved heterogeneity, seasonality, secular and village specific trends. They are also held up by nationally representative district-level panel data.====It is well acknowledged that reliance on insurance is mostly absent, while credit markets are incomplete, in agricultural economies (Morduch, 1995). Hence, utilization of labor, specifically a diversification to the non-farm sector, has been documented as a coping strategy adopted by agricultural households during economic shocks that adversely affect crop yields and incomes (Blakeslee, Fishman, Srinivasan, 2020, Branco, Feres, 2021, Colmer, 2021, Grabrucker, Grimm, 2021, Minale, 2018, Rose, 2001).====Studies also document a fall in real daily farm wages due to a reduction in demand for labor during a drought, with a larger wage reduction in areas with lower access to non-farm opportunities (Auffhammer, Ramanathan, Vincent, 2012, Jayachandran, 2006, Mahajan, 2017, Mueller, Osgood, 2009). Naturally, households often migrate when incomes and livelihoods are adversely affected due to weather shocks like deficient rainfall (see Badiani, Safir, 2008, Marchiori, Maystadt, Schumacher, 2012, Morten, 2019, among many others), heat stress (Cai et al., 2016), floods (Giannelli and Canessa, 2022) and storms (Gröger and Zylberberg, 2016).====However, much less is known about the individual, specifically gender-differentiated responses to these shocks. In the context of developing countries where women are generally less mobile and less likely to search widely for work (Andrabi, Das, Khwaja, 2013, Heath, Mobarak, 2015), men may be better placed to cope with productivity shocks in agriculture and diversify into sectors less subject to weather shocks. But evidence of gender differences in labor response for smoothing the risk emanating from weather shocks, is almost absent, with a few exceptions. Huang et al. (2020) use retrospective employment data for three years from rural China to examine labor re-allocation, in response to temperature and precipitation change, from farm to non-farm activities by gender at the province level. They find no differential impact in take up of non-farm work by gender due to such shocks. In Uganda, where men and women cultivate separate plots of land, Agamile et al. (2021) show that women diversify to more risky, commercial crops and away from subsistence farming while men allocate more time to off-farm labor employment during a drought. However, none of these papers addresses either individual or household level unobserved heterogeneity in assessing the response to climate shocks or explore the underlying mechanisms.====While the existing literature largely focuses on how households diversify their income sources when farm productivity shrinks, we focus on the gender differences in individual decisions when struck by an adverse agricultural productivity shock. Second, and relatedly, unlike the aggregate geographical data used in most previous studies, we underline the potential gender-differentiated impact of climatic shocks such as droughts utilizing novel individual-level panel data over eight agro-climatic zones, collected at a monthly frequency. We are thus able to account for seasonal impacts that are relevant to the agricultural sector.====Furthermore, none of the existing studies provide mechanisms behind the observed gender-differentiated impacts. Our analysis uncovers the underlying mechanisms that can explain the lower likelihood of women substituting towards less risky, non-farm sector jobs, relative to men through detailed data on the nature of employment, place of work, and migration. Unlike most household surveys that capture employment details of only current members of the household and miss out on those members who are temporary migrants, our data allow us to investigate coping mechanisms from farm income losses through engagement in seasonal migration, and the extent to which men and women are able to access non-farm sources of employment through this channel. Our research, thus, also speaks to the literature on migration, by highlighting the role of seasonal migration as a coping mechanism and its potential in exacerbating the impact of weather shocks on gender equality (Cattaneo et al., 2019).====Lastly, through our heterogeneity analyses of the individual-level data which exploits the age, marital status, and parenthood of an individual, we are able to show that social norms around the gendered nature of household production and women’s purity place a cost on women’s access to employment opportunities outside their village.====Indeed, we find suggestive evidence that public employment programs that provide work close to women’s homes, not only mitigate production risks in agriculture in the short-run but also stem gender disparities in employment opportunities. Social norms, thus, can plausibly explain the observed gender-differentiated impacts of droughts in our context. This mechanism, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously highlighted in the literature. While we do not find evidence in support of gender skill differentials or safety concerns, we are unable to test for gender-differentiated changes in demand for labor in the farm and non-farm sectors, due to data constraints.====The above findings are in contrast to the theoretical prediction and empirical evidence which shows that women’s employment rate increases in response to negative household level idiosyncratic income shocks in low-income economies (Attanasio, Low, Sánchez-Marcos, 2005, Sabarwal, Sinha, Buvinic, 2011, Skoufias, Parker, 2006). Our findings show that while women are more likely to seek work due to negative aggregate income shocks, their employment may not increase if their labor mobility is limited. Additionally, climatic shocks may have long-term effects. Our cross-sectional estimates indicate that gender gaps in non-farm employment and migration are larger in villages facing higher risks from rainfall variability, suggesting that men may permanently shift their occupational structure to the less risky non-farm sector. Indeed, Albert et al. (2021) finds that regions facing increased frequency of droughts witness a shift in employment towards the non-farm sector and an increase in population outflows over two decades in Brazil. In contrast, Liu et al. (2021) and Jessoe et al. (2018) show that long-term temperature increases reduce non-farm employment share and lower rural-urban migration rates in India and Mexico, respectively. Our findings, thus, call for further research on the longer-term effects of weather shocks, from a gender perspective.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we set up the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the data used in the analysis and discusses the estimation strategy. The results and their robustness are presented in Section 4.

Following this notion, we analyse the impact of the German minimum wage introduction in 2015 on the gender wage gap. Germany poses an interesting case study in this context, since it has a rather high gender wage gap and set the minimum wage at a relatively high level, affecting more than four million employees. Based on individual data from the Structure of Earnings Survey, containing information for over one million employees working in 60,000 firms, we use a difference-in-difference framework that exploits regional differences in the bite of the minimum wage. We find a significant negative effect of the minimum wage on the regional gender wage gap. Between 2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th percentile of the wage distribution was reduced by 4.6 percentage points (or 32%) in regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage compared to less affected regions. For the gap at the 25th percentile, the effect still amounted to ====18%, while for the mean it was smaller (====11%) and not particularly robust. We thus find that the minimum wage can indeed reduce gender wage disparities. While the effect is highest for the low-paid, it also reaches up into higher parts of the wage distribution.","The differences between men’s and women’s earnings have been studied extensively over recent years. One of its dimensions is the fact that women are often overrepresented among the low-paid employees (Card, Cardoso, Kline, 2016, Kahn, 2015). This leads to the existence of a wage gap at the bottom of the distribution, also called ‘sticky floors’, and one possible way to alleviate this issue is the introduction of a minimum wage. If female employees are more prevalent among the wage floor beneficiaries than their male counterparts, they should also be disproportionately affected by a minimum wage, which would reduce wage disparities and thus the gender wage gap. In their seminal paper, DiNardo et al. (1996) find that labour market institutions such as a minimum wage can indeed reduce inequality, especially so for women. This line of research has been continued by an ample number of studies establishing a negative relationship between the minimum wage and the gender wage gap for a variety of countries.====In this context, Germany poses an interesting case study. On the one hand, it is a country with a relatively high gender wage gap, especially at the bottom of the wage distribution. In 2014, the difference between the earnings of full-time employed men and full-time employed women amounted to 17.2 percent in Germany, placing it in the upper third of countries with the highest gaps, above the OECD average (see Fig. 1a).==== At the first decile of the wage distribution, Germany even shows a wage difference of 18.2% in 2014, placing it among the eight countries with the highest gaps among low-income earners, and well above the United States and the United Kingdom (see Fig. 1b). It is thus evident that Germany suffers from high gender wage discrepancies in an OECD comparison, especially among low-wage earners.==== On the other hand, Germany introduced a nationwide minimum wage in 2015, which was set at a comparably high level and had only few exemptions.==== With € 8.50 gross per hour, it ranked among the highest wage floors in Europe in terms of purchasing power (Caliendo et al., 2019). Its level is to be re-evaluated every two years, and it was increased to € 8.84 in January 2017, being followed by additional increases in 2019 and the subsequent years (Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission, Mindestlohnkommission). Caused by its high initial value, the reform affected about four million employees, i.e. about ten percent of the eligible workers (Destatis, 2016). Among them, women were vastly overrepresented, since they accounted for two-thirds of affected employees (Burauel, Caliendo, Fedorets, Grabka, Schröder, Schupp, Wittbrodt, 2017, Mindestlohnkommission). This has been attributed to insufficient regulations of the low-pay sector and gender segregation, which lead to an unequal coverage of collective bargaining agreements for men and women (Grimshaw, Rubery, 2013, Herzog-Stein, Lübker, Pusch, Schulten, Watt, 2018). Accordingly, the introduction of the wage floor could have an influence on gender inequality. In a simulation study, Boll et al. (2015) predict that in the absence of job losses, the minimum wage could reduce the average gender wage gap in Germany by 2.5 percentage points; and with job losses, the effect could even be larger. This points to a potential caveat, namely that low-paid women quitting or losing their jobs could cause a decrease in the gap. However, since all ex-post evaluation studies find only small employment effects and no strong evidence of gender-specific job-losses (see, e.g., Bonin, Isphording, Krause, Lichter, Pestel, Rinne, Caliendo, Obst, Preuss, Schröder, Grabka, Caliendo, Schröder, Wittbrodt, 2019, Pestel, Bonin, Isphording, Gregory, Caliendo), this does not seem to be an issue in Germany.====In our analysis, we mainly employ data from 2014 and 2018, which we obtain from the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES), a large obligatory survey that comprises detailed wage information for over one million employees working in 60,000 firms. First, we descriptively look at the wages of male and female employees who are eligible for the minimum wage and compare the wage gap in 2014 with the one in 2018. Second, following Card (1992), we make use of regional variation in the “minimum wage bite”, i.e. the degree to which a region is affected by the minimum wage, and analyse the causal effects of the minimum wage introduction on regional gender wage gaps.==== We are able to identify a significant effect on the wage gap at the regional level, especially for low-paid employees. Between 2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th percentile was reduced by 4.6 percentage points (or 32%) in regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage compared to less affected regions. For the gap at the 25th percentile, the effect still amounted to ====18%, while for the mean it was smaller (====11%) and not particularly robust. Using a continuous bite measure, we can show that an increase in a region’s bite by ten percentage points, reduces the wage at the 10th percentile by 3.3 percentage points. This thus shows that the minimum wage reform led to a significant decrease in the wage gap especially at the bottom of the wage distribution.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the previous literature on gender-specific minimum wage effects on wages and presents the data that we use. Additionally, it offers a first descriptive overview of the gender-specific wages before and after the reform, as well as the regional differences in the wage gap and the bite measure. Section 3.2 then presents the identification strategy and displays the results of the main estimation and the robustness analyses.

The identification strategy is based on quasi-random variations in the exposure to HP peers across cohorts, within the same university and the same degree programme. The impact of the gender of HP students, proxied by their high school final grade, is asymmetric. We found that the beneficial effects of HP peers are stronger on same-gender students and, in particular, for females. Moreover, while female HP students also positively influence male students, HP males do not generally exert any impact on their female peers. The exposure to male HP students becomes negative for low-ability students.","An overwhelming number of studies have tried to estimate the extent to which peer ability can influence students individual achievement. Most papers have observed the positive effects of high-ability peers, but some works have highlighted the potentially negative effect of competition and pressure on certain types of students (Feld, Zölitz, 2017, Fischer, 2017). In fact, from a theoretical point of view, the exposure to high-performing peers could be performance-enhancing, through knowledge spillovers or motivation, or it may have the reverse effect of reducing incentives to make an effort, due to the negative impact on self-perception. The effects of exposure to high-ability peers may vary according to the gender of the students and to the gender of the peer. In fact, a rich and growing line of research has provided evidence that women and men are likely to differ with respect to psychological attitudes, self-esteem, risk preferences, and attitudes toward competition and collaboration (Azmat, Petrongolo, 2014, Croson, Gneezy, 2009, Eyal, Epley, 2017, Marianne, 2011). This may have important implications for peer interactions and for the ways in which the high-ability peers can influence students’ behaviour and performance.====Given these psychological and behavioural differences across genders, a very recent strand of the peer effects literature has started to study the interplay between peer ability and gender (Cools, Fernández, Patacchini, Feld, Zölitz, 2022, Mouganie, Wang, 2020, Pagani, Pica, 2021). At the moment, there is only a handful of studies that combine the effects of ability and gender and, furthermore, it is hard to obtain a unified pattern for the findings, since the evidence originates from different educational levels and from more or less selected samples of students’ populations.====In line with this literature, this paper estimates the impacts of high-performing (HP) peers on individual performance in tertiary education, differentiating by the gender of the student and by the gender of the HP peers. Two reasons make the study of peer effects at the university level particularly interesting. First, the research into the higher education setting is very limited despite the peculiarity of the interactions between males and females at this level of education, as compared to lower levels (Sacerdote, 2011). During the tertiary education students are already young adults that have self-selected fully into their educational trajectories, according to their preferences, specific skills, gender norms, past schooling experience and relative achievements. Thus, finding that peer effects are determinant even at this stage would strengthen the case for the importance of peer effects and the social context in a broader sense. Second, previous papers on higher education had access to data from a single university or field of study but it is plausible that peer dynamics strongly differ depending on the context (for example, the field of study, the gender composition, the attractiveness of the university.). Differently, this paper exploits rich administrative data covering the universe of Italian university students for several years.====In this work we ask the following questions: does exposure to more HP females or males positively affect a student’s performance? Are female or male HP peers more effective in influencing the other students? Do these effects differ according to whether the student has the same or a different gender from his/her HP peers? We address these questions using student-level administrative data that cover the population of the Italian university students from 2006 to 2014 (Anagrafe Nazionale Studenti). The data follow students from enrolment to graduation/dropout and provide a lot of information on the academic career of the student and of his/her peers and on their educational background. We estimate the effects of the HP peers that are enrolled, in the first year, in the same degree programme and university on several individual outcomes. We focus on the effects on first-year academic academic performance (number of credits achieved, the average grade obtained in the exams and the probability of dropping out), as well as on the students’ final academic outcome (probability of graduating and final grades).====There are two methodological problems that are important to take into account in the identification strategy: the selection and the reflection problems. To solve the selection problem, we identify the causal effect by exploiting variations in the exposure of students to HP peers across cohorts within university and degree programme. The basic idea is to compare the outcomes of students from adjacent cohorts that are enrolled in the same university/degree, exposed to different fractions of HP female and male students (with respect to the total number of peers) due to purely random factors. This strategy, introduced by Hoxby (2000), is based on the assumption that a student may make decisions based on the overall characteristics of the degree programme/university, but that s/he does not decide to enroll on the basis of the specific characteristics of their cohort (in terms of ability and gender) within the same degree programme and university. Thus, the variation due to differences across cohorts within the same degree program and university can be treated as quasi-random.====The second methodological problem is reflection. As defined in (Manski, 1993), it is impossible to distinguish the effect of peers on the individual from the effect of the individual on peers because they are simultaneously determined. To solve this problem, we define the HP students according to the final grade they obtained in high school, before the enrollment in a university program.====Consistently with earlier studies, we find that, after controlling for student’s ability and other characteristics, the fraction of HP students is relevant for students achievement. In addition we find a clear asymmetry in the peer effect depending on student and peers genders. In particular, we found that same-gender HP peers have the strongest positive effects. This can be rationalized within the framework of the role models that, applied in the education context, emphasized psychological mechanisms that act on students’ efforts and motivation in order to explain individual outcomes==== Being surrounded by students who are ’similar’ in terms of gender and observing them doing particularly well may positively affect their perception of themselves, their study efforts, attitudes towards class and socializing behaviour, since they may feel more confident of being in the appropriate setting. The stronger positive effect found when the HP peerstudent gender is matched may be also the result of enhanced peer interaction between peers of the same sex, because similarity allows students to help each other more easily and spend time together.====The second important result of this analysis refers to the different effect of HP males and females on the opposite-gender students. In fact, on the one hand, we find that HP females have beneficial effects on males too (even if smaller in magnitude). This can be explained by the fact that women appear to be more collaborative than men (Guarin, Babin, 2021, Molina, Gimenez-Nadal, Cuesta, Garcia-Lazaro, Moreno, Sanchez, 2013), regardless of the gender of the other person. On the other hand, HP males do not exert any effect on their female peers and when they do so - for example when considering the probability of getting higher grades - this effect can even become negative. This is consistent with the psychological theories and with the results of the literature according to which women tend to be discouraged by competition with men (Bordalo, Coffman, Gennaioli, Shleifer, 2019, Niederle, Segal, Vesterlund, 2013).====We complete our analysis by showing that the positive impact of the exposure to female HP peers is not only stronger in the short run: in fact, female HP peers also affect students’ long-term educational attainment (in terms of the probability of completing college education and the final grade obtained), with positive effects on human capital accumulation and on the efficiency of the universities. As regards the magnitude of the estimated effects, overall we show that HP peer mildly affect students academic outcomes, but the impact varies substantially according to the considered academic outcome.====Finally, we observe some heterogeneous effects according to student’s and degree’ characteristics. First, adverse effects from HP male peers are found when we consider low ability students but, in this case, this result is independent of gender. Second, all the peer effects are weaker if the class is heterogeneous in terms of ability. Third, some positive effects coming from HP males emerge when we consider high-ability female students, such as those enrolled in STEM fields.====As mentioned, the novelty of our paper refers to the fact that we are among the firsts to look simultaneously at the effects of gender and ability and there is certainly room for research for better understanding the relationship between these two factors. Our main references are Pagani and Pica (2021), who focus on primary schools, Busso et al. (2021), who analyse interactions in middle schools, while Mouganie and Wang (2020) and Cools et al. (2021) assess peer effects in high schools. As regards the higher education setting, the only existing works, to the best of our knowledge, are Ficano (2012) and Feld and Zölitz (2022). The first, considering a small selective private college, shows that male peer academic quality positively influences only male student performance, while female peer academic quality has no statistically significant effect on either male or female grades. The second work studies peer effects on the other students’ course choices and subject choices. In particular, considering the students in a Dutch business school, they find no significant effects of peer achievement on students probability of choosing a mathematical elective course or major. Our paper makes a contribution to the existing literature, providing the first causal evidence of asymmetries in gender peer effects in the higher education setting on several dimensions of the academic performance. Moreover, differently from the mentioned papers, our work has the advantage of relying on administrative data on the universe of Italian university students that allow us to provide clean and robust estimates and to explore novel and interesting margins of heterogeneity in the results. By exploiting the longitudinal dimension of our data, we are also able to study the impact of HP peers on medium-term outcomes of the students, considering the probability of graduating and the final grade obtained.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and discusses the identification issues. The results are set out in Section 4, where we also investigate the existence of heterogeneous effects and where we perform some robustness checks.

In the European Union men’s hourly wages are 16% higher than women’s (Eurostat, 2018). The German wage gap lies with more than 20% well above the EU average (Eurostat, 2018). When analyzing the GPG, researchers typically use regression models that are based on Mincer-type wage equations controlling for individual, job or firm characteristics. Yet, there is an ongoing debate about the pivotal control variables for estimation of the GPG (see Blau and Kahn, 2017). For identification of the ‘true’ GPG, the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) or unconfoundedness assumption has to hold. It is therefore necessary to control for both important wage predictors and variables with pronounced gender differences (see e.g. Angrist and Pischke, 2010; Fortin et al., 2011).====In this paper, we estimate the adjusted GPG, i.e. the pay penalty of being female, conditional on a set of covariates selected with a machine learning approach. We thus use a data-driven approach for model selection. We compare estimation results from conventional model specifications with model specifications based on variable selection performed by a machine learning algorithm. In case of the conventional models, we estimate the adjusted gap using sets of covariates proposed by the literature. The analysis is conducted at the mean (using OLS) as well as at selected percentiles (using linear unconditional quantile regression based on the Recentered Influence Function (RIF)-OLS). For machine learning based model selection, we rely on the post-double Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) proposed by Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen, 2014, Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen, 2014. Using this type of model selection ensures a model specification that controls for relevant wage predictors as well as for important differences between men and women. The latter is essential for obtaining valid estimates of the adjusted GPG given the data at hand.====As we use unconditional quantile regression for estimations beyond the mean, we run a separate LASSO for the RIF at each quantile considered. Additionally, we take two different LASSO specifications into account. First, we use a restricted LASSO specification that excludes parameters of traditional covariates such as education or labor market experience from shrinkage and forces those variables to be part of the model. Second, we consider an unrestricted LASSO specification, where the algorithm freely chooses the explanatory variables among a huge set of potential controls (more than 5,000 in our case). For estimation, we use the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) providing a large nationally representative sample with detailed information on individual human capital, labor market and family background characteristics as well as on character skills.====We include a broad range of explanatory variables such as education, labor market experience or cognitive and non-cognitive skills affecting productivity and thus wages. Further, we add various demographic and family background characteristics such as non-labor income, having children or young children that may affect gender differences in labor market selection (e.g. participation or full-time work). Based on this broad set of controls, conditional independence of gender-specific outcomes can be achieved, as we include variables that determine (or at least proxy) gender differences in productivity and labor market selection (Briel et al., 2022). In order to test the latter, we use the method of Oster (2019) that allows us to compare robustness to remaining selection on unobservables across the various model specifications. Based on this method, we calculate the ratio of remaining selection on unobservables relative to selection on observables that is necessary for the GPG to vanish. The latter enables us to compare the extent of potential violations of the CIA between conventional and data-driven model specifications. Moreover, we use standard decomposition techniques (Blinder, 1973, Oaxaca, 1973) to analyze the impact of the selected sets of controls on the raw gap as well as on its components (explained and unexplained).====Blau and Kahn (2017) provide an overview of what has been learned about gender differences in pay. In many studies, the observed (raw) GPGs are separated into an explained and unexplained part using Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions or further developments of this method. While the explained part stems from differences in the control variables, the unexplained part is related to gender differences in coefficients. Thus, the unexplained part reflects differences in pay of individuals with identical observable characteristics and therefore some authors claim it to reflect discrimination (Goldin, 2014).==== Despite different model specifications, most empirical studies end up with a substantial residual part of the GPG.====Key characteristics used as control variables for estimation of GPGs are observable labor market and human capital variables such as job market tenure, labor market experience, educational attainment as well as industrial and occupational controls (Blau, Kahn, 2017, Goldin, 2006, Mandel, Semyonov, 2014). Further, individual characteristics such as personal background (Bailey, Hershbein, Miller, 2012, Fortin, 2008) and union status as well as firm-specific characteristics like firm size, presence of a works council or collective wage bargaining may be important (e.g. Bruns, 2019, Fitzenberger, Kohn, Lembcke, 2013, Heinze, Wolf, 2010, Oberfichtner, Schnabel, Töpfer, 2020). With the aim of decreasing omitted variables bias and fulfilling the CIA, a more recent part of the literature considers alternative driving forces behind gender differences in pay. Since non-cognitive or character skills are found to be key determinants of social and economic success (Almlund et al., 2011) and are characterized by large gender-specific differences (Bertrand, 2011, Blau, Kahn, 2017, Gensowski, Gørtz, Schurer, 2021, Weisberg, DeYoung, Hirsh, 2011), they are promising candidates for explaining the GPG.====Another point highlighted by the literature is that wage effects may not be homogeneous across different subgroups of the population. Gensowski (2018) showed that the effects of character skills differ between educational groups and Wilde et al. (2010) showed that the wage gap associated with children is higher for high-skilled women. Overall, there is a multitude of potential drivers of gender differences in pay that may not be equally relevant at different points of the wage distribution. Bach et al. (2018) and Meara et al. (2020) focus on the role of heterogeneity in estimation of the US GPG using double-LASSO and matching approaches, respectively. Both papers find that there is substantial heterogeneity in the gap with respect to occupations and different subgroups of the population such as high-skilled workers. Most closely related to our study is the work of Bach et al. (2018). Compared to our paper, they introduce heterogeneity not in terms of relations between different control variables but directly through multiple interactions with the female dummy. This approach estimates for each individual a specific GPG depending on the observed values of the control variables interacted with the female dummy. The main interest of their work lies in the distribution of the GPGs, while we are interested in model selection and performance of the post-double-LASSO estimator compared to conventional models.====The literature generally selects the relevant variables based on economic reasoning. However, we know little about the functional form, i.e. which interactions or polynomials are relevant. For example, employer learning==== and thus interactions of character skill measures and tenure may be relevant (Heineck, Anger, 2010, Nyhus, Pons, 2012). Moreover, the effect of some character skills on wages may be nonlinear. An excess of conscientiousness may imply productivity-inhibiting perfectionism, while an excess of agreeableness may result in a lack of autonomy hindering productivity and thus lowering wages. Yet, considering all potential interactions and higher-order polynomials results in a fully flexible model that we cannot estimate. In order to make selection of variables not arbitrary but systematic, we propose to use supervised machine learning. In addition, the data-driven approach allows us to learn more about the functional form of the selected variables (Belloni et al., 2014a). Further, not all control variables may be equally relevant for different subsamples or at different quantiles. For instance, having children may particularly punish high-skilled women in terms of wages (Wilde et al., 2010). As we run quantile-specific LASSOs, we allow the machine learning algorithm to select different control variables at different points of the wage distribution.====We find substantial differences in the adjusted GPGs between the conventional and data-driven models. While the conventional model specifications suggest particularly high GPGs at the top of the distribution (glass ceiling), the machine learning results find an U-shaped GPG along the distribution with particularly high gaps at the top (glass ceiling) and bottom (sticky floor) of the distribution. The latter corresponds to the result of the raw gap. In fact, depending on the model specification, the gap varies substantially at the bottom and top, while it is relatively stable at the mean and median of the wage distribution. Relatively stable estimates at the mean and median may be attributable to the fact that standard (augmented) Mincer-type wage models have been developed for estimation at the mean. We use the post-double LASSO procedure in order to obtain a valid estimate of the GPG. Although model selection is not the main focus of this method, we highlight the most relevant findings of the selected model specifications in order to learn more about the functional form with which the variables should enter the model (Belloni et al., 2014b).====The results suggest that different sets of covariates should be used at different points of the wage distribution. For instance, controls related to labor market experience are dominant at the top of the distribution. Further, the selected data-driven models are more flexible than conventional models for estimation of GPGs, i.e. they contain numerous interactions and higher-order polynomials.====Interaction terms of the number of children in a household with e.g. being married or working part-time are selected at all points of the distribution. This finding implies that having children represents an important source of gender differences in pay at all points of the distribution. More so, the result suggests that the wage effect attributable to children depends on family background and job characteristics.====Additionally, the LASSO selects character skill measures throughout the distribution. This result holds in particular for interactions of character skill variables with job characteristics like having a permanent contract or education controls.====As number of children or character skills are generally not included in conventional wage models, they represent a potential source of omitted variable bias.====We find that all estimates of the adjusted GPG are robust to remaining selection on unobservables. However, the results suggest that the CIA is more likely to hold in case of the data-driven model specifications compared to the conventional models. Decomposition results show that the data-driven models explain almost the entire gap at the top of the wage distribution, while conventional model specifications do not. The latter may be attributable either to the additional covariates included in the data-driven models or to the fact that the data-driven models are more flexible and quantile-specific.====The paper is organized as follows.

Can emergency childcare policies during a pandemic mitigate increases in parental stress and negative parenting behavior? To answer these questions, this study leverages cross-state variation in emergency childcare eligibility rules during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany and draws on unique data from the 2019 and 2020 waves of the German AID:A family panel. Employing a triple-differences approach we identify short- to medium-term intention-to-treat effects and find that while emergency care policies did not considerably affect parents’ life satisfaction, partnership satisfaction or mental health, they have been effective in diminishing harsh parenting behavior. We find partly gendered effects, specifically on paternal parenting behavior. Our results suggest that decreasing parental well-being likely constitutes a general effect of the pandemic, whereas the observed increase in negative and potentially harmful parenting behavior is largely directly caused by school and daycare facility closures.","Confronted with nationwide closures of schools and daycare facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, many parents in Germany suddenly had to overhaul their work-care-arrangements. Only a very limited number of parents who between them had a specific constellation of systemically relevant occupations were granted access to emergency childcare (henceforth referred to as EC). In this paper, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in eligibility rules across German federal states to evaluate the effect of emergency childcare policies on parental well-being and parenting behavior during the pandemic. Closed schools and childcare facilities, work from home arrangements, social distancing policies, and financial and health-related worries during the first lockdown created a stressful environment for families. These circumstances are likely to increase parenting stress, which in turn, might negatively influence parenting behavior (====; ====). Previous research indicates a positive association between negative parenting behavior and higher levels of children externalizing and internalizing problems, even if negative parenting behavior occurs infrequently (====). Moreover, harsh parenting has also been shown to be a risk factor for child abuse and neglect (====).====We employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD, or: triple differences) design to identify intention-to-treat (ITT) effects. We leverage cross-state variation in EC eligibility rules during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany, and can hence compare outcome changes of systemically relevant parents ==== EC access to outcome changes of equally systemically relevant parents in other states ==== EC access. This controls for the fact that systemically relevant parents (nurses, doctors and other key workers) are specifically affected in pandemic times, irrespective of EC. This cross-state comparison is based on the assumption that, were it not for EC policies, outcome changes for systemically relevant parents would have been similar across federal states. However, federal states were differently affected by the pandemic and hence reacted differently. To control for state-specific shocks that may have affected parents, we hence additionally use outcome changes for parents with no systemically relevant occupation between them, resulting in a triple-difference design. The ITT parameter resulting from the triple-difference design, i.e. the causal effect of emergency childcare ====.====We draw on unique data from two waves of a German family panel “Growing up in Germany: Everyday Worlds” (AID:A) that surveyed families in 2019 and 4 to 5 months after the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Based on a sample of 646 parents, we find that EC was not able to permanently shelter families from a considerable reduction in parental well-being. However, the provision of EC was effective in diminishing increases in harsh parenting in terms of ‘becoming angry’ among the EC-eligible parents. This effect of EC is evident several months post-lockdown, more pronounced in families with children of preschool-age or younger, and completely cancels out increases in harsh parenting among compliers. Furthermore, for fathers only, we find that EC prevented decreases in positive parenting behavior (child-centered communication), and increases in harsh parenting in terms of ‘punishing harder than merited’. Evaluating short- to medium-term effects, we likely measure lower bounds of immediate effects during the lockdown and identify the persistent component of the overall impact.====Our results disentangle effects caused directly by school and daycare closures from general effects of the pandemic since by studying families that use childcare, we are able to compare families that experienced a complete disruption of external childcare provision with those that, thanks to their access to EC, did not. This comparison is most meaningful for children in daycare where EC was quantitatively and qualitatively more equivalent to the pre-pandemic situation than EC for school-children. We find that, while decreasing parental well-being appears to be a general pandemic effect rather than a specific effect of the closures, the observed increase in negative and potentially harmful parenting behavior is largely directly caused by school and daycare closures.====These findings contribute to the growing body of empirical literature on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects families and family well-being====; ====; ====). We contribute to this strand of literature by evaluating the effects of a temporary disruption in external childcare provision.

The deterrent impact of having a son on the future likelihood of receiving convictions persists for as long as ten years post-childbirth. Utilizing population-wide monthly ==== registers and Census data, we provide key insights into the role model hypothesis. We show that young fathers with a son have (i) a higher likelihood of being in employment, (ii) higher wages & salaries, (iii) lower benefit dependency, (iv) better qualification, and (v) a higher likelihood of being in a partnered relationship.","Family formation events such as forming romantic relationships and childbirths are considered to be positive milestones in a man’s life. Both mothers and fathers tend to significantly adjust their behavior right from the prenatal stage (Massenkoff and Rose, 2022). However, differences in fathers’ parental investments, such as childcare, marital stability, fertility, and family income, are often driven by their gender preferences for children (Dahl, Moretti, 2008, Mammen, 2008, Morgan, Lye, Condran, 1988). García et al. (2018) show that families that raise girls tend to have poorer home environments and are more socio-economically disadvantaged than families with boys. Lundberg et al. (2007) observed that fathers are more likely to stay in the household if the child is a boy; conversely, Baker and Milligan (2016) document that parental preferences (for investing) are not influenced by the child’s gender. It is also worth noting that parental preference for a child’s gender can be influenced by socio-demographic attributes, including cultural norms, religious beliefs, and societal structures (Andersson, Hank, Rønsen, Vikat, 2006, Barcellos, Carvalho, Lleras-Muney, 2014).====In a recent study by Dustmann and Landers (2021), the authors provide evidence for a link between criminal behavior and preference for a child’s gender: young fathers aged 15–20 commit significantly fewer crimes when having a boy compared to those having a girl. As a potential explanation, the authors note that ‘young fathers decide to act more responsibly and as a role model when they father a boy’ (Dustmann and Landers, 2021, p. 3263). While Dustmann and Landers (2021)’s results indicate that having a son prompts young fathers to distance themselves from criminal activities, our study seeks to build on and extend their empirical evidence by investigating whether those fathers reallocate their time to more productive activities to support their family.====Our study is the first to consolidate the dispersed literature in the related space and present a holistic portrayal of the child-gender effect on young fathers’ criminal activity, labor market performance, and family formation. We use New Zealand’s high-quality administrative data to investigate the impact of a child’s gender on young fathers’ likelihood of receiving a future conviction by following our sample for up to ten years after childbirth. Using high-frequency population-wide tax registers, we examine whether a child’s gender has a statistically significant impact on their father’s labor market performance. We further look at Census data and Department of Internal Affairs’ birth records to test the robustness of our key labor market findings and to explore additional behavioral mechanisms such as educational achievements, partnership status, and further childbearing. To that end, our study provides key insights into the role model hypothesis concerning young fathers, especially those who tend to have contact with the criminal justice system before childbirth. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of studying long-term implications of child gender by showing that these effects accumulate strongly over the course of ten years.====A large body of literature shows that young fathers are prone to various socio-economic risks, like dropping out of school, having poorer employment prospects, and engaging in risky behavior, including criminal activities (Larson, Hussey, Gillmore, Gilchrist, 1996, Weinman, Smith, Buzi, 2002, Weinmann, Agurcia, Rickert, Berenson, Volk, 2006). Having a criminal record at a young age, in the form of an arrest or a conviction, can have a scarring impact on future labor market prospects. The stigma of having a criminal past can negatively affect employment opportunities and can undermine the acquisition of human and social capital (Western et al., 2001). Following rational choice theory, individuals who face adverse labor market opportunities that restrict access to legitimate ways of earning wage are more likely to turn to crime (Becker, 1968), thereby creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to exit. However, Sampson and Laub (1990), Corman et al. (2011), and more recently Massenkoff and Rose (2022) show that significant life events such as fatherhood can be considered as a ‘turning point’ which eventually leads to lower criminal activities.====To empirically assess the impact of the child’s gender on criminal behavior and labor market performance, we use New Zealand’s large administrative database, the Integrated Data Infrastructure. We begin our analysis by using highly detailed administrative data on all court charges registered in New Zealand, which we subsequently link with the Inland Revenue tax data and the 2013 Census. We track each individual over three years before the child’s birth and up to ten years thereafter.====Figure 1 provides a descriptive impression of criminal behavior of young fathers who have their first child between the age of 17 and 21. The left graph shows the fraction of individuals who received at least one conviction for each age year, separated by the child’s gender. The distribution peaks at the age of 19, where about 15% of the sample received a conviction and the same steadily drops to about 6% at age 29. Crucial for our study, and even without considering the timing of childbirth, we observe a small gap in the share of convictions between men fathering a son than those who have a daughter. For example, at age 23, the respective fraction is 11.5% for fathers with a daughter and 9.8% for fathers with a son. This narrows with age–suggesting that childbirth can largely motivate young fathers to refrain from criminal activities and reallocate their resources into investments that can support childcare.====Several studies have shown that there is substantial state dependence in criminal activities (Blumstein, Farrington, Moitra, 1985, Nagin, Paternoster, 1991, Nagin, Paternoster, 2000). Mancino et al. (2016) present evidence suggesting that keeping youth out of crime can have long-lasting effects. To that end, Dustmann and Landers (2021) create a crime propensity measure for the pre-birth period and find that the effect of ‘having a son versus a daughter on fathers’ criminal convictions is far more pronounced for those fathers whose crime propensity is high’ [p. 3287]. In a similar spirit, we differentiate young fathers according to their pre-birth conviction records and construct a binary variable if the father was convicted between 36 and 6 months before the child’s birth and 0 otherwise. The graph in Fig. 1b indicates that the child’s gender plays a large role for this sub-population. Following on from the previous example, we see that for fathers aged 23, the share of convicted is 4 percentage lower for those having sons compared to those with daughters (30.9% vs 26.2%). Furthermore, the impact of the child’s gender seems to be long-lasting, as this gap is still apparent even until the age 27.====Our regression estimates confirm our descriptive findings. The estimated interaction effect of a child’s gender and their father’s pre-birth convictions is strongly significant, suggesting that young pre-birth offenders respond considerably to their child’s gender. This includes having a lower accumulated number of convictions as well as a lower number of serious convictions characterized by imprisonment or home detention when having a boy compared to having a girl child. For young fathers without a pre-birth conviction, we hardly find any significant impact of the child’s gender on differences in future criminal activities.====We extend our analysis to investigating differences in labor market performance by linking Inland Revenue tax data to our sample of young fathers. For previously convicted fathers with a son, we find that over the ten years post-childbirth, there is significantly stronger labor market attachment (indicated by a 15%-increase in number of months receiving earnings from wages and salaries), higher accumulated earnings from monthly wages and salaries (suggested by a 21.5%-rise), and a lower level of benefit dependency (indicated by a 21.6%-decline). We find no statistically significant differences in paternal response to their child’s gender when looking at young fathers with no pre-birth convictions. When linking our spine with the 2013 Census, our key labor market findings based on Inland Revenue data are further supported by the corresponding survey measures. Further, we find a lower probability of having no qualification and an elevated likelihood of being in a partnered relationship (married, civil union, or ====) when having a son compared to having a daughter. Once again, these results hold only for fathers with a pre-birth conviction.====Our results are consistent with the role model hypothesis: young fathers want to become role models to their newborns, which is more pronounced if the child is a son rather than a daughter. We argue that the extended analysis of criminal activity, labor market performance, and family formation largely supports the role-model hypothesis. Sub-sample analyses show that the documented ====-effect among individuals with a criminal record is particularly pronounced among individuals with low labor market attachment before birth. These young fathers adjust towards productive activities and away from crime, in particular, violent offenses. This raises an interesting policy parameter; while small, there appears to be disparity in parental investments across child gender, potentially resulting in inequality in children’s long-term human capital outcomes.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe our primary data source, the sample, and discuss potential biases of the sample. In Section 3, we present descriptive evidence on the sample of fathers in New Zealand and provide a balancing test concerning the child’s gender. We then discuss our empirical strategy to identify the effects of the first child’s gender on convictions and labor market outcomes in Section 4.

The amount of the subsidy varies across regions, in the age and gender of the employees whose contracts are converted, and within these three dimensions over time. Using administrative individual-level panel data, I show that subsidies to permanent employment have a positive impact on the probability of entering parenthood for male employees but not for female employees. In contrast, subsidies increase the likelihood of having a second child for both male and female workers. I also find that the effect of subsidies on fertility is lower in magnitude for individuals who have a high opportunity cost of having a child, such as young, highly educated and non-cohabiting individuals. Based on a different aggregate dataset at the municipality level, I replicate the findings from the main analysis and quantify the incidence of subsidies to permanent employment for the Spanish population, which raised fertility by 1.43% at a cost of 18,964 euros per child born.","Temporary employment is widely used by employers in many countries as it is characterized by a limited duration and lower severance payment than permanent employment. For workers, however, temporary employment creates more job insecurity and fewer career prospects than permanent employment, which may have important implications on fertility. On the one hand, previous studies have shown that a higher job security raises fertility for women (Prifti and Vuri, 2013) and family size for cohabiting and married individuals (Clark and Lepinteur, 2020). On the other, career advancement increases the value of working relative to other activities (Becker, 1965), which may lead to reductions in fertility through increases in the opportunity cost of having a child (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019, Hotz, Miller, 1988, Schaller, 2016, Schultz, 1985). The effect of permanent contracts relative to temporary ones on fertility is therefore ambiguous, yet it is crucial for policy-makers to understand whether implementing policies that lead to a higher prevalence of permanent employment may also bring changes in fertility. As most advanced economies have experienced fertility rates under the replacement level of a population and suffered from ageing populations in the last decades, this type of policies may help increasing future economic growth.====This paper provides causal evidence on whether subsidies that incentivize the use of permanent employment are also effective ways of raising fertility. It does so by exploiting exogenous variation in subsidies to open-ended labour contracts in Spain as a quasi-natural experiment. These subsidies were given by the various regional governments to employers who converted temporary employees into permanent ones. The introduction, size, and eligibility conditions for subsidies were decided by the regional authorities, and frequently changed on a yearly basis. Consequently, the amount of the subsidy varied markedly across regions, in the age and gender of the employees whose contracts were converted, and within these three dimensions over time. The goal of the policy was only to incentivize employers to use permanent employment, thus the variation in subsidy generosity is unlikely to be correlated with unobserved determinants of individuals’ fertility. Previous research has studied the impact of these subsidies on permanent employment transitions (García Pérez and Rebollo Sanz, 2009) or used them to examine the effect of permanent employment on wealth accumulation and housing choices (Barceló, Villanueva, 2016, Barceló, Villanueva, 2018). Instead, the focus of this paper is to study whether subsidies to permanent employment change fertility, as well as gender differences and explanations behind this effect.====The analysis uses an individual-level administrative dataset that contains retrospective labour market and sociodemographic information on employees randomly selected from the Spanish Social Security records. Using this information, I construct a large panel dataset of 2.5 million observations that contains yearly information on the labour and fertility history of employees during the period of 1997–2004.====I show that subsidies to open-ended contracts were important drivers of fertility by increasing permanent employment for males and females. First, the subsidies policy led to an increase in the probability of male employees entering parenthood by 0.095 percentage points (this corresponds to 4.34% of their average likelihood of entering parenthood), but had no effect on female workers having the first child.==== Second, I show that subsidies to permanent employment increased the probability of having a second child for both male and female employees by 0.031 and 0.039 percentage points, which corresponds to an increase of 2.27% and 3.11% in their average probability of having a second child, respectively. Finally, I find that the effect on fertility was lower in magnitude when employees had a high opportunity cost of having children, such as when they were young, highly educated and did not cohabit with a partner. The empirical analysis is complemented with event-study figures providing supporting evidence on the validity of the parallel trend assumption and evidence suggesting that the average amount of the subsidies for which employers were eligible is not correlated with pre-determined characteristics. The paper also provides evidence showing that the main results are robust to: i) the choice of the sample used for the analysis; ii) the set of included control variables and iii) identification and estimation approach. The results are also broadly consistent when using different definitions of the subsidy policy and different choices of the dependent variable.====The paper also presents a separate analysis based on a different panel administrative dataset that contains yearly information on the birth and marriage rates in each of the 8108 municipalities in Spain. This aggregate dataset comes from the Spanish National Statistical Institute. In the aggregate analysis, I quantify the incidence of the subsidies policy on fertility and marriage rates for the entire Spanish population, and provide a second set of causal evidence that supports the main analysis. I show that subsidies to permanent employment increased fertility rates, which is in line with the results of the individual analysis. Using the aggregate estimates, I calculate that subsidies increased the total number of births in Spain by 5761 per year over the period of 1997–2004. Given that the yearly average number of births in Spain was 404,000 during the period of analysis and the total cost of the subsidies has been estimated at 874 million euros (García Pérez and Rebollo Sanz, 2007), the policy increased the birth rate in Spain by 1.43% each year it was in place, at the cost of 18,964 euros per child born. I also show that subsidies to permanent employment may have increased marriage rates, which is in line with previous evidence on economic stress increasing partnership separations (Bridges and Disney, 2016).====This paper primarily contributes to two strands of literature. First, the paper is relevant to the literature that studies the link between permanent employment prevalence and fertility.==== A higher permanent employment rate not only increases job security but also career prospects and wages in the labour market (Arulampalam, Booth, 1998, Bentolila, Dolado, Franz, Pissarides, 1994, Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002, Di Cintio, Grassi, 2015, García-Serrano, Malo, 2013, Jimeno, Toharia, 1993). On the one hand, prior studies have provided causal evidence suggesting that decreases in job insecurity raise fertility. For example, using a difference-in-differences approach and a sample of women, Prifti and Vuri (2013) find that a 1990 reform that strengthened Employment Protection Legislation in Italy through increases in dismissal costs raised fertility, and Clark and Lepinteur (2020) use a difference-in-differences model to show that a 1999 reform that increased dismissal costs of older individuals in France led to an increase in job insecurity for the younger population, which reduced fertility for cohabiting and married individuals. Moreover, Lopes (2020) uses a regression discontinuity type of model and a sample of women to find that a 2003 reform in Portugal that increased the duration of periods of job uncertainty led to decreases in their fertility. On the other hand, higher career outcomes generate two offsetting effects: (i) an income effect that raises fertility (Becker, 1960, Becker, 1965, Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, Taylor, 2013, Borg, 1989) and (ii) a substitution effect that augments the value of working relative to other activities, thus decreasing fertility (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019, Becker, 1965, Hotz, Miller, 1988, Schaller, 2016, Schultz, 1985). As a response, the effect that a higher prevalence of permanent employment in the labour market may have on fertility is ambiguous. Prior literature has reported that a higher temporary employment rate leads to reductions in the probability of women having the first child (De La Rica, Iza, 2005, Modena, Rondinelli, Sabatini, 2014) and to overall decreases in fertility for the population (Adserà, 2004) due to the implicit higher instability of fixed-term contracts. Moreover, Gutiérrez-Domènech (2008) has reported that these reductions in fertility may operate through women postponing getting married when holding temporary contracts. While the existing literature has therefore so far reported a negative impact of temporary contracts on fertility, causal evidence on this effect is still missing, and so it is unclear whether policies aiming to promote permanent employment are effective ways to raise fertility. I contribute to the previous literature by estimating and quantifying the causal effect of subsidies to permanent employment on fertility, by examining gender differences in this effect and by exploring plausible explanations as to why the previous impact differs for males and females.==== I use exogenous variation in subsidies to open-ended contracts in four dimensions as a quasi-natural experiment and a rich administrative panel dataset to estimate the previous effects.====Second, this paper contributes to a large number of studies on the importance of job security in the labour market for life decisions. Among them, Barceló and Villanueva (2016) use the aforementioned subsidies to show that when employees are older, they increase their financial wealth if they have a temporary job. More recently, Barceló and Villanueva (2018) have used the subsidies policy to show that higher job security raises the likelihood of employees owning and renting a house.==== Related to this, previous literature has found that greater income uncertainty reduces the probability of adults buying a house and increases renting (Diaz-Serrano, 2005, Gathergood, 2011). Furthermore, Becker et al. (2010) show that a decrease in job security among youth raises co-residence with parents and that a decline in the job security of parents has the opposite effect. Besides housing decisions, previous evidence has shown that greater job protection increases long-run investments among workers (Charness et al., 2017) and has important implications for welfare (Belot et al., 2007). I contribute to this literature by showing that increases in job security through policy-making also have an important causal effect on fertility as well as plausible explanations as to why this is the case.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the subsidies implemented to promote the use of permanent contracts.

We conducted an RCT to study the effects of remote peer mentoring at a German university that switched to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mentors and mentees met one-on-one online and discussed topics like self-organization and study techniques. We find positive impacts on motivation, studying behavior, and exam registrations. The intervention did not shift earned credits on average, but there is evidence for positive effects on the most able students.","Online delivery of tertiary education has taken center stage. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced virtually all education institutions to switch to online teaching. However, the literature has generally found online teaching to be inferior to classroom-based teaching (e.g., ====, ====). Switching to online teaching may thus aggravate the problem that many students struggle to complete their studies successfully (====). Accordingly, students expect and experience negative consequences of the COVID-19-induced shift to online teaching (====, ====, ====, ====, ====). One way to improve outcomes of online education could therefore be to assist students through online peer mentoring. Evidence on the effectiveness of such programs is scarce for online teaching, where they may be particularly helpful.====In this paper, we report results of a randomized trial studying the effects of peer mentoring at a German university that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, switched to online teaching for the spring term 2020. Our sample comprises 691 second term students from the core undergraduate program at the university’s ====. To assess the effectiveness of the program, we combine registry data with survey data on study behavior and motivation that we collected before the start of the examination period in the spring term 2020. Our paper presents the first evidence on the role of remote peer mentoring in online higher education.====The mentoring program focused on students’ general study skills, such as self-organization and study techniques. Mentors and mentees met one-on-one online. The program consisted of five meetings of around 40 minutes each that took place around every two weeks. In each meeting, mentors would discuss specific topics, such as mentees’ weekly study schedules, using materials provided by us, as well as follow-on discussions on topics from prior meetings. Importantly, we instructed mentors not to discuss any coursework with mentees. As mentors, we hired students from a more advanced term in the same study program. Thus, this kind of mentoring could be scaled up easily and at modest cost. Including one additional mentee into the program for a three-month period would cost about € 60.====Our setting is common for public universities across the developed world. Each fall, students enroll in the three-year bachelor’s program ====. In each of the first two terms, students are to pass six courses each worth five credits. Since the second term includes more rigorous courses relative to the first term, many students struggle in this term.==== A key advantage of our setting is that the spring term 2020 was conducted ====Our main results are as follows. First, the mentoring program improved students’ motivation and study behavior. Treated students report higher overall motivation, are more likely to report having studied throughout the spring term 2020, and are more likely to state they provided enough effort to reach their goals in this term. In contrast, students’ views on departmental services or on online teaching in the spring term 2020 or in general seem unaffected. Second, while these effects translate into more exam registrations, the average effect on earned credits is small and insignificant. Similarly, the students’ GPA is unaffected. Third, these results mask a heterogeneity that contrasts with common expectations on potential impacts of peer mentoring. For instance, we observe a positive effect on students who previously performed well, with no effects on other students. In addition, male students benefit more from the program, if anything. These results somewhat contrast expectations based on prior research suggesting that weaker students struggle most in online learning (e.g., ====, ====) and that female students tend to benefit more from mentoring (e.g., ====, ====).====We contribute to research on the effectiveness of online education. This literature has found online teaching to be less effective than classroom-based teaching (====, ====), likely due to problems of disorganization among students in online teaching (e.g. ====).==== Research on specific aspects of the online education production function is scarce. Closest to our work, ==== show that assigning online and regular students to an online planning module to construct weekly study schedules and reminders or loose mentoring via text messages does not affect students’ outcomes. We focus on a more comprehensive and intensive mentoring program with regular contact and guidance, which has been shown to matter (e.g., ====). We thus contribute by providing the first evidence on the role of peer mentoring programs for online higher education.====We also contribute to the experimental literature on mentoring interventions in higher education.==== Closest to our work, ==== experimentally study different coaching methods. They find that close one-on-one peer mentoring programs are effective in raising student outcomes. ==== show evidence from several nudging interventions that did not shift students’ academic outcomes, but improved their motivation. ==== test the impact of academic support and financial incentives on students’ GPA, finding performance increases among female students. However, they find no effects for academic support without financial incentives. Our program is targeted more towards individual mentor-mentee interactions, is more structured, and it takes place in an online environment where mentoring may be more important. We thus contribute by providing the first evidence on the effectiveness of close (peer) mentoring in online education and by extending the small experimental literature on mentoring effects in higher education.====, ====, ====). The closest paper is ====). Despite the nearly universal shift towards online teaching in higher education due to the pandemic, evidence on improving the effectiveness of online teaching in this context remains scarce. This is in spite of emerging evidence showing that the shift led to worse learning outcomes and depressed student expectations and outlooks (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).====We acknowledge that the situation during the pandemic was special relative to regular online education settings.

We construct several measures of relative within-household earnings potential to assess the importance of household specialization based on comparative advantage. The Netherlands offers a particularly interesting setting for studying household specialization since employees basically face no restrictions if they want to reduce their working hours. We find that women with a higher earnings capacity than their partner face lower earnings losses after childbirth and reduce their labor supply less than women with a low relative earnings potential. Yet, men’s labor market trajectories are largely unaffected by parenthood irrespective of their relative earnings potential in the household. There is thus no evidence that households divide market work and child care based on comparative advantage or ====. We provide some evidence that women with high earnings potential rely more on formal child care.","A recent literature shows that first-time parenthood has substantial and persistent negative effects on women’s labor market outcomes, while it has almost no effects for men (Bütikofer, Jensen, Salvanes, 2018, Chung, Barbara, Sandler, Sienkiewicz, 2017, Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2019, Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2019, Sieppi, Pehkonen, 2019). Inspired by Becker (1985) it has been hypothesized that household specialization based on comparative advantage is an important channel for this so-called child penalty for women. The evidence regarding this channel is, however, mixed. Angelov et al. (2016); Pora and Wilner (2019) and Chung et al. (2017) find support for it, while Andresen and Nix (2020); Kleven et al. (2021) and Rosenbaum (2019) do not. A possible reason for this are differences in relevant institutions regarding for example the possibilities to adjust working hours or to use formal child care for very young children.====We contribute to the literature by investigating the importance of household specialization in a setting – the Netherlands – where there are arguably no institutional hurdles to divide household tasks in a gender-neutral way. In the Netherlands, employees are legally entitled to unilaterally change the working hours of their already existing contract. This is one of the reasons why not only the share of part-time working women is very high, but also the fraction of men working less than 30 hours per week is with 19.4% in 2019 by far the highest among all OECD countries (OECD, 2020). It is therefore easier and presumably more accepted for fathers to trade market work for child care if their partner has better earnings prospects. Furthermore, formal child care is available for children as young as three months so that parents have the option to use it when paid maternity leave ends (Plantenga and Remery, 2009). This is different from the situation in, for example, Denmark, Norway or Sweden where children have to be nine or twelve months old to attend formal child care.====Our second contribution to the literature is that we analyze labor market trajectories of both partners in relation to various measures of their relative earnings potential. This is more comprehensive than approaches which restrict attention to the within-couple earnings gap (Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016, Chung, Barbara, Sandler, Sienkiewicz, 2017) or to women’s pre-childbirth rank in the wage distribution (Pora and Wilner, 2019), and will therefore provide a broader picture of the role of household specialization in explaining the child penalty.====Using the event-study approach proposed by Kleven et al. (2019b), we first replicate results from other countries; there are large and persistent negative effects of first-time parenthood on women’s earnings, while there is no effect on men’s earnings. The earnings child penalty is about 47% ten years after women have their first child. This is mostly due to a reduction in working hours right after childbirth and to a lesser degree to lower participation and a gradual decrease in wage rates. Conducting the analysis by parents’ level of education, we find a similar earnings child penalty for college and non-college educated women. We also find substantial, but heterogeneous child penalties for all fields of study, whereby the child penalty is lowest in the male-dominated fields of Informatics, and Science and Mathematics.====To study whether couples divide household and market work based on comparative advantage and bargaining power, we construct three (main) measures of mothers’ and fathers’ earnings potential. The first measure is based on the levels of education of both parents, the second on their fields of study, and the third on their predicted lifetime earnings. These measures differ in how sophisticated households are assumed to be when forming beliefs about their earnings potential. Using these different measures will give more insights into the factors that couples do or do not take into account when deciding about child care and market work. While our measures for relative earnings potential cover different aspects of earnings capacity, overall we find little evidence of household specialization based on comparative advantage. Women with higher within-household earnings capacity reduce their labor supply less than women with lower relative earnings potential, but men only marginally adjust their labor supply after childbirth irrespective of their relative earnings potential. We therefore conclude that even in a setting that is conducive for young parents to divide household tasks in a gender-neutral way, spouses do not specialize according to their comparative advantage. Descriptive evidence instead suggests that the use of formal child care is more sensitive to women’s earnings potential implying that households with higher-earning/higher-educated women use more child care to reconcile work and family.====Apart from the recent literature on the child penalty, our paper relates to the literature on the effects of first-time parenthood on women’s labor supply and earnings more generally (see e.g. Adda, Dustmann, Stevens, 2017, Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010, Hotz, Johansson, Karimi, 2017, Lundberg, Rose, 2000, Lundborg, Plug, Rasmussen, 2017, Paull, 2008, Waldfogel, 1998, Wilde, Batchelder, Ellwood, 2010). Our paper also relates to the vast literature on gender inequality in the labor market with recent reviews by Blau and Kahn (2017) and Olivetti and Petrongolo (2016). This literature finds that traditional human capital variables contribute little to the gender gap in recent years, but that gender differences in occupation and industry, career interruptions, shorter working hours and the unequal gender division of labor continue to play important roles.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

Employing city-by-year variation in the reform, we demonstrate that the ","Governments around the world use tax incentives to stimulate capital investment, and the effectiveness of such policies is well documented.==== However, fewer studies have examined the labor market effects of corporate taxes, and most of them are based on aggregate data at the firm or regional level (see e.g., Arulampalam, Devereux, Maffini, 2012, Cai, Harrison, 2018, Garrett, Ohrn, Suárez Serrato, 2020, Liu, Altshuler, 2013, Ohrn, 2019, Suárez Serrato, Zidar, 2016, Tuzel, Zhang, 2020, and Pham, 2020). A firm’s investment or its level of capital stock is inherently connected to the firm’s demand for labor; hence, such tax devices should affect labor market outcomes as well. To the extent that skilled labor is more complementary to capital than unskilled labor is (Griliches, 1969),==== the reduced user cost of capital would increase the demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor.====In this paper, we study how corporate tax cuts affect the employment and wages of individual workers by exploring China’s value-added tax (VAT) reform in 2007. The reform provides a good natural experiment for this purpose. First, the reform came as a surprise, and the pilot program was rolled out across cities in different years, imparting an exogenous shock to local firms.==== Indeed, the investment in treated versus control cities exhibits very similar time trends prior to the reform. Second, the reform substantially reduced the user cost of capital. In the pilot program, eligible firms could deduct their capital expenditure from the tax base for the calculation of VAT payable, equivalent to a drop in capital investment cost by 14.5%.==== As expected, the reform substantially raised capital accumulation for eligible firms as shown by prior work (Zhang, Chen, He, 2018, Liu, Mao, 2019, and Chen et al., 2019). We find a similar investment boom at the regional level. Exploiting the city-by-year variation in the 2007 pilot reform, our difference-in-differences (DD) estimations show that the reform raised investment in the treated cities (with a reduction in VAT for investment) relative to the control cities by 10% in the first two years post reform.====Conceptually, with capital-skill complementarity (Griliches, 1969), the reduction of VAT for investment can affect the demand for skilled and unskilled labor differently. The reduced cost of capital will have a scale effect, so the demand for all labor inputs increases. However, the substitution effects for different labor inputs can vary. If capital and skilled labor are complements in production, the substitution effect will accentuate the scale effect and further increase the demand for skilled labor. Meanwhile, firms may replace unskilled workers with machines if capital and unskilled labor are substitutable. Therefore, the substitution effect will oppose the scale effect, and the overall impact on the demand for unskilled labor is ==== ambiguous. Even if unskilled labor is complementary to capital, the demand for unskilled labor will increase less than that for skilled labor if skilled labor is more complementary to capital than is unskilled labor.====Employing data from the Urban Household Survey (UHS) of China, we examine how the reduction in the tax rate on capital investment affects employment and wages of skilled versus unskilled workers. Our DD estimates reveal limited impacts of the reform on overall employment, labor force participation, and unemployment. However, we find that the reform led to a 15% increase in the earnings of skilled workers (with college education or above), but those of unskilled workers were hardly affected. To assess the robustness of these findings, we show that these effects are not driven by pre-existing trends or contemporaneous changes in the relative supply of skills, trade exposure, or internet penetration. Leveraging further variation in treatment from baseline employment shares of affected industries in the local labor market, we find comparable but more precisely estimated policy effects on employment and wages. Overall, these results support the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis.====In addition to showing how corporate tax cuts affect individual employment and wages and testing for heterogeneous effects implied by capital-skill complementarity, our paper also speaks to the extensive literature on the sources of the skill earnings gap. Thoroughly-explored channels include trade, labor supply shocks, and skill-biased technological changes (see Autor, 2014 for a review). We complement this body of research by identifying a previously unexplored mechanism: changes in corporate taxation. While some have examined how the change in income taxation or corporate taxation affects income distribution across countries (Rubolino and Waldenström, 2020) or states (Nallareddy et al., 2018), none has explored the effects of taxation on income inequality through labor market changes. We are the first to use individual-level data to show that the reduction in tax on capital use by firms can increase the skill wage gap owing to capital-skill complementarity.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the institutional background and the data. In Section 3, we discuss the empirical strategies, report the main results, and conduct some robustness checks.

The need for more evidence on such implications remains critical in the context of developing countries where social protection programs, which come in the form of contributory social insurance and noncontributory social assistance schemes, have become increasingly popular (Chetty and Looney, 2006; Jung and Tran, 2012).==== The labor market implications of government mandated social insurance programs that often cover workers in the formal sector hinge primarily on who ultimately bears the cost of social security as it may elicit different responses from employers and employees. Measurement of these responses is crucial in determining whether social insurance reforms entail distortions and inefficiencies in the labor market, and the degree of participation of the labor force in the promised benefits. It is thus unsurprising that concerns remain about the unintended consequences of social protection programs that could potentially stymie the primary objective of consumption smoothing for broader sections of a country's labor force (Levy, 2008). Theoretical models for examining the labor market consequences of social insurance focus on the subjective valuation of the expected benefits in the eyes of employees. If workers have confidence in the promised benefits and consider employers’ contributions as deferred cash income, they may accept equivalent wage cuts that would stave off an increase in unit labor cost (Summers,1989; Gruber, 1997). This would prevent distortions in the labor market and leave employment levels largely unaffected by social insurance. Other conditions that allow full switching of the cost of social insurance to workers’ wages include inelastic labor supply or infinitely elastic labor demand (Gruber, 1997).====Estimating the effects of social insurance programs on wages and employment is, however, fraught with challenges as the payroll taxes that fund such schemes are often proportional contributions with nation-wide mandates. A widely used identification strategy relies on cross-firm variation in the degree of compliance with a social security reform based on the observed employer contribution rates, i.e., total employer contribution relative to the firm's wage bill, which often differs from the statutory contribution rate (Gruber, 1997; Kugler and Kugler, 2009; Bennmarker et al., 2009). An important challenge in using variation in the empirical contribution rate is measurement error in firm-level wage rate given that wage enters both sides of the econometric model. Equally important in this approach is the difficulty to isolate adjustments in the firm's compensation structure in response to social insurance reform from adjustments in the skill composition of the firm's workforce as a given firm-level mean wage rate could be consistent with different personnel policies on compensation, hiring and retention. Relying on firm-level data also implies ignoring potential heterogeneity in the effects of social insurance reform across workers based on personal and labor market characteristics. Other researchers attempt to identify the labor market effects of such reforms by using aggregate data at the level of cities or larger administrative units to take advantage of statutory differences in payroll taxes across locations within a given country or variation in enforcement intensity (Alemida and Carneiro, 2012; Curces et al., 2010). Obviously, such aggregate studies cannot shed any light on differences in firm-level responses to social insurance within a given locality, and they certainly cannot capture impact heterogeneity across individual workers.====This paper contributes to this literature by using matched employer-employee data to investigate the labor market implications of a social security reform program introduced by the Ethiopian government in mid-2011. The reform mandates pension and disability benefits for private sector employees — benefits that were previously offered exclusively to government employees. While this scheme constitutes a major expansion of social security in Ethiopia, it only covers permanent employees in the formal private sector. We focus particularly on adjustments in wages in response to the reform among formal private manufacturing firms. The paper is among a few studies including Anderson and Meyer (2000), Gruber and Kugler (1991), and Kugler (2005) that use worker-level data to examine the extent to which employers switch the cost of social insurance to workers’ wages. Existing worker-level studies on the wage effects of payroll taxes typically do not control for workers’ human capital with the exception of Kugler (2005). The latter study, however, relies only on worker-level data and does not control for firm heterogeneity in pay structure which could potentially bias the estimated reform effects. Taking advantage of the matched employer-employee data that we collected in 2016 for this project, we estimate adjustments in wage rates following the social insurance reform while controlling for firm specific factors as well as variation in human capital and personal characteristics of their employees. Different from previous studies, our identification strategy relies on a key provision under the 2011 reform that allows two different systems of social insurance to co-exist. One of them pertains to a group of firms which had voluntarily established so-called “Provident Funds” before the 2011 reform as a form of social security for their employees. The other one is the new scheme introduced by the 2011 reform and managed by the Private Organizations’ Employees Social Security Agency (POESSA) of Ethiopia. While details of the institutional settings will be provided shortly, firms with pre-existing provident funds serve as the control group given that a contributory scheme was already in place before the reform. Firms without provident funds are the treatment group as they are forced to make such contributions for the first time under the new pension law. Thus, we use a difference-in-differences estimator to estimate the wage effects of the reform using data on both groups of firms before and after the reform.====Our analysis shows that employers most impacted by the social insurance reform due to the absence of contributory benefits scheme before the reform were able to shift a substantial part of the cost of social insurance to workers in the form of lower wages. There are, however, important differences across groups of workers. Relative to the control group, we find that workers hired after the reform by treatment firms were offered lower wages that are proportional to the mandatory employer contribution rate. In contrast, for incumbent employees who had been on firm payrolls at the time of the reform, treatment firms reduced wage growth gradually allowing them to partially offset their contributions. The reduction in real wages among workers of treatment firms was concentrated among production workers and employees of low-wage industries, which is consistent with our expectation that the reform has significantly increased the unit labor cost of treatment firms. The employment effect of the reform was thus minimal and appears to dissipate subsequently.====The paper is organized as follows.

Our main findings and robustness checks are discussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.

Females graded anonymously are more likely to continue with ====. This suggests that biased grading is a direct cause of the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon in economics. As male graders are the majority, we complement our analysis and evaluate the importance of same-sex bias using random assignment of graders. Although, we estimate a substantial same-sex bias before anonymous exams were introduced, it cannot explain the overall effect of grading bias. Thus, same-sex bias is not the mechanism explaining the overall effect of grading bias.","The lack of women in economics has long been a topic of discussion, and the share of women in academic economics is still notably lower than that of men (see Bayer and Rouse 2016; Lundberg and Stearns 2019). This paper provides one novel answer to the fundamental questions asked in Lundberg (2020): “Why is this? What are the deeper causes?”, namely, grade discrimination in introductory courses in economics. As discussed by Goldin (2013) and Avilova and Goldin (2020), underrepresentation is detectable at the undergraduate level, as female students opt out of economics studies and choose other fields of specialization.====Several papers have, however, studied other possible explanations for this phenomenon (see, for example, Sarsons 2017; Paserman et al. 2020; Porter and Serra 2020; Bedard et al. 2021). Lundberg (2020) also provides an excellent selection of papers providing different answers to fundamental causes. Recently, Dupas et al. (2021) also found that female seminar presenters are asked more patronizing or hostile questions when they reviewed seminar culture in economics. Another often-discussed cause of early sorting into fields is student performance on exams. For instance, Mechtenberg (2009) provides a theoretical model for students sorting into different university subjects based on biased grading in high school, which affects subsequent labor market outcomes. Kugler et al. (2021), on the other hand, use a regression control framework to show that women and men are equally likely to change their choice of major after receiving negative feedback in terms of grades on courses. Grading bias in general at universities has thus far received little attention as such, with Feld et al. (2016) and Breda and Ly (2015) being the exceptions. We are not aware of any empirical study connecting grading bias to continuation measures such as minoring and majoring in economics.====In this paper we compare the grading of male and female students by leveraging the introduction of exam anonymization introduced at Stockholm University in the fall of 2009. We make use of an introductory macroeconomics exam, from which we can disentangle the part of the exam that can be graded with a bias (essay questions) from the nonmanipulative part (multiple choice questions with one correct answer). As a result, we implement a difference-in-difference design based on repeated cross-sectional data on students over time. We find that anonymization increased women's scores, relative to men's, by approximately 0.10 standard deviations for the essay questions. Credibly, there is no statistically significant change in the relative skill in macroeconomics for female students, measured as performance in the same course on multiple-choice questions.==== The latter finding is important since bias driven by compositional changes of students is a fundamental validity concern when using repeated cross-sectional data. Other variables also indicate no compositional change. Moreover, we find that the average essay test scores of female and male students evolve similarly before the introduction of the anonymization of exams. These two tests suggest that our difference-in-difference design is credible, i.e., that the assumption of parallel trends is likely to hold.====These results are related to Breda and Ly (2015). They use oral (nonblind) and written (blind) entry-level exams at elite universities in France and find that females’ oral performance is graded better than males’ oral performance in more male-dominated subjects. Our setting differs in several aspects. We use a change in policy over time, and the examiners in our study are typically the teachers of the students and not external examiners, as they are in Breda and Ly (2015). We study a standard examination at a large (approximately 30 000 students per year) state-financed nonselective university. Moreover, economics is not covered as a subject in their paper, and as documented in Lundberg and Stearns (2020), “gender gaps in professional outcomes conditional on productivity are larger in economics than in other academic disciplines”. Last, Breda and Ly (2015) estimate a nonlinear model (an interaction model), and the overall average effect may still be consistent with our finding.====Nonanonymous grading is not inconsequential. We estimate that being graded anonymously increases the probability of female students continuing with higher economics studies. We find an increased probability of both minoring and majoring in economics for female students if graded anonymously. Thus, we identify grading bias as one possible early cause of the “leaky pipeline” regularity in economics. Importantly, the only requirement to continue with economics studies at this level is a passing grade, and many students are already accepted into a study program at start and are guaranteed eligibility for a major if passing. Thus, these effects, in particular on the probability to minor, are likely also driven by student demand. We are not aware of any studies linking these outcomes to grading bias.====We then continue to investigate the mechanism at work. In-group bias may explain the entire overall grading bias effect, since in the introductory macroeconomics course, male graders are in the vast majority, while the student gender mix is approximately equal. The macroeconomics course allocates graders to questions within exams and hence we can therefore estimate the same-sex bias before anonymization and separate in-group bias from the overall grading bias effect. Via the random allocation of graders to essay questions, we first find that graders, on average, scored students of the same gender 0.09 standard deviations higher than those of the opposite gender in the nonanonymous regime. Credibly, once anonymous examination was used, the effect is close to zero. Then, we separately study the questions graded by male graders and female graders. We find that the same-sex bias effect is entirely driven by male graders scoring male students, relative to female students, substantially higher (13% of a st.d.), while female graders typically graded female students ==== favorably than male students (5% of a st.d.).==== However, we do not have enough power to statistically distinguish between positive or negative discrimination by grader type as in Feld et al. (2016).====Since both male and female graders favor male students relative to female students, it is not surprising that the main overall bias effect is not largely affected by simultaneously controlling for the same-sex bias in one regression specification. Thus, we are able to separate in-group bias from bias stemming from other match-independent factors, such as shared stereotypes among graders.====Taken together, these facts point to an overall grading bias against female students, show that the bias is not inconsequential and provide a new explanation for the leaky pipeline regularity. Consistent with the findings are theories of how gender stereotypes (genius is male) affect judgment, although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.====In addition to adding to the mentioned literature, this paper contributes to the literature on gender discrimination in grading at other levels of schooling (see Lavy 2008; Hinnerich et al. 2011; Hanna and Linden 2012; Berg et al. 2019). Additionally, see Sandberg (2017) for same-sex bias in a different setting, and for the importance of samen-sex matching between students and teachers, see Dee (2005; 2007), Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009), Holmlund and Sund (2008) and Lim and Meer (2017).====The paper is organized as follows.

Robots and artificial intelligence are radically changing the role of workers in the production process, generating lively discussions on their effects on labor markets (Acemoglu, Restrepo, 2020, Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, Woessner, 2021, Graetz, Michaels, 2018, de Vries, Gentile, Miroudot, Wacker, 2020).====The reallocation of tasks associated with automation is likely to have effects on work-related health risks. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020), private industry employers in the US reported over 5000 fatal work-related injuries and 2.8 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses in 2019, whose total estimated cost to the nation, employers, and individuals was $171 billion (National Safety Council, 2020), equivalent to 4% of 2019 US government budget. While the rapid adoption of industrial robots presents both new hopes and challenges to workers’ safety and health (CDC, 2021), empirical evidence on robots’ impacts on workplace safety and health remains sparse.====The relationship between robots and workers’ physical health and safety is complex. On the one hand, since their introduction, industrial robots have typically been used for physically intensive tasks that are often associated with detrimental effects on health and increased risk of accidents at work.==== In this context, automated systems can offer considerable safety benefits to human workers, as robots can help prevent injuries or adverse health effects resulting from working in hazardous conditions. Examples include musculoskeletal disorders due to repetitive or awkward motions (Schneider and Irastorza, 2010), or traumatic injuries (e.g., in poultry processing, where cuts are common). Robots can also prevent multiple hazards in emergency response situations such as chemical spills (Ishida et al., 2006). Besides protecting workers, robots can also minimize risks stemming from human error (Karwowski, Rahimi, Mihaly, 1988, Linsenmayer). If a job is repetitive and monotonous, humans tend to commit a mistake, whereas robots can do these things the same way repeatedly. On the other hand, robots can pose a variety of hazards to workers (Kirschgens et al., 2018). For example, while industrial robots have been designed to operate at a distance from workers, these machines often lack the sensory capabilities necessary to detect nearby humans. Moreover, the spread of collaborative robots, which are intended to directly interact and share workspaces with humans, can lead to additional safety risks (Matthias et al., 2011). Therefore, the direction and the magnitude of the effects of robot adoption on workers’ physical health are theoretically ambiguous and represent an open empirical question.====There is also increased concern that the complex relationship between humans and machines may have detrimental effects on workers’ mental health (Robelski and Wischniewski, 2018) and act as an additional stressor at the workplace (Körner, Müller-Thur, Lunau, Dragano, Angerer, Buchner, 2019, Szalma, Taylor, 2011). Furthermore, the labor market effects of robot adoption and automation may increase stress and anxiety even among individuals who are not directly exposed (Venkataramani, O’Brien, 2020, Venkataramani, Bair, O’Brien, Tsai, 2020).====In this study, we begin by investigating the relationship between the adoption of industrial robots and work-related injuries using data from the United States (US) and Germany, two of the leading robot adopters in the world. To examine the impact of robots on work-related injuries in the US, we use detailed establishment-level data on work injuries from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Data Initiative (ODI) covering the 2005 to 2011 period, while information on the distribution of industrial robots across sectors and over time are sourced from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).==== Using establishment-level data on injury rates, we find that a one standard deviation increase in robot exposure (1.34 robots per 1000 workers) reduces work-related injury rates by approximately 1.2 injuries per 100 full-time workers (0.15 standard deviations; 95% CI: ====1.8, ====0.53). To gauge the economic significance of the effects, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the increase in robots between 2005 and 2011 saved $1.69 billion per year in injury costs (in 2007 dollars). This result largely reflects a reduction in injury rates at manufacturing firms which decline by 1.75 injuries per 100 full-time workers (or 0.22 standard deviations; 95% CI: ====2.48, ====1.02). The results are robust to several sensitivity checks (for details, see Section 4.2).====We then turn to investigate whether robots have an impact on workers’ mental health in the US. Using commuting zone-level data on mortality (source: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Vital Statistics) and survey data on mental health problems (source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS]), we show that robot penetration leads to sizable increases in drug or alcohol-related deaths and mental health problems. A one standard deviation increase in robot exposure raises deaths due to drug or alcohol abuse by 0.37 standard deviations (10.5% increase with respect to the mean) and the number of days during the previous month when the respondent felt his or her mental health was not good by 0.40 standard deviations (14.9% increase with respect to the mean). However, we find no evidence of significant effects on the suicide rate. Overall, we interpret these findings as evidence suggesting that the labor market pressure and fears induced by robot penetration (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020) may have detrimental effects on workers’ mental health (see also Venkataramani and O’Brien, 2020).====Next, we leverage additional data from Germany to provide further evidence. Several reasons make Germany an appealing context to explore and complement the analysis based on the US establishment and regional data. First, Germany is a world leader in robotics whose robot penetration is even higher than that of the US, as shown in Fig. 1. Second, evidence suggests that the effect of robot penetration on German manufacturing jobs was largely mitigated by the growth of jobs in services, thereby suggesting that the effects on mental health may be different compared to those observed in the US. Third, the availability of longitudinal survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) containing information on occupation, sector, and various health and well-being outcomes allows us to shed further light on the complex effects of robot penetration on workers’ safety using individual-level data and exploiting within-individual changes in exposure to robot penetration. Finally, using the SOEP data, we adopt an alternative identification strategy relying on the probability of exposure to robots based on the occupation associated with one’s vocational training. Thus, we only leverage variation in robot exposure based on the track choice individuals made early in their life. This decision is unlikely to reflect correlates of robots’ adoption and labor market outcomes later in life, and therefore, less likely to be endogenous.====The results based on the German individual panel data show that a one standard deviation increase in robot exposure is associated with a 0.01 standard deviations reduction in the risk of reporting any disability (====5% with respect to the mean) and a 0.02 standard deviations reduction in the likelihood of being employed in a highly physically intensive task (====4% with respect to the mean). We also find no evidence of significant effects of robot exposure on workers’ well-being and mental health. Overall, our results for Germany are consistent with those documented by Dauth et al. (2021), who show that robot exposure did not cause disruptive job losses in Germany and that the individual risk of becoming unemployed is even lower among more robot-exposed manufacturing workers who were re-trained. They find that the longer-term shift from manufacturing to services was driven by young labor market entrants, not by actual switches. We argue that this is likely the main explanation for the different effects of robot exposure on mental health in Germany.====Our methodological approach is closely connected to some recent studies analyzing the impact of robots on labor market conditions, life course choices, and demographic behavior. Recent studies have analyzed the effects of the increase in industrial robot usage on employment and wages across various countries (Acemoglu, Restrepo, 2020, Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, Woessner, 2021, Giuntella, Wang, 2019, Graetz, Michaels, 2018, de Vries, Gentile, Miroudot, Wacker, 2020). While Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) and Giuntella and Wang (2019) estimate sizable and negative impacts of the rise in robot exposure on employment and wages across the US commuting zones and China, respectively, Dauth et al. (2021) and Graetz and Michaels (2018) find no significant effects on employment in Germany and for a set of 17 countries, respectively. Using data from 37 countries, de Vries et al. (2020) find that a rise in robot adoption reduces the employment share of routine manual jobs. Recent literature also examines the impact of robotization on family outcomes (Anelli et al., 2021). In a recent study, using data on self-reported health in the US and exposure to robots at the MSA-level, Gunadi and Ryu (2020) find that a 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with approximately a 10% reduction in the fraction of low-skilled individuals reporting poor health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only other study analyzing the relationship between robot penetration and physical health. Unlike Gunadi and Ryu (2020), we focus on establishment-level data on work-related injuries and use longitudinal data from Germany on both physical and mental health outcomes of workers. There are two other recent studies analyzing the relationship between automation and mental health. Venkataramani et al. (2020) find evidence of a strong association between automotive assembly plant closure and opioid overdose mortality between 1999 and 2016. In a concurrent work, Venkataramani and O’Brien (2020) show that robot penetration led to a substantial increase in drug overdose mortality between 1993 and 2007. While the present study examines a wider range of outcomes, our evidence on mortality in the US is largely consistent with their findings. Using data from Germany, Abeliansky and Beulmann (2019) find evidence of a decline in mental health associated with increased exposure to robots. While the latter study uses similar data for Germany, we adopt a different identification strategy and focus on a broader set of outcomes, and find no evidence of a decline in mental well-being.====By contrast, a growing number of studies investigate the effects of other labor market shocks on injuries and health (Colantone, Crino, Ogliari, 2019, Hummels, Munch, Xiang, 2016, McManus, Schaur, 2016, Pierce, Schott, 2020). For instance, McManus and Schaur (2016) examine the effect of import competition in the US and find that an increase in import competition significantly increases worker injury and illness rates. Further, Hummels et al. (2016) exploit Danish employer-employee data combined with individual health data to demonstrate how rising exports may lead to increases in injuries, severe depression, and hospitalizations because of heart attack and strokes, whereas Colantone et al. (2019) explore the effects of exposure to global trade on mental health. Pierce and Schott (2020) find that areas more exposed to international trade policy exhibit relative increases in fatal drug overdoses, specifically.====Our work also appeals to the recent few studies analyzing the effects of immigration on task allocation, work-related health risk, and the health of the native population (Giuntella, Mazzonna, 2015, Giuntella, Mazzonna, Nicodemo, Vargas-Silva, 2019). Related to this literature, our study explores the effects of the changes in task allocation induced by robotization, and in particular, its effects on work-related accidents and mental health.====Finally, our study contributes to the literature that investigates the relationship between workers and machines, and their consequences on the health and mental well-being of workers. Robelski and Wischniewski (2018) provide a comprehensive review of the literature on human-machine interaction and physical and mental health, underlining the need for more research on the relationship between health and human-machine interaction.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data. We discuss the empirical strategy in Section 3. The evidence from the establishment and regional data for the US is presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the data and the empirical strategy, and report the results from the individual-level analysis in Germany.

Theoretically, the effect of restricting immigration will depend on whether domestic labor and/or mechanization can substitute for immigrant labor. Empirically, there has been little documentation of the technical changes that may be induced by labor scarcity caused by immigration restrictions, with few exceptions, notably Clemens et al. (2018). The effects of immigration policy on labor and capital substitution are difficult to measure because of data constraints, as well as the challenge of disentangling national immigration policy from broader economic trends and local policies from local institutional factors. While there is a large literature that studies the impacts of immigration policies on workers and wages (e.g., Borjas, 1987, Chiswick, 1978, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012)), less is known about the impacts of immigration policies on firms, where the technical changes would be observed, and especially in sectors, like agriculture, that are heavily reliant on migrant labor.====This paper documents how US farm businesses were affected by a localized change in immigration enforcement intensity, using farm-level unbalanced panel data and county-level Census of Agriculture aggregates. We use the immigration policy-induced labor supply shock to test for evidence of endogenous technological change in the agricultural sector. The immigration program in question, commonly called the 287(g) program, authorized law enforcement entities to function as US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents in order to identify and detain unauthorized immigrants within their jurisdiction as part of their routine duties. These entities include Sheriff’s Offices and Police Departments in 13 US cities and 49 counties across 20 states. We focus on 287(g) implementation at the local, county level from 2007 to 2012. This program not only directly affected the supply of immigrant workers but also served as a deterrent that caused migrants to avoid participating areas (Dee and Murphy, 2020).====This study takes advantage of the spatial and temporal variation of 287(g) program adoption to estimate how US farm businesses adapted to increased local immigration enforcement. We use two ==== sets of agricultural survey panel data, one firm- and one county-level, which allows us to examine farms that were randomly sampled both before and after the policy change and the local agricultural sector, respectively. We evaluate evidence for endogenous technical change using outcomes that measure farm- and county-level fuel expenditure, labor expenditure, and acres operated, as well as county-level farm employment. These dependent variables provide insight into how employers adjusted labor and capital use following 287(g) authorization, and they were selected to test some of the implications of the model of endogenous technical change in farm sector developed by Clemens et al. (2018). Due to data limitations, we are not able to consider wage impacts, directly estimate labor supply or other elasticities, or identify changes in the production of specific specialty crops that are more easily mechanized.====Causal identification of labor supply shocks is a major challenge to understanding the impact of immigration. Generally, this endogeneity has been overcome in two ways: either by exploiting an unexpected exogenous shock, like the Mariel boatlift (Card, 1990), or by instrumenting for the current immigrant population using the past populations of immigrants from the same place of origin, relying on the enclaving tendency of immigrants (Card, 2009). The former occurs infrequently and typically only in one place, affecting external validity. The latter is usually used for urban areas in the US, as such enclaves are more prevalent there. This does little to help inform the debate in agriculture, which is one of the largest employers of migrant laborers, who typically move from one job-site to another.====We implement a novel and robust instrumental variables strategy for local immigration enforcement decisions: we use measures of local jail occupancy before 287(g) authorization, which we argue are unrelated to agricultural production decisions, as instrumental variables for the decision to participate in 287(g). Aggregated up to the county level, local jail occupancy prior to the start of the program is a strong predictor of 287(g) participation, with little evidence of any relationship to farm sector activity. Instead, jail occupancy in program counties appears to be related to increased jail capacity expansion through renovations of existing facilities or construction of new ones in the decade prior to 287(g) implementation. There is no evidence that population growth (or decline) drove this expansion, which we argue is indicative of active and well-supported law enforcement where investment in jail facilities outpaced jail population. There was a widespread ex-ante belief that 287(g) participation could increase local law enforcement jurisdictions’ revenue (Shahani and Greene, 2009). This belief, along with the political popularity of anti-immigrant action, drove program participation and so underpins our first stage; its validity is not influenced by ex-post anecdotes that this revenue was not realized====. Further, farm and (relevant) non-farm sector trends appear to be largely unrelated to future 287(g) participation. This approach allows us to provide one the first plausibly causal estimates of the economic impact of local immigration policy on US firms.====We find evidence that increased enforcement of 287(g) led to large declines in employment and an increase in mechanization. We observe a decline in number of workers employed and a local increase in labor expenditure, which suggests some combination of wage increases and a reallocation to more expensive labor, which typically would include machinery operators. Farms increased fuel expenditures (a proxy for higher use of automated technologies), but agricultural land use in the county decreased. With respect to endogenous technical change, we conclude that both full labor and capital substitution was not feasible, given the concurrent large declines in employment and land use. The increase in county-level labor expenditure further suggests non-marginal changes in farm structure. Our results are in line with concerns that more stringent immigration enforcement disadvantage sectors that rely on manual or immigrant labor.====Our paper builds on several related literatures. Most closely related is Clemens et al. (2018), which provides a theoretical framework and empirical tests for endogenous technical change in farms due to the abrupt end of a large US national agricultural guest-worker program (the bracero exclusion) in 1964 and state-level variation in bracero employment/program participation. The outcomes we consider are not directly comparable with Clemens et al. (2018), and we observe changes to local immigration policy in the modern farm economy instead of national policy in the 1960s. Given these caveats, our results are generally consistent while suggesting lower substitutability of farm labor and capital. Clemens et al. (2018) finds that the bracero exclusion policies did not increase employment of domestic farm workers and documents a short term decline in acres harvested of “easily-mechanized bracero-intensive crops” and a longer term decline of those that were less easily mechanized. We find an increase in fuel expenditure consistent with automation, but also evidence of contracting production. We build on papers that have studied the 287(g) program with a focus on employment and urban areas: Kostandini et al. (2014) and Dee and Murphy (2020) document that the program led to a decline in the population of non-citizens in program jurisdictions, and Bohn and Santillano (2017) show that employment impacts varied heavily across industries.====With this paper, we contribute to ongoing policy debates that are supported by thin empirical evidence on how firms’ non-wage decisions are affected by a fluctuating labor supply (Olney, 2013). Our approach allows us to provide evidence on the substitutabilty of native workers and/or capital for immigrant workers in a sector heavily dependent on an immigrant labor force. Foreign-born workers tend to specialize in manual labor, which can limit their substitutability (Peri and Sparber, 2009). The extent to which this substitutability exists, if it does at all, is a crucial point of difference in many arguments about the direction US immigration policy should take, and plays a key role in theoretically determining firm-level impacts of immigration policy (Lewis, 2003).====In the next section we provide conceptual and institutional background that underpins our study. Then we describe our data and empirical model, including our instrumental variables strategy. This is following by a discussion of our results, including several robustness checks. In the conclusion, we summarize our findings and draw policy implications.",Is ICE freezing US agriculture?

More importantly, much of this rise was driven by the uneven ownership of the dramatically appreciating housing assets in developed cities. This housing boom in developed cities has been accompanied by massive inflows of migrant workers as well as tightening housing constraints.==== Could this massive migration inflow and tight housing constraints in these developed cities explain rapidly rising inequality in China? If so, is there any policy we could implement to alleviate this rising inequality?====In this paper, we take two approaches to answer both questions. First, using various sources of data, we document that housing costs and income inequality are significantly positively correlated with the number of migrant workers in different cities. Second, we construct a spatial equilibrium model incorporating both heterogeneous wage income and heterogeneous housing asset income to quantify the effects of migration and housing constraints on the observed income inequality. In the counterfactual analysis, we find that easing the housing constraints in developed cities can reduce income inequality in China.====In the first step, we show four main stylized facts from the data. First, migration in China is overwhelmingly into developed areas. The concentration is accelerating across time because of improvements in the transportation system and the relaxation of the Hukou system.==== Second, housing costs have increased drastically over time, especially for cities with large numbers of migrants. There is a positive correlation between housing costs and the net stock of migrant workers across cities. Third, income inequality within cities is positively correlated with the net stock of migrant workers. Fourth, it is housing ownership inequality, rather than wage inequality that caused the observations in stylized fact 3. These four stylized facts give us a preliminary picture of the whole story. As the economy grew, more and more migrants concentrated in large and developed coastal cities. The massive increase in housing demand, together with a highly regulated land supply, pushed up real estate rents in big cities to the benefit of local housing owners. Increasing housing rents then translated into increasing income inequality between local property owners and migrant renters.====In the second step, we construct a spatial equilibrium model to quantify the facts, explain the mechanism, and conduct counterfactual analysis. The model comprises heterogeneous workers making migration choices, a representative firm, and a state-regulated housing sector in each city. The key mechanism is that with the universal drop in migration costs and uneven productivities, workers migrate from under-developed cities to developed cities with higher wages. Since housing supply is heavily regulated and inelastic in these developed cities, housing costs increase dramatically, which drives up local property owners housing income. However, due to various frictions, migrant workers cannot participate in their local property market or share any increases in housing values in the living city. They can only earn housing returns in their under-developed home city. As more and more migrants move into developed cities, the housing ownership gap between locals and migrants results in rapidly rising income inequality.====Using various sources of data from 2005 and 2010, we solve the model quantitatively. We find that from 2005 to 2010, the average migration costs decreased by 35% for low-skill workers and 21% for high-skill workers. Meanwhile, productivity growth was faster in absolute terms in large cities, which attracted large numbers of migrant workers. These large, developed cities also have slower growth in land supply. Construction land supply increased by only 10% in the largest cities, which together attracted more than twenty million workers. While at the same time, average land supply growth was 40% for cities which lost almost half of their working population. This inefficient land supply policy causes severe housing constraints in developed cities and increases income inequality.====Finally, we conduct counterfactual policy reforms to ease housing constraints in developed cities and reduce income inequality. The main counterfactual we impose is a migration-based land supply reform. The idea is straightforward and intuitive: to allocate new land quotas by migration flows. We reallocate the increment of the total land supply quota from 2005 to 2010. Instead of giving more land quota to under-developed areas, we allocate land quota proportionally to the change in the migration inflows to different cities, while keeping the national total land supply constant. That is, cities attracting more migrants are given more quota.==== Meanwhile, all revenues from additional lands in developed cities are collected and transferred to under-developed cities who lost quota as compensation. This policy mimics a ”land quota transfer market” (Lu, 2016) where developed cities can buy land quota from under-developed cities and compensate them with direct transfers. Thus, we can achieve balanced development between regions and simultaneously avoid policy distortion. With the counterfactual land supply policy, housing cost increases in big cities are significantly attenuated. Compared with the real world, this policy reduces housing costs in 2010 by 30% in first-tier cities and by 25% in second-tier cities, and also incentivizes more workers to migrate to these developed cities. Simultaneously, within-city income inequality falls by 34% and national inequality by 20%. In another counterfactual policy, we show that a US-level property tax and redistribution policy could also help to reduce income inequality.====   Our study extends the current literature in three dimensions. First, we investigate a new mechanism for income inequality and extend knowledge about increasing inequality in China. There are many studies on income and wage inequality. Different papers investigate many causes of inequality, including skill-biased technological change and the increase in the return to human capital (Berman, Bound, Machin, 1998, Card, DiNardo, 2002, Moore, Ranjan, 2005), education inequality (Gregorio, Lee, 2002, Sylwester, 2002), trade liberalization (Goldberg, Pavcnik, 2004, Han, Liu, Zhang, 2012, Verhoogen, 2008), and privatization (Chao, Hazari, Yu, 2006, Cuadrado-Ballesteros, Peña-Miguel, 2018). The closest study to ours is Chen et al. (2018). They find that larger cities have higher income inequality and claim that this is because migration inflows into larger cities change the skill composition of the workers, yielding a higher skill premium. In this study, we investigate a new mechanism of migration interacting with housing constraints that can also increase income inequality.====Second, this paper contributes to the literature that studies the spatial distribution of labor supply using the EK-Migration framework. Since Ahlfeldt et al. (2015), the literature has extended the canonical Eaton and Kortum (2002) international trade framework to introduce worker mobility to explicitly model worker location choices in the presence of migration costs and heterogeneous worker preferences regarding locations. Many of these contributions investigate internal migration costs, such as Morten and Oliveira (2014), Bryan and Morten (2019), Ma and Tang (2020), Tombe and Zhu (2019), Yu (2019), Wu and You (2020) and Fan (2019). The closet studies to us are Tombe and Zhu (2019) and Fan (2019). The former focuses on how trade and migration costs affect labor productivity in China without differentiating between worker skill types, and the latter focuses on understanding how international trade affects overall domestic wage inequality and the aggregate skill premium without considering the distribution of property ownership. Our paper aims to understand income inequality stemming from both human capital and wealth ownership differences. Guided by this target, our model introduces both high/low-skill workers and heterogeneous housing ownership. Second, instead of inferring wages from the model, which is the most important ingredient for calculating inequality, we manually collect the wages by industry for as many Chinese cities as we can from individual city statistical yearbooks. Combining this unique dataset with the population census, we construct a comprehensive and spatially decomposable inequality measure for China and investigate the most realistic policy reforms.====Third, this paper contributes to the literature that studies the housing and land market in China. The so-called ==== of China is well documented in Garriga et al. (2020), Garriga et al. (2017), Fang et al. (2016), Chen and Wen (2017), and Glaeser et al. (2017). The housing boom is unevenly distributed spatially. As Fang et al. (2016) shows, the boom is not universal. More developed cities have seen disproportionate gains in housing prices while less developed cities have seen their housing prices grow more slowly than GDP. Various theories attempt to explain this pattern: Garriga et al. (2017), Liang et al. (2016), and Wu et al. (2016). We contribute to this literature by showing that the inefficient land supply policy and massive migration inflows into larger cities jointly caused the ====. We also provide counterfactual policies for the housing sector, which could lower housing costs and reduce housing inequality.====   This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and variables. Section 3 documents five stylized facts of migration, housing, and inequality in China. Section 4 shows the spatial equilibrium model. Section 5 quantifies the model and shows the quantitative results. Section 6 shows counterfactual policy reforms.

However, informal housing plays an important role in providing affordable living space to people with low incomes. Careful evaluation of these informal housing clearance policies and assessment of their impacts is therefore sorely needed. This paper empirically evaluates the effect of the informal housing clearance move of Beijing, induced by an unexpected fire in November 2017. We find that the informal housing clearance move has a significant impact on a city’s housing market, particularly on rents. Further, the informal housing clearance significantly reduces the size of the city’s labor supply in the short term, but as the wage level in the city rises, part of the city’s labor force returns, resulting in insignificant mid- to long-term effects on the labor supply. These effects also extend to the housing and labor markets of the receiving cities. We further build a spatial general equilibrium model with different types of labor and formal and informal housing that considers individual location choices. The model calibration is consistent with the empirical findings. The model simulation shows that in response to the informal housing clearance policy, the utility levels of both Beijing and the receiving cities decrease. We then examine the policy effects of increasing formal housing supply elasticities, the indemificatory housing, and the threshold of entering the formal housing market. We find that increasing formal housing supply elasticity and indemificatory housing while decreasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market can mitigate the increase in rents and decrease in labor supply caused by the informal housing clearance policies, and compensate for the decrease in utility levels.","The term “informal housing” refers to housing that is illegally constructed, exists outside of unified urban planning and government control, and lacks property rights protection (Durst, Wegmann, 2017, Roy, 2009, Zhang, 2018). Because these spaces are largely unregulated and subject to minimal governmental oversight and legal protection, health and safety concerns are often associated with them. And indeed, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents of slums and informal housing have been among those hardest hit because they lack basic sanitary conditions and spaces where they can self-isolate. Despite the health and safety issues associated with informal housing, its very existence in various forms throughout the world points to the inadequacy of formal housing markets and public housing projects to meet the demand for affordable living space (Kim, 2016). According to UNHABITAT, an estimated 1.8 billion people were living in slums and informal housing in cities around the world before the pandemic.==== Informal housing plays an important role in mitigating the housing issues for the low-income groups (Sullivan and Olmedo, 2015), as well as in alleviating poverty (Mooya and Cloete, 2007). Hence, careful evaluation of these informal housing clearance policies and assessment of their impacts is sorely needed.====China’s rapid urbanization makes it a good setting for studying aspects of informal housing. Its urbanization rate rose from 17.9% in 1978 to 64.7% in 2021. In recent years, the transformation of large-scale shantytowns and historic neighborhoods has ushered in a new stage in Chinese urban renewal. From 2015 to 2021, a total of 31.32 million shantytowns, a large portion of which are informal housing, were renovated nationwide. The fate of Chinese informal housing has attracted both research and policy attention (Niu, Sun, Zheng, 2021, Wu, Zhang, Webster, 2013). At the end of 2017, a fire broke out in Beijing, causing an unplanned, large-scale clearance of informal housing and thereby providing a natural experiment for evaluating the effects of government policies that remove these structures. This paper uses that event as an informal housing supply shock to evaluate the effects of a city’s informal housing clearance policies on its housing and labor markets and also to study the linkage effects on interrelated cities.====International research on informal housing clearance mainly focuses on the specific practices and evaluations of slum clearance in particular cities or regions of developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, or developing countries, such as India and Brazil (de Camargo Cavalheiro, Abiko, 2015, Collins, Shester, 2013, Kearns, Wright, Abrams, Hazley, 2019, Zhang, 2018). Research on developed countries more focuses on gentrification, which refers to “a variety of changes in inner cities caused by the displacement of low-income households by high-income households” (Sullivan, 2005). Moreover, research on informal housing clearance in developed countries has focused on both short- and long-term perspectives (Kearns et al., 2019), while corresponding research on developing countries has mainly focused on implementation modes and short-term policy effects. For example, research on developing countries tends to consider policy interventions such as upgrading in place, securing private property rights, and carrying out slum renovations (Sanyal, 2014). Latest research start to study the issue of slum growth or slum demolition from a global perspective that combines the social and economic factors. Alves (2021) studies slum growth in Brazailian cities, and points out that economic growth in cities causes slum growth by attracting large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing. Rivera-Padilla (2021) takes into account individual location choices in returns to education, productivity, and housing rents, and analyzes the aggregate effects of urban slum demolition policies in India. More such studies are still needed that consider the issue of informal housing that takes into account a range of social and economic factors, such as the housing needs of rural–urban migrants, public health and environmental sanitation, local governance, private savings and investment, and land market regulations (Marx et al., 2013).====In the Chinese context, analysis of economic impacts of informal housing clearance is insufficient and for the most part limited to studies of individual cities (Huang, Yi, 2015, Lai, Zheng, Choy, Wang, 2017, Liu, Wong, 2018, Yu, Cai, 2013). Niu et al. (2021) quantitatively examines the linkages between urban housing markets and labor markets from the perspective of migrant flows and wages, with a focus on the low-skilled migrant who are mostly likely to live in informal housing. More such studies are needed that consider the linkage effects between cities when examining impacts from informal housing clearance policies in China.====To carefully study the impact of informal housing clearance policies on the housing and labor markets, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between the two. Existing literature on the dynamic relationship between the two markets mostly focuses on the policy impact from the perspective of labor demand (Saks, 2008, Zabel, 2012), but lacking in the perspective of housing supply shocks as those caused by informal housing clearance. In fact, the informal housing clearance policies directly reduce the housing supply for low-income people. As the literature has argued, individual labor migration decisions are mainly based on factors such as wages, housing expenditure, and quality of life (Plantinga, Detang-Dessendre, Hunt, Piguet, 2013, Roback, 1982, Rosen, 1986). Hence, policies of removing informal housing from large cities should cause housing prices to rise and force many low-income workers out of the local labor pool. At the same time, some studies suggest that informal housing clearance and urban renewal have a significant positive impact on a city’s income level (Collins and Shester, 2013), and this overall increase in wages might cause some of the lost labor to return. These findings suggest the importance of studying the interaction between the housing and labor markets from the perspective of labor supply when analyzing the policy effects of informal housing clearance policies.====On the other hand, informal housing clearance policies can be regarded as part of a government’s regulation of the housing supply. These policies not only directly reduce the amount of housing supply in the short term, they also affect the housing supply elasticity by raising the accessibility standards in the informal housing market. In areas where government regulations reduce housing supply elasticity, labor demand shocks can cause wages and housing prices to rise, thus reducing employment and economic growth (Hsieh, Moretti, 2019, Saks, 2008). When factors driving economic growth have an impact on wages and housing prices, those cities with more elastic housing supplies witness faster population growth and lower wage and housing price increases. In contrast, cities with less elastic housing supplies tend to maintain the same population levels while housing prices and incomes rise more (Glaeser et al., 2006). These findings imply the importance of studying the housing supply elasticity. However, very little research exists on informal housing clearance from the perspective of housing supply elasticities.====Based on the literature, we first empirically evaluate the effect of the informal housing clearance of Beijing in November 2017 using a difference-in-difference (DID) approach. We find that the informal housing clearance has a significant impact on a city’s housing market, particularly on rents. Further, the informal housing clearance significantly reduces the size of the city’s labor supply in the short term, but as the wage level in the city rises, part of the city’s labor force returns, resulting in insignificant mid- to long-term effects on the labor supply. These effects also extend to the housing and labor markets of the receiving cities. We further build a spatial general equilibrium model with different types of labor and formal and informal housing that considers individual location choices. The model calibration is consistent with the empirical results. We then examine the policy effects of increasing formal housing supply elasticities and increasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market. We find that increasing formal housing supply elasticity and decreasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market can mitigate the increase in rents and decrease in labor supply caused by the informal housing clearance policies.====As pointed out by Rivera-Padilla (2021), the existence of informal housing is a double-edged sword. On one hand, informal housing provides affordable shelter and thus labor market opportunities in urban center to low-skill labor. The informal housing market in Chinese cities facilitates China’s rapid growth in low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing exports to the global market (Niu et al., 2021). On the other hand, problems with health and safety are associated with informal housing, which bring damages to peoples’ living environment just like the fire occurring in Beijing in 2017. In this case, it is important to evaluate the effect of the informal housing clearance policies on the utility levels. Based on the model framework, we compare the pre- and post- policy utility levels in Beijing and the receiving cities. We find that in response to the informal housing clearance policy, the utility levels of both Beijing and the receiving cities decrease. Increasing formal housing supply elasticity and indemnificatory housing while decreasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market can compensate for the decrease in utility levels caused by the informal housing clearance policies.====This paper is also related to the strand of literature that investigates the effects of land property rights and titling programs on a variety of economic variables, including real estate values, labor supply, and poverty reduction (Field, 2007, Galiani, Schargrodsky, 2010, Lanjouw, Levy, 2002).==== As noted by Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010), a pervasive manifestation of weak property rights is a large number of people living in urban dwellings without possessing formal titles. The absence of formal property rights clearly constitutes a severe limitation for the poor. Our paper examines the effects of informal housing clearance (i.e., the absence of property rights) on the housing market and labor supply and studies the link between the lack of property rights and utility levels. Our results suggest that informal housing clearance, or the lack of property rights, raises housing rents, reduces the labor supply in the short term, and decreases the utility levels of the city enacting the policy. These results confirm the findings in the literature on the impacts of granting property rights but look at the issue from the perspective of a lack of property rights.====This paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature. First, it compensates the literature by analyzing the policy impact of informal housing clearance on the housing and labor markets from the perspective of housing supply shocks. Second, the scope of the study is not limited to policy effects in a single city: through empirical tests and model calibration, it analyzes the linkage effects on cities with interrelated housing and labor markets. Finally, this paper treats informal housing clearance policies as policy measures that directly reduce the housing supply and thus lower housing supply elasticity.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and empirical tests. Section 3 presents a theoretical model and model calibration. Section 4 presents the policy simulations of increasing commercial housing elasticities and the threshold of entering the formal housing market. Section 5 concludes.

We use firm-level panel data for the metal-engineering industry (from 2009 to 2015), with information on firm characteristics, STW use and industrial relations attributes, merged with accounting data. We estimate the elasticity of working hours, labour cost, productivity and profits to STW hours using an Instrumental Variables Fixed-Effects estimator. We find that a more intensive use of STW causes a significant decline of both working hours and labour cost per employee. We also show that an increase in STW hours is associated with lower labour productivity per employee, with no significant effects on hourly productivity and an overall negative (although small) effect on firm's profits. All these effects are temporary and fade away in two years, once the legal duration of STW schemes is reached. Unions presence and power in the firm influences the elasticity of the margins of adjustment. In low unionized firms, labour cost cuts are the prevailing adjustment mechanisms, while in highly unionized firms, per-capita labour cost is insensitive to STW and adjustment occurs through a reduction in working hours. These results are coherent with the use of STW as a work sharing device to protect incumbent workers who are mainly union members.","The Great Recession, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic, exposed most firms to unprecedented large and persistent product demand shocks. Firms reacted to these shocks using different margins to adjust production costs to changing output. For example, focusing on labour costs, firms reacted by adjusting wages or working hours. In this respect, short-time work (STW) schemes have been one of the most used policies in many OECD countries, especially in Europe, to reduce working hours, subsidize workers' earnings while preserving their jobs. These schemes are defined as public programs that allow firms experiencing economic difficulties to temporarily reduce the hours worked while providing their employees with income support from the State for the hours not worked (European Commission, 2020). As a matter of fact, STW schemes have been used more extensively in those contexts where the costs to adjust either employment or wages are higher, due to a more rigid institutional setting (such as strict employment protection legislation or widespread collective agreements). Limitations to the ability of firms to lay-off workers implemented in some countries during the COVID pandemic further increased the use of STW. Only in 2020, in OECD countries at some point in time, over 50 million jobs were supported by STW schemes. At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, more than one third of employees were on such schemes in countries, such as France, Italy, Germany and the UK (these are ==== scheme in the UK, ==== in Germany, ==== in France, and ==== in Italy). While STW schemes are usually appealing for both employers and workers, since they help firms to buffer the shocks by reducing hours of work and preserve worker's job and earnings, their effect on firm's performance is more controversial (Cahuc, 2019). Also, unions play a central role in the actual implementation of these schemes at the firm level, however still little is known about how the presence of unions at the workplace influences short time work adoption and the likely effects on firm performance.====In this paper, we study the effects of STW on firm performance using panel data for the metal engineering industry in Italy, from 2009 to 2015. In particular, we focus on the role of firm-level unionization and collective bargaining in mediating the effect of STW on a number of firms outcomes, such as hours worked, wages, productivity and profitability. The effects of unions on firms' performance has been widely debated in the economic literature (see, among others, Freeman and Medoff, 1984; Booth, 2002; Bennett and Kaufman, 2007. For a recent review on the firm-level effects of codetermination, that is worker representation in firms’ governance and management, see Jäger et al., 2021). Traditional models of trade unions behaviour focus on the objective of maximizing union's member utility, which depends on their employment and wages, thus protecting incumbent workers on permanent contracts (insiders), at the expense of workers on fixed-term contracts and the unemployed (outsiders). In this perspective, to preserve employment levels, unions are likely to resist real wage cuts and support working hours reduction. This is more likely where STW schemes are generously subsidized by the State. In some countries, local unions also play a crucial role in the actual implementation of STW at the workplace. For example, in France firms that apply to STW schemes (====) have to consult the Social Economic Committee (i.e. the employee representation body in firms with more than 10 employees) or, in absence of employee representatives, must inform employees about the activation of an STW procedure. In Germany, firms with a works council, usually negotiate a local agreement for the implementation of STW schemes (====, which should include the details on the duration, location and distribution of the short-time work, including the list of the employees or firm departments involved. Similarly, in Italy, STW schemes (====) are negotiated between the employer and union representatives in the firm. The negotiations also involve selecting employees who are eligible for STW, using as criteria tenure and family status, with the aim of protecting both the value of the job match (i.e. tenure is likely to be correlated with employees’ productivity) and household well-being.====Finally, unions have other channels to provide employment insurance to their workers beyond the use of STW schemes. For example, strong unions may favour information sharing, improving work organization and internal flexibility, thus reducing labour turnover and potentially enhancing productivity (Addison, 2005; Devicienti et al., 2018).====In the empirical analysis, we estimate the elasticity of working hours, labour cost, labour productivity and profitability to changes in STW hours, comparing unionized and non-unionized firms, as well as those covered by firm-level collective bargaining. Since the adoption of STW schemes is unlikely to be randomly distributed across firms, to account for the endogeneity driven by firms’ self-selection into STW schemes and other confounding factors that influence both STW hours and firm performance, we rely on an Instrumental Variables Fixed-Effects estimator. We build our instruments leveraging on specific institutional features of STW schemes and Employment Protection Legislation (EPL). We then exploit exogenous changes in firing costs that firms experience around specific size thresholds (defined in terms of number of employees) set by the law, which change the relative cost of employment ==== hours adjustment through STW schemes. In particular, since some STW schemes are available only for firms with more than 15 employees (and stricter EPL applies to firms larger than this size threshold), firms crossing the 15-employees threshold experience an exogenous change in the cost of adjusting employment relative to working hours, also changing the incentive to use STW hours. Notice that stricter EPL applies to all plants in multiplant firms with at least 60 employees, independently of whether the size of each plant is below or above the 15-employees threshold. Hence, a multiplant firm with less than 15 employees in each plant is likely to experience an additional exogenous change in the relative cost of adjusting employment compared to working hours when it crosses the overall 60-employees threshold. We exploit these institutional features to construct our instruments: first, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm has 15 or more employees, and 0 otherwise; second, a dummy variable equal to 1 for multiplant firms with more than 60 employees, and 0 otherwise. Notice that since we estimate fixed effects models, identification relies on firms crossing either of the two size thresholds over time.====Our findings contribute to the existing literature on STW by uncovering the role of unions as a mechanism to explain the heterogeneous effects of STW on firm performance. Furthermore, we provide new evidence on the elasticity of various firm-level outcomes to STW hours.====Most of the existing studies which have investigated the effect of STW focus on labour market outcomes, typically exploit cross-country differences before and during the Great Recession and find positive effects of STW on employment (among others, Boeri and Bruecker, 2011; Cahuc and Carcillo, 2011; Hijzen and Venn, 2011; Abraham and Houseman, 2014). In some countries, however, the inefficient design of STW led to a sizable deadweight loss (Boeri and Bruecker, 2011). Hijzen and Venn (2011) suggest that the positive impact of STW is limited to workers with permanent contracts, underlining the risk of increasing labor market segmentation between workers in regular jobs and those on temporary and part-time contracts.====A more recent strand of literature based on microdata at the worker or firm-level finds more heterogeneous results, also due to differences in identification strategies and country-specific institutional features. Interestingly, even studies based on the same country, but using different methods or covering different regions, find quite different results. For example, in the case of Germany, Tilly and Niedermayer (2016) merge different data sources on workers in the Nuremberg metropolitan area and find that STW significantly increases employment, while Kruppe and Scholz (2014) estimate dynamic propensity score models using IAB survey data merged with administrative data on STW and find no statistically significant effects on employment.====A few recent papers use high quality administrative data for different European countries and exploit eligibility rules related to STW implementation. Using Difference-in-Differences (Kopp and Siegenthaler, 2021) or IV approaches (Cahuc et al., 2021; Giupponi and Landais, 2022), most of these studies find positive short-run effects of STW on employment but not long-run effects, thus implying that STW may simply delay dismissals. On the whole, these estimates point out that STW is an effective policy to preserve jobs, but the overall effect may be temporary or quite heterogeneous across different types of firms.====Very few studies have investigated the effects of STW on firm outcomes beyond employment and hours of work. Among the previous papers, Giupponi and Landais (2022) use social security data covering the universe of employer-employee matches in the private sector in Italy from 1983 to 2015 and show that employment gains are associated to higher probability of firm survival but declining productivity per employee, caused by working hours reduction. They report no statistically significant effect on investments, while the effect on liquidity is positive though imprecisely estimated. STW is found to save more jobs and increase firm's survival particularly in firms with low liquidity facing a temporary shock. Conversely, STW in less productive firms facing a persistent shock is shown to prevent a more efficient reallocation of jobs towards more productive firms. Kato and Kodama (2019) study the effect of STW on firm's profitability estimating Propensity Score Matching with Difference-in-Differences models using panel data for a sample of Japanese firms from 2008 to 2014. They show that STW significantly increases firm's profitability (as measured by ROA), at least a few years after the implementation of STW and due to higher sales growth, without significant effects on labour costs.====Our findings show that STW schemes contribute to reduce working hours per employee, with a subsequent negative impact on per-capita labour productivity (measured by added value per employee), with no statistically significant effect on hourly productivity. A higher number of STW hours is found to be associated to lower labour cost per employee, though the overall effects on profitability (proxied by ROA), in the short run, is still negative. All these effects seem temporary and fade away after two years since the adoption of the STW schemes, which corresponds to their maximum legal duration. A statistically significant decline in average labour cost is detected only for firms with low liquidity, which register also a larger decline in per-capita productivity, compared to more liquid firms.====When we consider the role of firm-level unions, we find a larger sensitivity of working hours per employee to STW in highly unionized firms compared to low unionized ones. On the contrary, per-capita labour cost significantly reacts to STW hours only in low unionized firms, while they are rather insensitive in more unionized firms. If we interpret local union density as a proxy for unions’ power, these results are coherent with strong unions pushing for the use of STW as a work sharing device to protect both employment and pay of incumbent workers, who are mainly union members (the so-called “insiders effect”; Saint-Paul (1996)). Our estimates are robust to alternative definitions of unions presence and additional indicators of industrial relations at the workplace.====The paper proceeds as follows.

Our results show that negative demand shocks result in larger earnings losses for workers with specific skills than for those with general skills, but workers with specific skills also profit much more from positive demand shocks. Thus, demand shocks lead to risk-return trade-offs for workers with specific skills.","Human capital theory predicts that workers with specific skills have higher adjustment costs in response to negative demand shocks than workers with general skills, because specific skills cannot be transferred across industries, occupation, or firms. In line with this prediction a large literature documents that workers with specific skills experience larger earnings losses in response to firm closures and mass layoffs (Couch, Placzek, 2010, Gathmann, Schönberg, 2010, Hijzen, Upward, Wright, 2010, Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993, Robinson, 2018). Others show that workers with specific skills experience more difficulties adjusting to technological change (e.g., Hanushek et al., 2017) and economic turbulence (e.g., Lamo et al., 2011). Yet, others show that workers with specific skills have larger reallocation costs in response to local labor market shocks stemming, for example, from industrial regulation policies (e.g., Walker, 2013) or import competition (e.g., Traiberman, 2019, Utar, 2018, Yi, Müller, Stegmaier, 2017).====However, human capital theory also predicts that increasing labor demand drives up the rents to specific skills, because workers with specific skills cannot easily be substituted, such that their outside options and, thus, their bargaining position improves with increasing labor demand (Becker, 1964, Lazear, 2009). Although understanding how returns to specific human capital respond to positive demand shocks provides important insights about the value of specific skills in dynamic labor markets and the substitutability of workers across firms, evidence on this relationship is scarce. A notable exception are Jäger and Heining (2019), who show that small firms pay their incumbent workers higher wages in response to positive demand shocks stemming from co-worker deaths.====This study uses variation from import and export shocks in Germany as a lens through which it studies the causal effects of negative ==== demand shocks on the returns to specific skills. Trade shocks provide an ideal quasi experiment for this purpose. First, trade shocks induce both, negative and positive demand shocks. Second, many papers suggests that trade shocks are related to substantial variation in labor demand by showing that variation of trade shocks leads to substantial employment variation (e.g., Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2014). In this sense, Germany provides an ideal context for our analysis, because the country was exposed to a substantial increase in import competition from Eastern Europe and China at the same time that German exports to those countries were accelerating. These dynamics allow us to exploit substantial regional variation within and across different industries and occupations to analyze how returns to specific and general skills vary by negative and positive demand shocks.====We combine three unique data sources. First, to measure the specificity of skills, we rely on the BERUFENET, an occupational task data set constructed by the German employment agency for career guidance and job placement. Comparable to the U.S. O*Net, the BERUFENET contains information on the required tasks, equipment, working conditions, and required qualifications for all occupations in Germany. Following Eggenberger et al. (2018), we use this data to construct a specificity measure that captures the transferability of the skill bundle of a particular occupation to the skill bundle requirements in the overall labor market. This specificity measure, that closely corresponds to Lazear’s skill-weights definition of specific human capital, captures the probability of finding a new job that requires a similar skill bundle.====Second, to measure the trade flows between Germany and other countries, we follow Autor et al. (2014) and Dauth et al. (2014) by using trade data from the United Nations (UN) Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade). This dataset, which contains detailed information about commodity types, provides information on trade flows between more than 170 countries.====Third, to follow workers’ careers over long periods, we use register data from the Federal Employment Agency of Germany, the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). This data contains highly accurate information about workers’ wages, employment status, and common demographic characteristics (e.g., age, nationality, and education), thereby allowing us to analyze the long-term consequences of international trade for workers with specific and general skills. Moreover, this data allows us to link workers to firms, so that we can account for detailed firm characteristics.====Our empirical analysis relies on two main identification assumptions. First, we assume that German workers and firms were unable to foresee which industries, and therefore which labor market regions, would be affected by the demand shocks stemming from increasing international trade. While this assumption is key to all approaches following Autor et al. (2014), it is even more important for our specific analysis, because the expected consequences of increasing international trade may have influenced firms’ demand for specific skills and workers’ occupational choices. Thus, international trade might influence workers’ human capital investments.====On one hand, to reduce the negative consequences of import shocks, workers may have chosen occupations and industries that demand less specific human capital. On the other hand, firms may have increased their demand for specific skills in anticipation of new export opportunities. To deal with this concern, we restrict our sample to only West German workers who chose their jobs before 1990, and we calculate their skill specificity according to their baseline job in that year. Before 1990, it was virtually impossible to predict the fall of the Iron Curtain and the resulting acceleration of international trade between Germany and the former Soviet bloc countries in the 1990s and 2000s (Chevalier, Marie, 2017, Fuchs-Schündeln, 2008).====Second, we must assume that the trade exposure measures do not reflect domestic shocks to German industries. To tackle this issue and isolate the effects of trade from other confounding factors, we follow common practice by building on the estimation strategy developed by Autor et al. (2013) and Dauth et al. (2014): We instrument the increase in trade exposure from China and Eastern Europe to Germany with the trade between these low-wage countries and other “third-party” high-income countries.====Our results show that workers with specific skills do not only suffer more from negative demand shocks, they also profit much more from positive demand shocks than workers with general skills. In response to the average increase of exports throughout our observation period, the earnings of a worker with a high level of skill specificity (75 percentile) increased by approximately 14 percent more than the earnings of a worker with an average level of skill specificity. In contrast, specific-skilled workers lost approximately 8 percent more in response to the average rising imports throughout our observation period. Workers with very general skills (25 percentile) gained approximately 12 percent less from exports than the workers with an average level of skill specificity. However, they also lost approximately 7 percent less from average increasing exports.====As workers with specific skills profit more from positive demand shocks but suffer more from negative ones, the demand shocks led to more heterogeneous effects for workers with specific skills than for workers with general skills. Thus, our results suggest that investments in occupation-specific skill bundles lead to a risk-return trade-off when labor markets become more dynamic. We also find qualitatively similar results for workers who remain in their firm and occupation. This result highlights that not only job mobility, but also intra-firm wage bargaining is an essential tool for firms in responding to changes in labor demand.====Additionally, our results uncover important heterogeneities. We find that specific skills matter less for young workers in response to negative demand shocks—at least, if they are mobile and switch occupations and labor markets. Thus, our results suggest that young workers either adjust to the consequences of demand shocks (Lazear, 2009), or that they are worse matched such that specific skills matter less for them (Fredriksson et al., 2018). Moreover, we show that specific skills matter less for workers who have entered the labor market after the fall of the iron curtain. Most likely, because workers learn about the developments in the labor markets and adjust to the consequences of demand shocks.====The results remain robust for different sub-samples and regression specifications. First, the trade shocks are not correlated with our outcome variables throughout the pre-treatment period (the 1980s) suggesting that the implicit parallel trends assumption holds. Second, our results remain robust if we control for a set of very detailed industry dummies thus comparing workers within the same narrowly defined industry. Third, the results hold if we restrict our sample to a very homogeneous sample that only includes workers who hold an apprenticeship degree. Fourth, we find similar effects when we run our regressions on the industry instead of the regional level.====Our results contribute to at least two strands of the literature. First, our results relate to the literature analyzing how portable human capital is across firms, occupations, and industries (Cortes, Gallipoli, 2018, Gathmann, Schönberg, 2010, Kambourov, Manovskii, 2009, Leighton, Speer, 2020, Poletaev, Robinson, 2008, Robinson, 2018). This literature largely relied on worker mobility in response to negative demand shocks to evaluate the importance of firm specific human capital for worker mobility. By analyzing how the returns to specific skills respond to positive demand shocks, our results demonstrate that the specificity of a worker’s human capital is not purely determined by a fixed “technological” substitutability between the worker’s skill bundle and the skill bundle of other workers. In contrast, the returns to specific skills are endogenous to market parameters. By demonstrating that the earnings of workers with specific human capital change with the labor demand of the relevant labor market, even in the absence of worker mobility, we offer new insights into the micro-economic foundations of the return to specific skills.====Second, we contribute to the literature analyzing the labor market consequences of international trade. Within this literature a number of papers emphasize the role of specific human capital as main determinant for the adjustment costs in response to trade shocks. Traiberman (2019) estimates an occupational choice model and shows that the largest share of adjustment costs in response to import exposure arises because workers must switch occupations and lose their rents to occupation specific skills. Utar (2018) finds that workers with manufacturing-specific skills suffer lager losses in response to imports shocks.====Although Dauth et al. (2021) briefly touch on the relationship between export exposure and industry specific human capital, this is the first paper providing an extensive analysis of how trade shocks affect the returns to specific skills. Thus, we contribute to the literature by showing that both import and export exposure influence the returns to specific skills, such that workers with specific skills are not the main losers of increasing trade exposure. Indeed, in Germany, on average they even profit more than workers with general skills. Moreover, we show that specific skills matter less for young than for old workers, and younger workers change their occupations and labor markets in response to increasing exports. These results suggest that workers adjust to trade shocks in the longer run.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical model. Section 3 explains our estimation strategy. Section 4 presents the data and explains the empirical construction of our measure for occupational specificity.

We find that the migrant influx has strong adverse effects on native workers in the informal sector, particularly on temporary wage workers, less-educated and young workers, women who are part-time employed and self-employed, and workers in agriculture and construction. At the same time, it has favorable effects on complementary workers in the formal sector; wage employment and wages of men in the formal sector increase—particularly in manufacturing. Increases in product market prices and capital investment in the treatment regions contribute to the rise in ","Forced migration around the world has reached unprecedented levels; according to the UNHCR (2021), 79.5 million people were forcibly displaced at the end of 2019. Of these, 26 million were refugees and 73% of these refugees live in countries neighboring their countries of origin. However, the majority of existing studies on the labor market impact of migrant labor supply shocks have focused on developed countries. This paper examines the effects of the mass migration of Syrians on the labor market outcomes of natives in Turkey as of the end of 2015.==== The Syrian civil war displaced 13.1 million Syrians—half of the country's population—5.6 million of whom took refuge in other countries by February 2018 (UNHCR, 2018). Turkey was the largest recipient of Syrians and has hosted the highest number of refugees in the world since 2015. By the end of 2015, 2.5 million Syrians were registered in Turkey,==== of whom very few had work permits and hence most worked in the informal sector.====In our analysis, we use micro-level data from the 2004–2015 Turkish household labor force surveys (THLFS). For identification, we use the variation in the ratio of migrants to natives across 26 NUTS-2 level regions in Turkey over time in a difference-in-differences framework. A threat to identification in our study is that the distribution of supply shocks across regions may not be random because migrants take into consideration labor market conditions across potential destinations in choosing their destination. Therefore, we also use an instrumental variable approach that employs a variant of the standard distance instrument in the literature. In identifying the effect of the migrant influx, the massive size of the influx in our context is critical, simply because it dwarfs virtually all other events—correlated with the distance instrument and taking place after the arrival of migrants—that could potentially contaminate the results.====The bulk of the studies that examine the labor market effects of immigrants in host countries are in the context of developed countries of North America and Western Europe. Many of these have utilized natural experiments in a context where there is a sudden shift in the labor supply resulting from an exodus of immigrants due to political events in sending countries—as in our context.==== The evidence from these studies yields mixed results. While some studies find no notable adverse effects of migrants on competing natives (e.g., Card, 1990, Hunt 1992, Friedberg 2001), others find much larger adverse effects (e.g., Glitz 2012, Dustmann et al. 2017). A lively debate continues (e.g., Borjas 2017 vs. Peri and Yasenov 2019), perhaps because disentangling the migrant impact poses several measurement and statistical challenges. Although forced displacement due to armed conflict is becoming increasingly common across less developed countries, few studies exist on the labor market effects of forced migrants.==== Therefore, a study examining the labor market effects of a massive forced displacement for the host regions with a credible identification scheme provides valuable knowledge, particularly for less developed countries.====In the recent debate on the impact of migrants, a key issue is the identification of native groups who are most likely to be affected by the migrant shock. An important feature of our study is that the institutional setting makes it easier to isolate native groups who are threatened by migrants and those who stand to gain from them. While native workers in the informal sector are threatened by the arrival of Syrians, the fact that very few Syrian migrants in Turkey had work permits serves to shield the native workers in the formal sector from the arrival of Syrians.====An important dynamic of the Turkish labor market prior to the arrival of Syrian migrants was that the formal sector had seen a tremendous increase in employment at the expense of employment in the informal sector. According to the THLFS, the percentage of 18- to 64-year-old men employed in the formal sector rose from 41.2% to 49.2% between 2004 and 2011, while that employed in the informal sector dropped from 29.7% to 24.2%.==== Moreover, for women, important trends were observed in labor force participation and employment in this period. The fraction of women in the labor force increased from 26.3% to 33.0% and the fraction of women employed rose from 23.3% to 29.2%.==== At the same time, significant regional differences exist in labor market outcomes in Turkey. Hence, not accounting for differential trends in the pre-shock period across regions could cause significant bias both in our OLS and IV frameworks—as shown by a number of recent papers in other settings (Jaeger et al., 2020; Goldsmith-Parkin et al., 2020; Christian and Barret; 2017). Therefore, we pay due attention to the potential pre-existing time trends across regions in our estimation and assess the plausibility of our instrument under various specifications for pre-existing trends.====We find that the migrant shock has a null effect on native men's total employment but a positive effect on their average wages. However, we also find suggestive evidence of a reduction in men's wage employment, which is compensated by the rise in their self-employment and unpaid family work. In the informal sector, men's total employment and wage employment fall substantially—particularly in construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Moreover, the substitutability between native and migrant workers in the informal sector decreases with rising levels of education and with age for natives. No evidence exists that regional migration flows of natives contribute to the fall in informal employment of native men. On the other hand, the migrant shock has a strong displacement effect on temporary wage workers, many of whom are ==== migrant workers from other regions—which is a significant phenomenon in Turkey, particularly in agriculture and construction.====In the formal sector, men's employment increases, neutralizing the drop in informal employment. This effect particularly stems from wage employment in the manufacturing sector and self-employment in the services sector. We also find a positive effect on men's wage employment and suggestive evidence of an increase in men's wages in the formal sector, which is consistent with an outward shift of the labor demand curve. We provide explanations for this rise in labor demand in the formal sector. General equilibrium effects and capital investment play an important role, in addition to the complementarity between informal Syrian workers and formal male native workers. We find evidence for a rise in prices in the product market, as migrants increase the consumption base more than the production base. An increase in capital investment in the treatment regions also takes place, as the productivity of capital in these regions increases with the massive labor supply shock.====For native women, although no adverse effects on average wages exist, we find suggestive evidence of a reduction in wage employment. Unlike for men, self-employment and unpaid family work do not make up for this reduction. Women's total employment also decreases among less-educated and older women. The migrant impact on women's part-time employment is particularly adverse. In terms of the sector of employment, the negative effects on women's employment are primarily driven by agriculture and services. Most women who lose their jobs leave the labor force, and we do not observe an increase in unemployment. In terms of total employment, the migrant impact is more adverse for women than men primarily because native women do not benefit from the migrant shock in terms of increased employment opportunities in the formal sector—unlike native men.====The mass migration of Syrians into Turkey has already drawn the attention of researchers on its impact on natives’ labor market outcomes (Ceritoğlu et al., 2017; del Carpio and Wagner, 2016). Before concluding our paper, we demonstrate with replications important methodological limitations of these papers and compare our findings with theirs—some of which are significantly different. Moreover, these studies do not allow for differential pre-existing time trends across regions in their estimation; however, we show that this creates a substantial bias for several key outcomes in this setting.==== In our paper, we use richer data; the number of refugees in 2015 is significantly higher than those in earlier years. Our paper is also more methodical in its analysis of labor market outcomes by formality status, gender, age, and education of natives so that we can understand the distributional effects of the migrant influx at a finer level.====We not only improve upon the data, methodology, and scope of the existing work but also introduce several novel elements. First, we uncover ==== that help explain our findings, including general equilibrium effects and capital investment. Second, our analysis by type and sector of employment of natives and our examination of wage and wage employment together so as to be able to interpret the findings in a labor market equilibrium framework are novel. Third, we have several key novel findings: (i) wages in the formal sector increase for men (particularly for non-college-educated, younger (below 40), and full-time workers); (ii) a transition occurs from wage employment to self-employment and unpaid family work for men; (iii) men's full-time employment rises at the expense of part-time employment, (iv) women's wage employment in the formal sector falls, especially for less-educated and older women—the groups for which the post-2008 employment subsidy program generated the most jobs, (v) temporary wage workers, many of whom are ==== migrant workers, are substantially displaced while no evidence exists for a change in outmigration of less-educated natives from the treatment regions; (vi) increases in consumer prices and net firm openings contribute to the rising demand for formal native workers.====In comparison to studies in other contexts of forced migration, while some of our findings are essentially similar, others are peculiar. The fact that the most vulnerable groups in the labor market—such as temporary wage workers, less-educated or young workers in the informal sector, and women who are part-time employed or self-employed—are adversely affected by the migrant shock is similar to the findings for Colombia (Bozzoli et al., 2013; Calderon-Mejia and Ibanez, 2016; Morales, 2017).==== However, while adverse wage effects on natives are more pronounced in the Colombian context, adverse employment effects dominate in the informal market in Turkey. We find that employment of natives in the formal sector expands, which is similar to the findings of Alix-Garcia and Bartlett (2015) and Ruiz and Vargas-Silva (2015) for Sudan and Tanzania, respectively. However, in our context, it is not only the better-off individuals who benefit in the formal sector; employment of less-educated natives also substantially expands in the formal sector. Another unique finding for the Turkish case is the strong positive employment and wage effects in the formal sector, especially for the manufacturing sector. At the same time, it is important to note that these are relatively short-term effects. As Morales (2017) finds in the Colombian setting, these effects might dissipate over time. Finally, as in several other studies in less-developed countries, we find a positive impact of refugees on consumer prices.==== This fact, coupled with the adverse labor market effects on the most vulnerable groups, implies that poverty might increase among these native groups.",The impact of mass migration of Syrians on the Turkish labor market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000744,21 May 2022,2022,Research Article,98.0

The main contributors are inter-temporal increases in working hours inequality and increases in the covariance between working hours and hourly wages, while changes in the distribution of hourly wages play a minor role. Applying a novel double decomposition technique reveals that these results are particularly pronounced in the growing groups of female employees and ==== employees. If employees had been able to realize their desired optimal working hours, the increase in inequality would have been more moderate. This is mainly due to the fact that employees with low hourly wages work less than desired, a finding that is reinforced over time—even after controlling for various covariates.","Earnings inequality has long been a central concern of economists and policy makers, and attention to the topic has increased with evidence of rising inequality in a number of countries (Piketty, 2015, OECD). Diverse factors appear to be playing a role in this development. With demographic and other societal changes affecting labor markets, people’s views and attitudes toward work are changing: The male breadwinner model is in decline, female labor market participation is rising (Von Gleichen and Seeleib-Kaiser, 2018), and work-life balance has taken on central importance, especially for ==== (Smith and Nichols, 2015). Researchers such as Biewen and Plötze (2019) and Henze (2014) have argued that changes in the composition of the working population—in particular the rising shares of female and service sector employees—are a driver of growing inequality. Others have argued that increasing inequality is related to the shift toward more flexibilization in labor markets, leading to a decline in union power (Fitzenberger et al., 2011) and to the growing prevalence of part-time work and atypical employment.====These developments have important implications for the work reality of employees. From a theoretical standpoint, in the neoclassical labor supply model, utility-maximizing individuals can freely choose their working hours. Accordingly, optimal labor supply equates the marginal disutility of labor to wages, as graphically defined by the tangency point of the indifference curve and the budget constraint. Yet labor market imperfections prevent employees from achieving their working time preferences and therefore imply utility losses. In particular, systematic differences between actually realized working hours and optimal working hours can result from the limited number of jobs available, from earnings limits on certain employment relationships, from job openings with non-negotiable working hours due to employers’ higher bargaining power, as well as from search costs and other market imperfections (Altonji, Paxson, 1992, Bloemen, 2008, Chetty, Friedman, Olsen, Pistaferri, 2011).====Shorter working hours directly reduce employees’ earnings in the present, but also result in lower human capital accumulation over time, flatter earnings profiles, and higher needs for government assistance in the future. For example, Biewen et al. (2018) and Paul (2016) show that part-time work negatively affects wages in the long term. Thus, the increase in part-time work also contributes dynamically to earnings inequality in the long term, beyond just the direct mechanical effect. Remedies discussed in the literature include compensation parity for part-time jobs, readjustments of unemployment insurance, employee empowerment (the right to request changes in hours), and a shift from an hourly to a monthly minimum wage (Golden, 2016).====Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the period 1993 to 2018, we study earnings inequality and its drivers—working hours, hourly wages, and the statistical association between the two—and compare these findings to a hypothetical counterfactual earnings distribution. This counterfactual earnings distribution is based on employees’ hourly wages and desired optimal working hours. We are not aware of any empirical studies that provide such a systematic exploration. This is understandable because in a world in which the assumptions of the neoclassical model do not hold, estimating the labor supply function is challenging. The estimation of the labor supply function based on the axiom of ==== relies on data on actual working hours and wages and involves identification assumptions regarding, among other things, the number of job offers and the working hours stipulated in them (Bloemen, 2008, Pencavel, 2016). Other identification issues concern the functional form of the labor supply function and the set of covariates considered. These identification issues motivate the interest in ==== in the form of self-reported desired working hours as an alternative data source.==== Precisely such self-reported desired hours—together with actual hourly wages—are used to construct the counterfactual distribution in the present paper.====We make three contributions to the literature: First, we describe the long-run trend in earnings inequalities in Germany by means of the mean log deviation (MLD). We employ a novel double decomposition technique based on a combination of the decomposition approaches established by Mookherjee and Shorrocks (1982) and Checchi et al. (2016) and the law of total covariance. This coherent framework allows us to decompose earnings inequality into inequalities in hourly wages, working hours and the association between the two, across four subgroups of the workforce: male and female employees in the service and non-service sector. These subgroups are important to study because of the changes that have occurred over recent years in the composition of the German work force, as detailed in Fig. 1. We also assess how inequalities would have changed in absence of the compositional changes by applying the reweighting procedure proposed in DiNardo et al. (1996). Second, we conduct analogous exercises for the counterfactual earnings distribution that builds on hourly wages and desired working hours. Comparing the distributions of actual earnings and counterfactual earnings sheds light on the role of working hours mismatch—the difference between desired and actual working hours—in earnings inequalities. Third, we run multivariate regressions to uncover drivers of the hours mismatch. To this end, the SOEP data contain a broad set of labor market variables as well as personal and household characteristics.====Germany is a particularly interesting context in which to investigate the connection between working hours mismatch and earnings inequality. We focus on developments in four key periods (see Fig. 1). First, after reunification, Germany experienced a phase of rising unemployment, particularly in the East (Snower and Merkl, 2006). Second, to fight persistently high unemployment, Germany introduced the Hartz labor market reforms==== between 2003 and 2005. In the years that followed, unemployment decreased markedly and the percentage of marginally employed people increased sharply (Fahr, Sunde, 2009, Jacobi, Kluve, 2007). Third, in contrast to many other countries, Germany showed a positive development in employment even within and after the Great Recession, which has been referred to as the “German labor market miracle” (Burda and Hunt, 2011). Fourth, a statutory minimum wage was introduced in 2015, which targeted between 10 and 14% of German employees and affected both wages and working hours==== (Caliendo et al., 2019). We structure our results around the four periods outlined above: ==== (1993–2002), ==== (2003–2007), ==== (2008–2014), ==== (2015–2018).====To preview our results, earnings inequality in terms of the MLD increases significantly from 0.19 to 0.29 during the ==== and ==== periods and plateaus at a high level thereafter. The MLD decomposition reveals that only 10% of the increase in earnings inequality result from rising wage inequalities, but that rising working hours inequalities and especially the increasing covariance between working hours and wages play the predominant role. Since the 2000s, in contrast to earlier years, low wages are more often connected to low working hours. This changing pattern turns out to be the main driver of rising earnings inequality in Germany. With regard to the changing composition of the work force, rising wage inequality among male service sector employees is the most important contributor to increased inequality in hourly wages. Increasing inequality in hours can be fully attributed to rising working hours inequality among male and female service sector employees. These two subgroups are also responsible for the increased covariance between hours and wages.====Turning to the counterfactual earnings distribution, we also find an increase in earnings inequality, which mostly occurs in the ==== and the ==== period. However, this increase is only about half the size of what is observed for the actual earnings distribution, with the MLD of counterfactual earnings increasing from 0.20 to 0.25. The MLD decomposition reveals that the attenuated increase in counterfactual earnings inequality is due to lower growth in the contributing factors of hours inequality and the covariance. The differences of inequalities in counterfactual and actual earnings are most pronounced—and rising—among female service sector employees. Here, inequality in counterfactual earnings and its three components remain constant over time. In other words, the inability to realize optimal working hours—particularly in the growing group of female service sector employees—contributes significantly to rising earnings inequality.====Our study also reveals changes in patterns of mismatch between desired and actual working hours. The share of overemployed people, those who work more hours than they would prefer, increases by seven percentage points among employees in the top quintile of hourly wages. At the same time, the share of underemployed people, those who prefer longer working hours, almost triples among employees in the bottom quintile. Additionally, we find increasing shares of underemployment among male and female employees in the service sector. These results also hold true after controlling for a broad set of control variables in multivariate regressions. Moreover, the regressions reveal that children are a major statistical explanation for underemployment among women, but not among men. This contradicts the notion that reduced working hours among mothers fully reflect their own choices and preferences.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the underlying database, its core variables and methods. Section 3 presents the results: the decomposition exercise of actual and counterfactual earnings inequality, and the investigation of working hours mismatch.

Our paper presents a model-based strategy to identify the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status, which is crucial to estimate the net economic gains from legalization. In the model, heterogeneous workers choose occupations and undocumented workers are subject to employer discrimination and experience productivity loss in occupations characterized by tasks that require legal status. The theoretical analysis provides guidance on how to identify occupational barriers and delivers an easy-to-compute lower bound for the undocumented productivity penalty. Applying this strategy to individual-level data that imputes undocumented status, we estimate that the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status in the United States is upward of 12% and affects roughly one third of undocumented workers, which in turn account for over 5% of US employment. Thus, legalization of undocumented workers would not only improve their wages, but also increase GDP by a minimum of 0.96% per year.","Many countries are home to large numbers of unauthorized immigrants.==== Despite lacking the right to reside or work legally, unauthorized immigrants contribute in significant ways to the economies of the host countries. Roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the United States, comprising 5% of the labor force and contributing over 3% of GDP (Edwards and Ortega, 2017). Legalization of undocumented workers is widely debated by policy-makers and social scientists. While questions of human rights and ethics are foundational to these debates, so are questions related to the economic effects of legalization for host countries.====A large body of literature shows that the wages and working conditions of undocumented immigrants increase when they gain legal status. In the context of the United States, many studies have supported this claim based on the 1986 IRCA legalization (Amuedo-Dorantes, Bansak, Raphael, 2007, Kossoudji, Cobb-Clark, 2002, Lozano, Sorensen, 2011, Pan, 2012, Rivera-Batiz, 1999) and, more recently, on the 2012 DACA program providing temporary work permits to undocumented youth (Amuedo-Dorantes, Antman, 2017, Pope, 2016).====However, the previous evidence is insufficient to answer some key concerns in the debate about the economic effects of legalization, such as the aggregate effects on GDP and on government coffers. Answering these questions requires distinguishing how much of the wage increase upon gaining legal status can be attributed to a gain in productivity versus other factors, such as the loss of employers’ ability to exploit undocumented workers. While the latter mainly entails income redistribution from employers to formerly undocumented workers, productivity increases generate a net increase in income (and tax revenue) for the host country. Quantifying the undocumented productivity penalty is crucial in structural analyses aimed at estimating the net economic contribution of undocumented workers and simulating the effects of legalization on GDP, the wage structure and government coffers (Edwards, Ortega, 2017, Machado, 2017, Ortega, Edwards, Hsin, 2019, Peri, Zaiour)).====Identifying the productivity gains associated with gaining legal status is a challenging task. While hard to quantify with precision, several studies have shown that unauthorized immigrants suffer wage exploitation (Bartolucci, 2014, Brown, Hotchkiss, Quispe-Agnoli, 2013, Gleeson, Gonzales, 2012). At the same time, there is clear evidence that (implicit) occupational barriers lead to occupational mismatch and diminish worker productivity (Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, Klenow, 2019, Weeden, 2002). The labor market opportunities of undocumented workers are almost certainly diminished by occupational barriers in similar ways (Abrego, 2011, Amuedo-Dorantes, Antman, 2017). These barriers vary importantly across occupations, reflecting regulatory constraints, such as legal residence requirements associated with licenses, as well as the nature of the specific tasks involved in each occupation. For instance, the need to hold face-to-face interactions with customers or government agencies, or to travel extensively, exposes undocumented workers to apprehension and deportation. Besides reducing the productivity of undocumented workers in these occupations, these entry barriers are likely to distort their occupational choices.====Our paper presents a new strategy to identify the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status. We lay out a theoretical model where heterogeneous workers choose occupations (as in the Roy model). Some occupations entail tasks that require legal status. As a result, undocumented workers in these occupations suffer a productivity loss that entails lower wages and acts as an entry barrier into those occupations and distorts their occupational choices. In addition, employers may exploit undocumented workers in all occupations, paying them wages below productivity. The theoretical analysis suggests an empirical strategy to identify which occupations have entry barriers for undocumented workers, clarifies the factors that determine the productivity and wage gaps between documented and undocumented workers, and shows how to estimate the undocumented productivity penalty. Additionally, the model also illustrates the labor market effects of legalization in terms of occupational switching, wage growth and net economic gains. An important lesson of our analysis is that exact identification of the undocumented productivity penalty is infeasible due to endogenous occupational sorting in terms of unobserved idiosyncratic productivity. However, even in this scenario, we derive a ==== for the productivity loss associated with lack of legal status.====The second part of the paper goes on to implement this strategy using a special extract of the ==== (ACS) that also includes a sophisticated imputation to identify likely undocumented individuals. Our empirical analysis has two main findings. First, we identify the occupations with the largest entry barriers to undocumented workers. Many of these occupations require legal status (e.g. teachers and nurses) or entail tasks that involve driving, long-distance travel or face-to-face interaction with the public and government officials (e.g. managers, secretaries or salespersons). These tasks cannot be accomplished in full by undocumented workers, reducing their productivity in these jobs and distorting their career choices. Secondly, we estimate that the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status is upwards of 12 percent and affects roughly one third of all undocumented workers. This finding implies that legalization would increase GDP and we quantify this increase to be ==== 0.96% per year.====Our analysis is not only relevant in the United States. Unauthorized immigration is pervasive in high-income countries that are in geographical proximity to countries with demographic, economic or political pressures (Orrenius and Zavodny, 2016). Several studies have used European data to analyze the economic effects of legalization. For instance, Monras et al. (2017) empirically analyze a large legalization process in Spain. Among other findings, they show that legal status increased the labor market opportunities of immigrants. Along similar lines, Devillanova et al. (2018) study the effect of the ==== of legal status on the employment of undocumented immigrants in Italy, finding a positive effect. Inevitably, an important factor in the discussions on whether to provide legal status to undocumented workers in receiving countries is the consequences of such a policy for GDP and the public coffers. As argued above, these effects rely crucially on whether legal status increases the productivity of undocumented workers or simply redistributes income from employers to employees.====The structure of the paper is the following. Section 2 summarizes the relevant literature. Section 3 presents our theoretical analysis. Section 4 presents the data and descriptive statistics.

Altogether, this indicates an increase in completed fertility. We present empirical evidence and cite prior literature demonstrating corresponding improvements in households’ economic outcomes, consistent with positive income effects on fertility in a developing economy.","We use the natural experiment of local resource booms and busts in Indonesia as an opportunity to study the response of family formation outcomes to economic conditions. Our analysis is motivated by several studies documenting the effects of resource booms on wage and employment growth (Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005, Jacobsen, Parker, 2016, Marchand, 2012, Michaels, 2010), and the long literature studying the relationship between income and wealth and the demand for children (Amialchuk, 2013, Bar, Leukhina, 2010, Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, Taylor, 2013, Clark, 2005, Galor, 2005, Heckman, Walker, 1990, Kearney, Wilson, 2018, Lindo, 2010).====In this paper, we estimate the effect of economic shocks, through oil booms and busts, on fertility decisions using Indonesian Census data from 1970 to 2008. Our analysis compares women’s fertility across regions experiencing a more or less severe boom or bust, depending on the local economy’s oil intensity. Our identification strategy exploits the interaction between exogenous time series variation in global oil prices and regional variation in resource abundance. For the same change in the world price of oil, regions with more oil experience larger shocks than regions with less oil. Our proxy for resource abundance is the size of preexisting oil endowment in a regency. We argue that economic shocks are independent of unobserved factors correlated with the fertility decision because oil endowments depend on geology and the oil price is set on the world market and exogenous to individuals’ fertility decisions.====We find that an increase in oil endowment value per capita increases the probability of having a child in a developing country. The increase in fertility is driven by women of all ages and by both first and higher parity births. We find no evidence that oil endowment value per capita affects birth spacing. Taken together, these results suggest the overall increase in fertility is not only driven by women having desired children sooner, but also reflects an increase in completed fertility.====We also explore several mechanisms through which oil shocks may affect fertility. We use supplemental data from Indonesia’s labor force surveys, socioeconomic household surveys, and village census to estimate effects of oil endowment value per capita on labor market outcomes, government expenditures, and proxies for healthcare access. We find evidence that oil shocks have a positive effect on households’ economic outcomes, indicating that a positive income effect is an important mechanism.====Prior work has found both positive and negative relationships between measures of economic prosperity and fertility, and is mainly from industrialized countries. Several papers have documented the link between higher incomes and significant declines in fertility using time-series data (the “Fertility Transition” or “Demographic Transition”) and a general finding using cross-country data is a clear negative relationship between income and fertility.==== More recent work identifies causal effects using exogenous shocks to households’ economic prospects and finds positive income effects on fertility.====We contribute to the existing literature by demonstrating positive natural resource shocks lead to increased fertility in a developing country and by providing additional evidence consistent with positive income effects and children being normal goods. Our results are explained mostly by an increase in total fertility, with no changes in birth spacing. Our findings in the context of a country undergoing a demographic transition are interesting in light of documented declining fertility rates during such transitions in other countries, as well as the negative cross-country income-fertility relationship. Indeed, Indonesia provides a very different context from existing work examining the United States. The United States is considerably wealthier, local economies in Indonesia depend to a larger extent on natural resources, and in Indonesia, government programs exist to limit fertility while in the United States (and other developed countries), policymakers are instead considering the long-run negative implications of low fertility rates.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on oil production and fertility in Indonesia. Section 3 details the data and Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents our main results.

We conclude that full-time retirees do not return to work despite losing a meaningful share of their annual income. Specifically, we can rule out response elasticities larger than 0.051. This precisely estimated null effect also extends to retirees who have limited savings, who face little demand-side obstacles to reentering the labor force, and to younger individuals who just recently entered retirement. The paper further shows that the negative income shock had no impact on the health of ==== as measured by their utilization of the health care system. The lack of an employment and health care utilization response suggests that a reduction in benefit levels may have little impact on individuals in our context. At the height of an ongoing global crisis in which public pension funds are rapidly losing value, these results are particularly important.","Population aging threatens the financial stability of existing public pension schemes. In response, governments across the globe have pursued extensive retirement reforms.==== Most of these reforms revolve around incentivizing workers to postpone retirement and encouraging pensioners to return to work (OECD 2015). However, while there is a rich literature examining the impact of financial incentives on workers’ decision to ==== (e.g., Laun 2017; Malkova 2020; Haller 2021), there is no evidence on the effect of financial incentives on pensioners’ decision to unretire and ====In light of increasing efforts to activate the older population, understanding how full-time retirees respond to financial incentives is important. Between 2016 and 2050, the percent of the world's population aged 65 and over is expected to increase from 9 percent to 17 percent (NIH 2016). Thus, without effective policies that extend the working lives of the population, and encourage retirees to reenter the workforce, the public finance effects will be substantial. However, a lack of exogenous variation in pension income among full-time retirees has prevented previous literature from examining the relationship between income and pensioners’ decision to unretire.====In this paper, we overcome this obstacle by exploiting a feature of the Swedish pension system that caused differential and unexpected benefit cuts among otherwise identical pensioners in a regression discontinuity design. This allows us to provide the first estimates in the literature on the labor supply response to income shocks among full-time retirees. Understanding the labor supply behavior of fully-retired individuals is of independent interest and provides important insights on labor supply decisions across the lifecycle. In addition, it provides vital guidance to policymakers tasked with adapting current pension systems in face of ongoing demographic changes.====The feature of the pension system that we exploit is known as the automatic balancing mechanism (ABM). The ABM automatically ensures the solvency of the public pension system by tying pension payouts to the ratio of assets to liabilities in the system. When this ratio drops below one, pension benefits are cut to eliminate the deficit. When the ratio recovers and exceeds one, a period of catch-up occurs with higher rates of indexation and accumulation. The catch-up period ends when the pension benefits are equal to what they would have been absent ABM activation. Thus, the income lost due to the ABM is never recovered. First introduced by Sweden in 2001, a number of countries across the globe – including Canada, Germany, and Japan – have introduced elements of this mechanism into their pension systems. As this feature is becoming increasingly integrated into pension systems around the world, understanding its effect on pensioners is crucial.====The Swedish pension system fell out of balance for the first time in 2010. Consequently, the ABM activated and cut pension benefits. The ABM remained in effect until 2018, and between 2010 and 2018 almost $7.8 billion was lost in pension benefits.==== This is equivalent to the total public expenditure on health care and social welfare by the national government in any given year (2018/19:SoU1 2018). The largest loss occurred in 2011, in which already retired individuals lost between 0 and 7 percent of their total annual pension benefits. This loss is equivalent to more than 9 months of the average pensioner's total food consumption in that year (MinPension 2020). Importantly, this is a sizable benefit change compared to other international pension benefit reforms,==== and therefore represents an ideal setting for studying the labor supply response of retirees to income shocks.====By lowering pension benefits, the ABM unintentionally incentivizes pension-eligible workers to remain in the labor force, and retired pensioners to return to work. We use rich population-wide administrative data to examine how this shock affected the labor market behavior of individuals who had left the labor force and entered full-time retirement prior to the activation of the ABM. While institutional restrictions prevent us from studying the impact of the shock on older workers’ decision to delay retirement, questions related to delaying retirement have been studied at length elsewhere (e.g. Jensen and Richter 2004; Coile and Gruber 2007; Behaghel and Blau 2012; Laun 2017).==== The causal effect of adverse income shocks on individuals’ decision to unretire, however, has to the best of our knowledge never been examined before. Importantly, retirement is not an absorbing state— between 6 and 14 percent of retirees reverse their retirement decision after having exited the labor force in Sweden (Pettersson 2014), and more than 26 percent of retirees do the same in the US (Maestas 2010). Pettersson (2014) also shows that higher pension benefits are negatively correlated with unretirement. This implies a potentially important role for financial incentives in altering the unretirement behavior of individuals, and understanding the causal link between unretirement and financial incentives is therefore of great independent value.====We use a regression discontinuity design, leveraging the fact that the magnitude of the shock changes discontinuously at pre-specified thresholds in the pension scheme. Specifically, pensioners who received almost identical public pensions prior to ABM activation were exposed to substantially different shocks depending on which side of a specific benefit level threshold they were located, with income losses ranging from 0 percent to 7 percent of their annual pension benefits. We exploit these discontinuities (each corresponding to a loss of approximately 3.5 percent of their annual pension benefits) to examine the impact of negative income shocks on the labor market outcomes of pensioners who had left the labor force and entered full-time retirement prior to the ABM. We also conduct a detailed analysis on the effect of the income shock on the health of the affected individuals, proxied by their utilization of the health care system. This is motivated in part by existing evidence on a positive relationship between income and health, and in part by the idea that any potential unretirement behavior among retirees may translate into worsened health. To correctly identify the value of the running variable required for our RD design, the baseline analysis is restricted to single households with no private pension insurance. In Section 6, we show that including individuals with private pension insurance, or restricting the sample to married individuals, has no impact on the results.====The main contribution of our paper is to provide novel evidence on the labor supply of already retired individuals. This is a difficult question to address empirically, because the political cost of cutting benefits for already retired individuals is extremely high. There is therefore very little plausibly exogenous variation in benefit cuts among the retired population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature to examine the labor supply of already retired individuals, and the first paper to provide an estimate of the income elasticity of the retired population. However, there are several relevant strands of literature that have explored the impact of financial and other retirement incentives among older (non-retired) workers.====First, there is a rich and growing literature examining the effects of the Earnings Test for Social Security (AET) in the US, which reduces the Social Security benefits of individuals if they earn above a certain amount and decide to retire prior to the normal retirement age. Prior studies on the AET have found moderate substitution elasticities on the intensive margin (e.g. Friedberg, 1998; Friedberg, 2000; Song and Manchester, 2007; Gelber et al., 2020a; Engelhardt and Kumar 2009; Engelhardt and Kumar 2014), and more recent work has identified effects on the extensive margin as well (e.g. Gelber et al., 2020b). However, the AET provides a marginal incentive (a change in the net-of-tax rate, i.e. the marginal gain from additional earnings), and has no income effect for full-time retired individuals. This policy can therefore not be used to examine the labor supply of already retired individuals. In contrast, the Swedish ABM creates a pure income effect for full-time retired individuals, providing us with an ideal setting for exploring the relationship between income and unretirement.====More broadly, the paper contributes to the literature on financial incentives and retirement behavior (e.g., Jensen and Richter 2004; Snyder and Evans 2006; Coile and Gruber 2007; Behaghel and Blau 2012; Chetty et al., 2013; Brown 2013; Johansson et al., 2016; Manoli and Weber 2016; Laun 2017; Malkova 2020; Seibold 2021; Haller 2021). These papers exploit exogenous variation in tax rates and pension benefits to study the interaction between the labor supply of older workers and their financial situation. A number of these studies have found significant labor market effects induced by incentives that are of a very similar magnitude to those studied in this paper. For example, Snyder and Evans (2006) exploits a social security notch that generated a four percent change in annual income – similar to the difference between any two of our groups – and find statistically significant and economically meaningful labor market effects.==== However, recent papers in this literature also suggest that responses to purely financial incentives may have more modest effects, especially compared to the influence of reference ages (Behaghel-Blau 2012; Manoli-Weber 2016, 2018; Seibold 2021). Responses may therefore be smaller, or even zero, for already-retired individuals. The distinct contribution of our paper is to examine how pensioners that have exited the labor force respond to negative income shocks, something that cannot be identified in these papers.====Finally, the paper contributes to the literature on unearned income effects in labor supply more generally, where evidence is limited and based on specific contexts, such as winning a lottery (e.g., Imbens et al. 2001; Lindahl 2005; Cesarini et al. 2017). This literature finds modest reductions in labor supply as a result of increased unearned income. However, none of these have been able to isolate the effects of income shocks on existing retirees. Studying full-time retirees is of great independent interest, not only because their behavior likely differs from working individuals for many reasons, but also because it represents a particularly vulnerable group that cannot adjust their labor market behavior on the intensive margin.====We provide two sets of key results. First, we estimate precise null effects of the income shock on the labor market outcomes of full-time retirees, and conclude that pensioners in retirement do not return to work despite losing a meaningful share of their annual income. Specifically, we can rule out response elasticities larger than 0.051 at the 95 percent confidence level. Importantly, this precisely estimated null effect extends to retirees who have limited savings (proxied by wealth and lack of private pension savings), who face little demand-side obstacles to reentering the labor force (proxied by the local unemployment rate), who recently entered full-time retirement, and to the youngest age cohorts in our sample. The lack of an employment response is an interesting result given existing studies which have used considerably smaller-sized income shocks to identify meaningful labor supply responses among workers. For example, Haller (2021) studies pension reforms in Austria that generated a 1.25 percent reduction in future benefits, and finds that this 1.25 percent change in benefits leads to an increase in employment at age 60 of around 10 percent. Mullen and Staubli (2016) examines a series of disability insurance reforms in Austria, some of which led to no more than a 1 percent change in disability insurance benefits, and finds significant increases in disability insurance claiming. Snyder and Evans (2006) find that a four percent change in annual income caused individuals to delay retirement.==== These papers illustrate that financial incentives of smaller or similar magnitudes to those examined in the current paper have been shown to alter the labor market behavior of individuals in meaningful ways. While we acknowledge that the above studies have focused on individuals of working age rather than on retirees, we believe that it is of great independent value to understand whether individuals who have left the labor force and entered retirement are equally responsive to such shocks. Specifically, it helps us better understand the relationship between financial incentives and unretirement, and how large financial shocks may have to be in order to induce extensive margin response among retirees.====Our second key result is that the negative income shock has no effect on the health of retirees, as measured by health care utilization. While this is consistent with papers documenting a lack of health effects associated with income changes among older individuals (e.g. Adams et al., 2003; Lindahl 2005; Michaud and van Soest 2008), we are the first to show that this also holds for retired pensioners – a group of individuals who cannot respond to income shocks along the intensive margin of labor supply.====In terms of contextualizing our findings, Sweden is located in the middle of the OECD ranking in terms of public pension generosity, slightly above the US and Canada but far below countries such as Austria and Portugal (OECD 2017). Thus, while one may expect any potential effects to be larger in settings where the baseline pension is lower, and smaller in settings where the baseline pension is higher, the Swedish setting is likely informative of similar-sized cuts in a large number of OECD countries.====The results from our analysis have important policy implications. Specifically, the almost perfectly inelastic labor supply response to income shocks demonstrates that policies that alter the income of pensioners in retirement will likely not induce them to return to work; at least not at the margin relevant to policymakers and social planners. Specifically, provided that the income shock is large enough, it will eventually force individuals to unretire. However, in terms of international comparisons, a 3.5 percent drop in pension benefits is relatively substantial. For example, Norway raised the minimum pension with $400 a year in 2020, Sweden raised public pensions with $40 per month in 2021, New York raised the contribution requirement with 3 percent following the financial crisis in 2008, and Austria has engaged in several pension reforms over the past 30 years, some of which shifted the average pension income of individuals by less than 3 percent.==== Thus, changes to the benefit levels of existing public pension systems are oftentimes of a magnitude similar to that studied in the current paper, and studying the labor supply response to this shock is therefore of particular interest. However, we also acknowledge that retirees will respond to an income shock provided that the income shock is large enough. An interesting avenue for future research is therefore to understand how big the benefit change must be for inducing individuals to unretire, and we encourage future research on this topic.====In addition to the policy implications associated with the null result on labor market behavior, the lack of health care utilization effects suggest that the externalities associated with the ABM approach of ensuring macro-level fiscal sustainability of the pension system may be small. That is, the lack of an employment and health utilization response suggest that a reduction in benefit levels may have little impact on individuals in our context while at the same time ensuring financial sustainability of the system. At the height of a global crisis where pension funds are rapidly losing value, these results may be particularly important.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we provide detailed information on the Swedish pension system and the automatic balancing mechanism; In Section 3, we introduce the data, discuss our estimation strategy, and examine our identifying assumptions; In Section 4, we provide our main results on benefit cuts, labor market outcomes, and health utilization; In Section 5, we discuss heterogeneous treatment effects across genders, age, wealth, and prior labor force attachment; In Section 6 we explore the robustness of our results; Section 7 concludes.",The effect of negative income shocks on pensioners,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000665,8 May 2022,2022,Research Article,102.0

Using state- and nativity-level variation in reforms, I show that granting driving privileges to the undocumented increases vehicle ownership and the probability of car commute by 3 percentage points. This improvement in accessibility leads to a 1 percentage point increase in the employment rate. The employment effects are larger in low-accessibility localities, which are more rural and entail longer commuting times. Undocumented immigrants exhibit stronger positive employment effects in more vehicle-dependent occupations. These findings highlight the quantitative importance of transportation barriers in determining the labor market outcomes of minority workers.","Labor market efficiency depends critically on effectively matching workers with firms. As cities have been decentralized and specialization has increased, ==== has been hypothesized as a potential barrier preventing workers from finding employment at firms and in occupations that best fit their abilities. As first highlighted by Kain (1968),==== spatial mismatch occurs when workers are spatially disconnected from jobs as a result of limited residential mobility or a scarcity of local jobs. A stream of the spatial mismatch literature specifically emphasizes the lack of transportation resources such as private vehicles (i.e., transportation mismatch) as an important cause of disconnection between workers and jobs. Although spatial or transportation mismatch can play an important and growing role in the labor market, evidence for its empirical effects on labor market outcomes and the effectiveness of policies designed to address it remains scant. Previous studies often lack exogenous variation of job accessibility, which is subject to the problem of reverse causality between accessibility and labor market outcomes.====In this paper I analyze the causal effects of improved job accessibility using recent policy reforms: granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants. Prior to the reforms, many undocumented immigrants were unable to drive legally because of restrictions on driver’s licenses, which exacerbated the spatial mismatch they experienced. Beginning especially in 2013, a wave of state-level reforms removed legal barriers to obtaining licenses, granting undocumented immigrants significantly greater mobility and independence. To explicate these ideas, I first present a simple search-and-matching model that illustrates the employment effects of reduced commuting costs resulting from license reforms. Then, using the policy variation in event-study, difference-in-differences, and triple difference models, I identify the impacts of the license reforms on vehicle ownership and commuting patterns. I then examine the consequences for employment outcomes and two underlying mechanisms behind the employment effects, which are spatial frictions and the level of vehicle-dependency associated with a given occupation.====The analysis in this paper depends crucially on identifying undocumented immigrants from survey data, which does not usually reflect such sensitive information. To do so, I use an imputation method to identify undocumented immigrants in survey data, originated by Warren and Passel (1987) and developed by Borjas (2017). I first identify documented immigrants among the foreign born in the datasets using characteristics such as citizenship status or year of US entry. The residual group of all the other foreign born individuals is then classified as potentially undocumented immigrants.====I find that driver’s license reforms resulted in economically meaningfully improvements in labor market outcomes for undocumented workers. I first show significant increases in vehicle ownership and the probability of car commute for undocumented immigrants. The vehicle ownership rate and probability of commuting by car increase by 2 to 3 percentage points. This result confirms that the license reforms had large first-order policy effects on undocumented immigrants, improving their accessibility through increases in vehicle ownership. I then show that granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants increases their employment rate by 1 percentage point.====There are two main mechanisms underlying the commuting and employment effects of issuing driver’s licenses to the undocumented: spatial frictions and the level of vehicle-dependency associated with a given occupation. First, the effects of license reforms are examined by reference to area-level accessibility for undocumented immigrants, which is measured by the difference in the mean transit time between undocumented and documented immigrants. I find that the positive impacts of license reforms are large in localities where undocumented immigrants suffer from poorer accessibility with longer transit times than documented workers experience. These localities tend to be rural areas and smaller cities, where jobs are scarce and public transportation is limited.====Second, the effects of license reforms are broken down according to the extent to which each occupation requires workers to drive vehicles. The measure of occupation-related vehicle-dependency, which shows how important driving vehicles is to job performance, is obtained using O*NET tasks and activities data. For undocumented immigrants, the positive employment effects are concentrated in more vehicle-dependent occupations, such as agriculture workers, manufacturing workers, construction laborers, plumbers, or sales workers. These occupations tend to be more male-dominated, resulting in larger employment effects on males than females, and higher paying for undocumented immigrants. In contrast, I find negative employment effects in low vehicle-dependent occupations, such as maids and housekeeping cleaners. This implies that undocumented workers shifts from low vehicle-dependent to high vehicle-dependent occupations as a result of license reforms====This paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature. First, it adds to the spatial mismatch literature using a novel policy variation that can directly improve employment accessibility for minorities. There is a voluminous body of literature on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, such as Brueckner and Zenou (2003), Hellerstein et al. (2008), Andersson et al. (2018).==== Also, Ong (2002), Raphael and Rice (2002), Cervero et al. (2002), Gurley and Bruce (2005), Baum (2009) focus specifically on “transportation mismatch,” analyzing the relationship between vehicle ownership and labor market outcomes.==== An empirical challenge to identifying a causal effect of spatial or transportation mismatch on employment outcomes has emerged, however, because of reverse causality or omitted variable bias (Glaeser, 1996). Unlike previous papers, many of which use primarily instrumental variables to address these problems, I analyze an exogenous policy reform that can directly improve job accessibility. Moreover, I show empirically that the effects of issuing driver’s licenses is stronger in places characterized by lower accessibility, connecting the traditional spatial mismatch literature with the transportation mismatch literature that emphasizes the role of private vehicles. Furthermore, I examine shifts in occupational choice induced by improved job accessibility, which has not been fully explored in prior works on spatial (or transportation) mismatch.====The second contribution involves analyzing the policy effects of granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants. In particular, I show the large impacts of license reforms on vehicle ownership and means of commuting in this population. Other works have examined the effects of driver’s license policy targeting undocumented immigrants. Cáceres and Jameson (2015) study how restricting undocumented immigrants from obtaining driver’s licenses in the earlier periods affected insurance premiums. Lueders et al. (2017) focus on the impact of license reform on accidents in California.====In a recent paper that was released while this paper was in progress, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) also examine the effects of license reforms on labor market outcomes for likely undocumented immigrants using the same dataset. My paper differs substantially from that study, however, in the following ways. First, I find first-order policy effects on vehicle ownership and car commuting, which is an important link between license reforms and labor market outcomes. Also, I establish the labor market findings more rigorously, especially significant employment effects that are not shown in the other paper, with a number of robustness and heterogeneity analyses.==== In addition, I identify the spatial and occupation mechanisms behind the positive employment effects on undocumented immigrants, which provides a more complete picture of the effects of license reforms. Moreover, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) restrict the sample to low-skilled non-citizen Hispanics, while I do not impose such a restriction, showing the effects on the general undocumented population using the methodology recently introduced by Borjas (2017).====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I provide a conceptual framework for the effects of license reforms. In Section 3, I sketch the timeline of license reforms. In Section 4, I describe the data and introduce descriptive statistics. In Section 5, I outline empirical strategies used in the analysis. In Section 6, I discuss the effects of license reforms on vehicle ownership. In Section 7, I analyze how license reforms affect commuting and employment outcomes. Sections 8 and 9 focus on the two mechanisms underlying the license reforms: spatial and occupation mechanisms.

This randomization enables us to shed light on learning in races, and explore debut-racers’ performance as they gain experience. Key findings are; (1) Women are initially less skilled than men, (2) average debut-woman's performance improves faster than debut-men's, (3) after gaining racing experience, the gender gap in skill and performance disappears.","Tournaments are institutions shaping individuals’ behavior. Typically, they elicit greater effort and higher performance across many different situations, ranging from sports to the workplace. However, studies have established that competitors’ performance in tournaments varies with gender.==== Moreover, women seem to perform worse when they compete against men (Gneezy et al., 2003; Backus et al., 2016; Booth et al., 2018; Booth and Yamamura, 2018; Dolder et al., 2020), or when they compete against men in male-oriented tasks (Günther et al., 2010). These studies find that females’ competitive performance in tournaments is lower in mixed-sex environments than in single-sex, findings that are of considerable general interest.==== If competitors’ gender matters, placing females too early in mixed-sex competitions may have wider performance implications. For example, if a workforce becomes more male-dominated at higher levels, women's lower willingness to compete against men might contribute to explaining gender differences in remuneration, and policies might be devised to mitigate this.====Our objective in the present paper is to examine how tournament performance ==== responds to the gender composition of the group with whom a participant is competing. Does women's behavior evolve with experience as they adjust to competing against men? What are their performance patterns like from the time they make their debut? How does this compare to male behavior? In this paper we provide answers to these questions using unique field data from a single occupation. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the impact of the sex-composition of the competing group on individuals' tournament-outcomes from debut onwards.====Experimental economists can randomly assign subjects into treatments – single-sex or mixed-sex groups – and hence eliminate worries about selection. However, it is rare to find studies using field data that randomly allocate individuals into single-sex and mixed-sex environments each time they participate. Booth and Yamamura (2018) – henceforth B-Y (2018) – used field data from the japanese speedboat racing association (JSRA) to see how male and female performance varies in mixed-sex and single-sex environments. Their data cover 7 of the 24 stadiums over the period 2014 to 2015. For each race, the JSRA randomly assigns racers into two treatment groups: single-sex and mixed-sex, and racers are not permitted to refuse an allocation. Thus, selection is not an issue when investigating the impact of single-sex or mixed-sex groups on performance. B-Y (2018) found that women's race time is slower in mixed-sex than all-women races, whereas men's race time is faster in mixed-sex than men-only races. Further, in mixed-sex races, men are more likely to display their skill at lane-changing than are women.====Owing to data availability, B-Y (2018) did not examine how gender differences evolve over the course of multiple interactions, nor look at agents’ performance from debut. Yet this is potentially important, for tournaments are frequently designed to encourage individuals to provide effort in a dynamic context. From the time they first enter a particular tournament, individuals learn how to adjust their strategies depending on their relative place in the competition, and on the gender mix of the tournament.====Since B-Y (2018), we gained access to additional data allowing us to explore dynamic issues. In the present paper, we investigate the evolution of gender differences in performance in single-sex and mixed-sex environments using JSRA data from all 24 stadiums and following racers from their debut into this occupation.==== Our estimating sample comprises over one million person-race observations of all men and women who made their racing debut in the observation window 1997 to 2011. The randomization enables us to establish some basic stylized facts about male and female debut racers as they gain experience, and to shed light on learning in single-sex and mixed-sex environments. We explore skill differences between male and female racers at an initial point of time, and then analyze the subsequent process of skills formation by comparing women with men in this novel setting. The research questions of this study are whether men and women differ in their returns to experience in competitive environments, and whether (gender-specific) returns differ depending on whether the competitive environment is mixed- or single-sex.====Our main result is that – while everyone improves their racing skills and techniques (proxied by lane-changing in the initial period of turnaround) and performance with experience – men are more competent in single-sex and mixed-sex races than women. However, women's returns to experience are higher than men's in single-sex races and lower in mixed-sex races.==== This implies that the learning effect from experience on skills and performance varies according to competitive environments.====Our paper is set out as follows. Section II outlines the institutional background of the JSRA. Section III provides an overview of the data. Section IV explains the estimation approach, while Sections V and VI present the estimation results for two performance measures – lane-changing and place-in-race.

To evaluate this trade-off, I leverage a quasi-experimental setting in which Illinois required compliance training for new and existing real estate agents. Analyzing multiple data sources (licensee registration, aggregate housing statistics, and a national household survey), I find that the reform caused a one-time spike in agent outflows and a decrease in home sales, with female and novice agents being less likely to stay. For the policy intention, I do not find strong evidence that the reform reduced new misconduct incidents.","Occupational licensing covers one-fourth of the US workforce, more than are affected by minimum wage legislation or unionization (Kleiner, 2006). This growing regulation imposes an entry barrier that reduces jobs, limits consumer access to service, and raises prices (Friedman, 1962). By contrast, proponents of licensing argue that minimum worker standards protect consumers against incompetent workers (Leland, 1979). Measuring both the supply and quality effect at the same time provides practical information for policymakers about whether a license policy is welfare-improving.====In this study, I examine the licensing effect on workers and consumers by leveraging an Illinois reform on real estate licenses in 2011. The Illinois legislation offers unique features that facilitate an evaluation of the quantity-quality tradeoff of licensing. Under the new policy, both new and existing practitioners had to obtain more training. Existing agents had a one-year grace period to meet the new requirement, or their licenses expired. With the possible departure of existing agents and more training for all agents, the legislation should have immediate quantity and quality impacts on the economy.==== Because the policy aimed to protect home sellers and buyers from agent misbehavior, misconduct incidents offer an appropriate measure to assess policy effectiveness.==== Lastly, compared to previous licensing studies in specific industries, the real estate sector has far bigger economic impacts that affect a broad array of workers and consumers.====My empirical analysis primarily exploits the state administrative records of real estate licensees. Compared to national surveys, which are common data sources in the licensing literature, the official information on individual licensure dates accurately measures the stock, inflow, and outflow of real estate agents.==== Because the policy intention is to combat misconduct, I supplement the main licensure data with disciplinary cases of real estate agents which are official records of misconduct. Although the number of disciplinary cases is an intuitive quality measure, they were rarely analyzed in the licensing literature because manual transcription of legal documents is onerous. To estimate a causal effect of the policy, I primarily employ the synthetic control method (SCM) to address policy endogeneity (Abadie, Diamond, Hainmueller, 2010, Abadie, Gardeazabal, 2003).==== The essence of this approach is to compare Illinois with a more reliable control group that could mirror counterfactual Illinois based on more balanced characteristics, including the pre-treatment outcome and demographic/housing covariates.====I find that the increased training requirement reduced real estate licensees by about 20% primarily due to a spike of non-renewals in the first policy year. In absolute terms, there was a loss of about 20,000 registered agents. Exploiting also the licensee characteristics in the records, I find that female and novice agents are more likely not to renew the license after the policy. In theory, the licensee record captures the policy effect on potential agent supply. In practice, it may not reflect the actual employment status. Cross-checking the employment information in a national household survey (the American Community Survey), I also find a significant decrease in real estate employment and a stronger impact for females. Overall, the increased training requirement reduced both agent availability and actual employment in the real estate sector in Illinois. The policy also created a harder environment for female and novice agents.====By contrast, the effect on misbehavior is less conclusive. There was a drop in new misconduct cases for some years, but the effect size is not precisely estimated. At best, my analysis does not find strong evidence of fewer cases in a statistical sense. To enrich the analysis about the potential impacts on real estate consumers, I also analyze the county housing statistics pooled from a third-party private company.==== There was a significant reduction in home sales on average, implying that the decreased agent availability had an immediate consequence on consumers.====This paper extends the analysis of occupational licensing in two important ways. First, measuring the license status of a worker has been a huge obstacle in the licensing literature.==== Gittleman et al. (2018) documented significant measurement errors from the self-reported license status in household surveys, which are the major data sources for previous licensing studies. In this paper, the official licensee record allows me to accurately capture potential supply in a sector of significant influence for economic output. The similar results by both the licensee record and the national survey also give credence to the use of household surveys (despite possible measurement errors) in future licensing studies. Second, the worker flow is a valuable but under-studied aspect in the licensing literature.==== The unique policy context and the richness of the administrative data allow me to identify the source of supply reduction (i.e. a prompt agent outflow) and what worker characteristics are more vulnerable in response to a licensing shock.====This paper also provides crucial updates to the knowledge about real estate licenses. Carroll and Gaston (1979) are among the first to assess the licensing impact in the real estate market. They find that more restrictive licensing (measured by exam pass rate) is associated with a longer duration of vacancy of a property. Later studies making use of state differences in real estate licensing requirements tend to find that more restrictive licensing regimes are associated with fewer practitioners, and no or slight improvements on quality standard (Ingram and Yelowitz, 2021, Johnson, Loucks, 1986, Shilling, Sirmam, 1988). Leveraging a contemptuous policy change and a unique licensee dataset, this paper offers a sharper identification of both the supply-side and quality effect of licensing in the real estate business.",The costs and potential benefits of occupational licensing: A case of real estate license reform,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712200063X,18 April 2022,2022,Research Article,106.0

Previous research has found no change in mobility at the national level during this time period, but we show that this hides substantial increases and decreases in mobility at the local level. For children from low-income families, there is convergence in mobility over time, and average differences by region become much smaller. For children from high-income families, the geographic variation in mobility becomes much larger. Our results suggest caution in treating mobility as a fixed characteristic of a place.","Intergenerational mobility is widely studied and often treated as a marker of a society's level of fairness or opportunity. Recently, with access to the universe of tax records for certain birth cohorts and the ability to link parents and children based on dependent claiming, researchers have been able to study mobility in the U.S. at much finer levels — both geographically and temporally — than was previously possible. Chetty et al. (2014a) focus on mobility for children whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the national parent income distribution. Using estimates at the level of commuting zones (CZs, which are clusters of counties) for children born 1980–82, they find large geographic variation in mobility, both across and within regions. Chetty et al. (2014b) address the question of changes in mobility over time at the national level, and find that upward mobility was close to constant for children born 1971–1993.====We revisit these questions of spatial and temporal variation in intergenerational mobility by examining changes in mobility at the CZ level across birth cohorts, using statistics released by the Opportunity Insights project on mobility for the 1980–86 birth cohorts. We find that while mobility from the 25th percentile did not change on average nationally across these birth cohorts, there were large increases and decreases at the local level. We show a map of these changes in mobility in Fig. 1, revealing more positive changes in Texas, most of the Southeast, and some of the Midwest, and more negative changes in the West and in Florida.====Our findings suggest that some of the results in Chetty et al. (2014a) are particular to the birth cohorts they study, and that the geographic patterns of mobility can change substantially, even over a relatively short span of time. There is convergence in mobility from the 25th percentile between the 1980 and 1986 birth cohorts, such that places with lower initial mobility tend to experience a more positive subsequent change. Regional differences in mobility become much smaller over this time period: differences in average mobility across the four census regions can explain 25 percent of the overall variation in mobility in the 1980 cohort, but only 5 percent in the 1986 cohort. An example of this phenomenon is that Chetty et al. (2014a) find that mobility is lowest in the Southeast, but this region experiences generally positive changes in mobility between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts, as shown in our map in Fig. 1. Chetty et al. (2014a) also find that, on average, mobility from the 25th percentile is lower in urban areas than in rural areas. We find that this gap increased somewhat between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts, from 2.6 to 3.3 percentiles.====If mobility from the 25th percentile improves over time in a CZ, this could reflect a general increase in incomes (relative to the national distribution) for all children who grew up in that CZ, or the improvement could be confined to children in the CZ who grew up in low-income households. To address this question, we repeat our analysis using mobility from the 75th percentile. We find evidence of significant divergence in mobility from the 75th percentile between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts. The cross-sectional standard deviation of mobility increases by 45 percent over this time period, regional gaps increase, and urban areas fall further behind rural areas on average.====Therefore, while Chetty et al. (2014a), studying the 1980–82 cohort, find substantial geographic variation in mobility from the 25th percentile, and less variation in mobility from the 75th percentile, we find that in the 1986 cohort, the situation is very different: because of convergence in mobility from the 25th percentile and divergence in mobility from the 75th percentile, in the 1986 cohort there is more geographic variation in mobility from the 75th percentile. We show that, in a mechanical sense, this can be attributed to a change in the correlation between the height (at the median of the parents’ income distribution) of the rank-rank relationship between children's income and parents’ income and the slope of that relationship. The correlation was significantly negative in the 1980 cohort, so that places with higher rank-rank relationships had flatter slopes. However, in the 1986 cohort, the correlation was slightly positive.====Our work complements a growing literature that uses the statistics produced by Opportunity Insights to study geographic variation in mobility. Krause and Reeves (2017), Weber et al. (2017), and Weber et al. (2018) further explore the urban-rural differences in mobility noted by Chetty et al. (2014a). Other local characteristics that have been linked to income mobility include historical racial segregation (Andrews et al., 2017), the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1940 and 1970 (Derenoncourt, 2022), school finance reforms that equalize revenues across public school districts (Biasi, 2021), residual earnings and marriage rates (Rothstein, 2019), low birthweight (Robertson and O'Brien, 2018), and the level of violent crime (Sharkey and Torrats-Espinosa, 2017). Lefgren et al. (2020) find at most a very weak role for state-level policies in explaining spatial patterns of income mobility.====A number of papers have examined changes in mobility over time, both at the national level (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2008; Fletcher and Han, 2018; Hilger, 2017; Lee and Solon, 2009) and over a very long time span by region (Tan, 2019; Connor and Storper, 2020). Our paper documents substantial changes in mobility at the local level even over a much shorter time span. Chetty et al. (2014a) and Chetty et al. (2017) both study changes in income mobility for cohorts born in the late 20th century, and are the papers closest to ours. Chetty et al. (2014a) estimate roughly constant mobility across birth cohorts 1971–1993, where mobility is measured as the slope in a linear regression of the child's income rank or college attendance on parental income rank. Chetty et al. (2017) find a decline in the fraction of children who earn more than their parents, with a steady decrease for children born between 1940 and 1960, then a slower decline for children born between 1960 and the early 1980s.====Our work also contributes to a small literature that adds some qualifications to the findings produced by the Opportunity Insights project. Gallagher et al. (2019) argue that geographic differences in family characteristics can explain a large share of the spatial variation in income mobility documented by Chetty et al. (2014a). Similarly, Rothbaum (2016) finds that some spatial variation in forecasted causal effects of place in Chetty and Hendren (2018a, 2018b) can be attributed to geographic differences in resident characteristics.",Local changes in intergenerational mobility,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000598,12 April 2022,2022,Research Article,107.0

On average, substitute teachers are unable to mitigate this negative effect. However, there is substantial heterogeneity depending on the type of substitute teacher: certified substitute teachers are able to compensate for up to 25% of this negative impact, while non-certified substitute teachers have no statistically significant effect.","Teacher absence is a widespread phenomenon in many developed countries. On a typical school day in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, three to six percent of teachers are absent (Griffith, 2017). Despite the importance of this phenomenon, empirical evidence on the causal effect of teacher absence on productivity is scarce.==== Even less is known about the potential mitigating impact of substitute teachers. When a teacher is absent, how does it hurt her productivity? How easily can substitute teachers mitigate this effect?====I offer an empirical answer to these questions using a comprehensive administrative French panel dataset covering the 2007–2015 period, and matching, for each absence spell, each missing secondary school teacher to her substitute teacher. This paper estimates, for Math, French and History ninth grade teachers and their pupils: (a) the effect of the number of non-replaced days on pupil test scores; (b) how this impact can be mitigated by the assignment of substitute teachers; (c) how the impact of substitute teachers depends on their quality, measured by their certification status (certified versus non-certified teachers).====The main empirical challenge is the endogeneity of teacher absence and substitution. Existing literature suggests that teacher absence is correlated with observed and unobserved teacher and pupil characteristics (Ost and Schiman, 2017). I implement a two-way fixed effect model with teacher and classroom fixed effects to address this empirical challenge. This model exploits the longitudinal dimension of the data with teacher-school fixed effects. It also exploits the cross-sectional dimension of the data: in secondary school, teachers are subject-specific, and pupils stay with the same peers in the same classroom throughout the school year and for all subjects. This allows me to use variations within classroom, across subject. I perform several robustness checks to confirm that the results are not driven by (a) reverse causality: teachers are more absent when assigned to low performing pupils, and it is more difficult to find substitute teachers for these pupils; (b) the fact that absences are only a reflection of poor on-the-job teacher productivity.====Based on the analysis of more than 100,000 teachers and three million pupils, I show that teacher absence has a statistically significant negative impact on pupil test scores: one additional day of absence reduces pupil test scores by 0.03% of a standard deviation. This is consistent with previous causal estimates in developed countries (Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, 2009, Herrmann, Rockoff, 2012). As teachers miss an average of 13 days per year, the average effect of their absence is to reduce pupil test scores by around 0.40% of a standard deviation. The fraction of replaced absence days does not have any statistically significant compensating effect. However, one additional replaced day with a certified substitute teacher (as opposed to a missed day at school) mitigates 26% of the marginal impact of non-replaced days. The marginal impact of a replaced day with a non-certified substitute teacher (as opposed to a missed day at school) is not statistically significant.====I also estimate heterogeneity by teacher and absence spell characteristics to give suggestive evidence on the underlying mechanisms highlighted in a conceptual framework. I begin by estimating heterogeneity by length of absence spell. One of the predictions of the conceptual framework is that the longer the absence spell, the more pupils or their parents can adjust and put in place alternative compensating strategies such as private tutoring. I observe that the marginal impact of one additional day of non-replaced absence decreases with the length of the absence spell. This suggests that one long absence spell is less harmful to pupils than multiple shorter absence spells. I then turn to the role of the gap in general human capital between the regular and the substitute teachers. The main prediction from the conceptual framework is that the larger this gap, the smaller the mitigating effect of substitution. I use teacher experience as a measure of general human capital because the link between teacher experience and teacher productivity is well established in the literature (see Koedel et al., 2015 for a review). I find that the mitigating effect of certified substitution is not significantly impacted by the experience gap. This suggests that the results cannot be entirely explained by this mechanism. Next, I investigate the role of the specific human capital gap: teaching requires specific human capital that can be acquired only through prolonged and repeated interactions with pupils. First, I perform a heterogeneity analysis by month of the school year. I do not find that substitute teachers have a smaller compensating impact at the end of the school year, when the gap in specific human capital between the absent and the substitute teacher is the largest. Second, I compare planned absences with unplanned absences: with planned absence, absent teachers have the opportunity, prior to their absence, to reduce the gap in specific human capital with their substitute teachers by sharing content with them and giving them guidelines. I find that planned absences are slightly less disruptive for pupils. Thus, overall, evidence on the importance of this mechanism is mixed.====This paper makes several key contributions to several strands of the literature. First, my paper combines teacher fixed effects with classroom fixed effects to further deal with the endogeneity of teacher absence and substitution. Classroom fixed effects further address the issue of reverse causality. This is an advancement on previous literature on the causal effect of teacher absence on productivity (Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, 2009, Duflo, Hanna, Ryan, 2012, Herrmann, Rockoff, 2012, Miller, Murnane, Willett, 2008) which to date has only relied on teacher fixed effects.====Second, my paper provides an in-depth analysis of teacher substitution. I analyse whether absence spells are actually covered by a substitute teacher and, if so, by whom. Most previous papers on the causal effect on teacher absence do not analyse substitute teachers. Only Clotfelter et al. (2009) analyse substitute teachers, and they only compare the marginal effect of the number of absences covered by a certified substitute teacher to the marginal effect of the number of absences covered by a non-certified substitute teacher. I am able to identify the marginal effect of non-replaced and replaced days, irrespective of the type of substitute, where the counterfactual is a missed day of class. Given the important administrative and budgetary cost of substitute teachers, identifying the impact of non-replaced and replaced days is relevant for policy makers regardless of the substitute teachers’ certification status. From this perspective, my paper also contributes to the literature on instruction time (Lavy, 2015, Pischke, 2007). This literature finds that longer instructional time has a positive impact on pupil test scores and one-time grade progression. While these papers focus on variations in planned instruction time defined by law, I analyse how pupil achievement is affected by variations in the number of hours of instruction caused by non-replaced days of teacher absence.====Furthermore, I show that non-certified substitute teachers have no statistically significant impact on pupil test scores in the French context, where the certification process is very demanding and has low passing rates. This is an advancement on Clotfelter et al. (2009), who analyse the role of substitute teachers’ certification in the US context, where teacher certification is neither selective nor competitive (Koedel, 2011) and where existing evidence suggests that teacher certification is, at best, a weak predictor of teacher quality. While my results only apply to substitute teachers, they still provide suggestive evidence that a demanding and selective certification process may contribute to better teacher screening. This is consistent with the emerging literature on effective teacher screening (e.g., Jacob et al. (2018)).====Third, I perform several heterogeneity analyses by substitute teacher characteristics and absence spell characteristics, which allows me to explore some potential mechanisms underlying the impact of teacher absence on pupil achievement. I am able to test several hypotheses with respect to teacher substitutability, and the role of specific human capital. Existing evidence on worker substitutability and the role of specific human capital focuses on non-educational settings (Grinza, Rycx, 2020, Hensvik, Rosenqvist, 2016, Jäger, Heining, 2019). Teaching is particularly appropriate for the analysis of the relationship between human capital specificity (pupil-specific, grade-specific etc., see Ost (2014)) and substitutability because it is a complex, multidimensional task, based on direct, personal and prolonged interactions with the “output” (pupils).====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the French educational context. Section 3 presents a highly stylised conceptual framework to illustrate the mechanisms through which teacher absence and substitution affect pupil outcomes. Section 4 presents the data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 describes the empirical strategy, Section 6 the baseline results, and Section 7 the robustness checks.

We study these policies in a structural model of labor supply and child care use for couples in the Netherlands. Major reforms in family policies benefit the identification. We use differences-in-differences to assess the reliability of the model predictions. In-work benefits for secondary earners that increase with income are shown to be the most cost-effective tool for stimulating parental labor supply. Child care subsidies are less effective, as substitution of informal for formal care drives up public expenditures. We also relate our findings to related policies in the UK and US.","One of the central goals of family tax systems around the world is to encourage and support parental employment. This is evidenced by large endowments of fiscal instruments that are designed to do so. However, given the prominence of these instruments in national fiscal systems, it is interesting to note that there are large cross-country differences in the actual mix of fiscal policies targeted at working parents. For example, Scandinavian countries direct much of their public support to child care subsidies (Kleven, 2014, OECD, 2015), whereas Canada and the US rely more on in-work benefits (Immervoll and Pearson, 2009).==== And although these policies may differ to some extent in their objectives, a common goal is to stimulate employment of parents with young children.====A large body of literature studies the employment effects of child care subsidies (and related programs like pre-kindergarten and pre-school)====, and a similarly large body of literature studies the employment effects of in-work benefits for families with children.==== These two policy instruments are typically shown to have a positive effect on parental employment, However little is known about their relative effectiveness in terms of additional employment per dollar or euro spent. Cross-country comparisons of these policies are inevitably obfuscated by differences in the respective institutional and cultural settings, and within-country comparisons can be distorted by differences in timing of the reforms. It is therefore difficult to infer which policy works best for stimulating parental employment. This exercise is complicated further by the targeting of these policies, which is also highly country-specific.==== Indeed, the policy responses may be heavily influenced by targeting, and the optimal targeting strategy is likely to depend on the relative importance of labor supply responses on the extensive margin (participation) and intensive margin (hours worked per employed) (Saez, 2002).====In this paper, we offer a systematic analysis of child care subsidies and in-work benefits for couples with children, assessing their effectiveness in stimulating couples’ labor supply.==== Leveraging a structural model and large reforms of the Dutch family tax system, we quantify the public spending required per additional parent employed for several considered policy instruments. In doing so, we take into account parents’ behavioral responses to the policy instruments. Furthermore, we consider to what extent the targeting of these instruments at different income groups matters for their effectiveness. In this way, we study the equity-efficiency trade-off of family tax policies. We also consider how the effects of in-work credits based on individual earnings differ from those based on joint household earnings.====Our analysis rests on a structural discrete choice model of household labor supply and child care use in the Netherlands.==== We use a large and rich administrative household data set, the Labor Market Panel of Statistics Netherlands (2012), for the period 2006–2009 to estimate the couples’ work and child care preferences. We distinguish between the couples with the youngest child aged 0–3 (pre-primary school age) and couples with the youngest child aged 4–11 (primary school age). The model allows for the simultaneous choice of labor supply by the mother and the father, and the use of formal child care.==== In our preferred specification, we model unobserved heterogeneity using the random preference approach of Van Soest (1995). As a robustness check, we also estimate a more flexible specification of our model using the latent-class framework (Apps, Kabátek, Rees, Van Soest, 2016, Pacifico, 2013, Train, 2008). The identification of the structural parameters benefits from a major reform of child care subsidies and in-work benefits for working parents that took place in the period of observation, generating large exogenous variation in the couples’ budget sets. We also compare the predictions for the reform effects to the results of a differences-in-differences analysis. Furthermore, we consider an out-of-sample prediction, withholding the data for 2009 from the estimation of the structural parameters, and predicting the corresponding labor supply and childcare responses using our model. Finally, we also consider the contribution of the reform to the overall increase in the participation rate and hours worked of mothers and fathers in couples with young children.====Our main findings are as follows. First, we find that the most effective fiscal stimulus for working parents is an in-work benefit targeted at secondary earners that rises with their individual income. This policy provides incentives both on the extensive and the intensive margins of labor supply, and it is targeted at workers who are relatively elastic in their employment choices (mostly women with young children). Second, we find that child care subsidies are less effective than in-work benefits for secondary earners. The underlying reason is that childcare subsidies incentivize parents to substitute away from other, informal types of child care arrangements. This substitution drives up public expenditures, since the parents who switch child care types are often already employed. However, child care subsidies are still much more effective than in-work benefits for both primary and secondary earners, because the labor supply of primary earners is rather unresponsive to financial incentives. Third, we find that the effect of child care subsidies is not much lower when targeted at low-income households, compared to the policy targeted at middle- and high-income households. However, the knock-on effects (i.e., changes in public expenditures and receipts due to workers’ behavioral changes) are more favorable for the policy targeting the middle and higher income families, which is attributable to their higher tax burdens. So in the end, there is still a trade-off between equity and efficiency when it comes to the targeting of fiscal stimuli for working parents. We also show that implementing an in-work credit based on household as opposed to individual income would be detrimental to labor supply in the Netherlands, in particular for women with young children.====We make several contributions to the existing literature. We have a large and rich data set, combining high-quality administrative data, including working hours, hours of formal child care use, with relevant survey data on e.g. education and job search, for several years in which there was a large reform of child care subsidies an in-work benefits for families with young children. Hence, we can split the sample into subgroups, and estimate the model for families with pre-school children, and families whose children are in primary school, and allow for a rich set of interactions of preferences. This allows our model to capture differences by many demographic dimensions, like age of the youngest child, education and migration background. The reform also provides us with credible exogenous variation in budget sets, in contrast to previous structural analyses of labor supply and child care that mostly relied on cross-sectional variation. Furthermore, we can also relate the simulated reform effects of the structural model with to a differences-in-differences analysis (Bettendorf et al., 2015).==== Also, the structural model enables us to decompose the labor participation effect of the reform package into the effects caused by changes to the child care subsidies and the effects caused by changes to the in-work benefits. In addition, because our structural model is fully integrated with a detailed tax-benefit calculator, we are also able to study the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli for working parents in terms of additional employment generated per additional public euro spent. The integrated model allows us to go beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations of policy effectiveness (Blau, 2003, Lokshin, 2004). Although we study reforms implemented in the Netherlands, we argue that our findings are relevant for other developed OECD countries as well. Indeed, the participation rate of mothers and fathers in the Netherlands, as well as public spending on formal child care and pre-primary education, takes an intermediate position between Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries (OECD, 2015b). We show how a reform akin to the EITC in the US and WFTC in the UK, and the related CTC reforms, could impact labor market outcomes for couples in the Netherlands.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the labor market and policy environment in the Netherlands. Section 3 outlines the structural model, the empirical methodology and data used to estimate the preferences, and it also presents the empirical results in terms of simulated labor supply and price of child care elasticities. We also compare the predictions of the structural model for the policy reforms in the data period with a differences-in-differences analysis. In Section 4 we study the effectiveness of different fiscal stimuli for working parents, and also relate these policy reforms and estimated effects to the policies that are in place in the UK and US (like the WFTC and EITC, respectively).

The prevalence of new technology could result in a change in the relative demand for different types of labor, and thus, a change in their relative wages. According to the concept of capital–skill complementarity (Griliches, 1969),==== if ICT equipment is more complementary to skilled labor than unskilled labor, the increased use of ICT would raise the relative demand for skilled to unskilled labor, and thus, the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor. Nevertheless, it is unknown the extent to which the increased use of ICT can account for changes in the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor in many advanced countries.====We examine this issue by estimating a sector-level production function extended to allow for complementarity between ICT and skills. Our approach builds upon the aggregate production function developed by Fallon and Layard (1975) and Krusell et al. (2000). We focus on the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor, which is referred to as the skill premium or sometimes as the college premium. The skill premium is a key metric used to evaluate the level of wage inequality and its differences across countries. Changes in the skill premium can be interpreted as the outcome of the race between supply shifts due to advances in education and demand shifts due to developments in technology (Goldin, Katz, 2010, Tinbergen, 1974), and thus, can be decomposed into a part due to shifts in the relative supply of skills and a part due to shifts in the relative demand for skills. We refer to the supply shifts as the relative labor quantity effect. The advantage of our approach is that it enables us to decompose the demand shifts into a part attributable to observed factors such as specific capital and labor quantities and a part attributable to unobserved factors such as factor-augmenting technology. We refer to the former as the capital–skill complementarity effect and the latter as the relative factor-augmenting technology effect. Consequently, we can evaluate the extent to which changes in the skill premium are attributable to the expansion of ICT equipment. The impact of policies that increase skilled labor depends on the mechanisms through which the skill premium has changed over recent decades. This study aims to expand our understanding of the sources and mechanisms of changes in the skill premium by measuring the quantitative contribution of the three effects to changes in the skill premium in the goods and service sectors of advanced countries.====For this purpose, we make use of cross-country and cross-industry panel data from 14 OECD countries for the year 1970 to 2005. This brings two major advantages to the analysis. First, we can exploit the large variation in relative factor quantities across countries over time, which helps identify the elasticities of substitution between different types of capital and labor in production. In doing so, we exploit demand shocks in the service (goods) sector as a source of exogenous variation in factor supply in the goods (service) sector. Second, we can examine the sources and mechanisms of the differences in changes in the skill premium across countries. It is unclear from the literature the extent to which international differences in changes in the skill premium can be attributed to specific capital and labor quantities. Using the estimated production function, we decompose the sources of differences in changes in the skill premium across countries, as well as those of changes in the skill premium for each country and sector.====The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows. First, the estimated elasticity of substitution between ICT equipment and skilled labor is much smaller than that between ICT equipment and unskilled labor. This result supports the capital–skill complementarity hypothesis that ICT equipment is more complementary to skilled labor than unskilled labor. Second, the capital–skill complementarity effect associated with a rise in ICT equipment is large enough to account for a rise in the skill premium in the goods and service sectors of most OECD countries. The capital–skill complementarity effect is greater for the goods sector than the service sector in most OECD countries. Third, when ICT equipment is distinguished from non-ICT capital, changes in the skill premium are attributable mainly to observed capital and labor quantities in the goods and service sectors of the majority of OECD countries. Fourth, as its consequences, a large part of the differences in changes in the skill premium among those countries can be explained by the relative quantities of ICT equipment, skilled labor, and unskilled labor. Fifth, a rise in the relative demand for skilled to unskilled labor is attributable to a fall in the rental price of ICT equipment in the goods and service sectors of most OECD countries. Finally, a rise in skilled labor has a greater effect on reducing the skill premium in the presence than in the absence of capital–skill complementarity. This result points to the possibility that the contribution of higher education expansion to reducing the skill premium would be understated if capital–skill complementarity is not taken into account.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the sector-level production function used to account for changes in the skill premium.

The empirical strategy relies on variation in import competition across local labor markets based on their industrial composition before China entered the global market in 2001. In contrast to much of the existing literature, we find that import competition did not have persistent negative employment effects on men or led them to sort into the non-tradable or informal sectors. The adverse effects on the employment of low-educated women in the tradable sector, however, persist over time leading them to sort into the non-tradable sector or out of the labor force. The results are consistent with a mechanism in which gender occupational and industrial segregation leads to a widening of the gender gap in employment.","A long-standing finding in the international economics literature is that trade increases welfare and productivity through the reallocation of resources across firms, industries, and countries. In theory, although workers are displaced from industries affected by import competition, the long-run impact of openness to trade on employment could be non-negative as workers relocate to expanding industries (Melitz, 2003). However, the process by which firms adjust to increased import competition and the type of labor market frictions that workers face are likely to impact the adjustment process of workers, and have a ==== ambiguous distributional implications for workers who differ by gender and skill (Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Price, 2016, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2016, Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2019, Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016, Galor, Weil, 1996, Goldberg, Pavcnik, 2007, Sauré, Zoabi, 2014, Weinberg, 2000).====While numerous empirical studies have found that exposure to import competition leads to a long-term decline in the employment rates of low-educated men (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017, Ferreira, Leite, Wai-Poi, 2010), there is no consensus on the impacts of openness to trade on the demand for female workers or the gender gap in the labor market (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019, Erten, Keskin, 2020, Gaddis, Pieters, 2017, Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014).

In this paper, we add to this growing literature by providing novel evidence on the effects of import competition on the gender gap in employment and labor force participation in Peru and examine differences of the labor market adjustments between male and female workers in the long-term.====Our empirical strategy relies on China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. It uses variation in exposure to Chinese imports across Peruvian provinces according to their initial industrial composition before China entered the global market (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017, Topalova, 2007). The mapping of trade shocks across local labor markets follows early studies by Bartik (1991), Blanchard and Katz (1992), and Borjas and Ramey (1995), as well as more recent work on the labor market effects of trade liberalization in developing countries (Chiquiar, 2008, Gaddis, Pieters, 2017, Kovak, 2013, Topalova, 2007, Topalova, 2010), and on the labor market effects of Chinese imports competition on U.S. workers by Autor et al. (2013).==== Unlike trade liberalization policies in other Latin American countries (such as Brazil or Mexico) or the United States, both male- and female-intensive manufacturing industries in Peru were exposed to a large influx of Chinese imports after 2001.====While China’s entry into the global market was arguably unrelated to increased Peruvian demand for Chinese goods and did not coincide with other technological or productivity shocks domestically, we address any remaining endogeneity concerns using an instrumental variable strategy. Specifically, we use changes in Chinese imports of Peru’s neighboring countries or other upper-middle-income countries to instrument for changes in Peru’s imports from China (Autor et al., 2013). Furthermore, in contrast to much of the prior literature, we identify the industries that contribute the most to the variation in import exposure following Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020). In particular, we verify that the labor market shares of industries in trade-exposed markets are not correlated with other baseline local labor-market characteristics, such as the shares of female employment and college-educated people and the employment shares of the manufacturing and tradable sector.====Our main results show that the persistence of the trade-induced employment effects differs by gender. We find that both female and male low-educated workers in markets with greater exposure to Chinese imports experienced large short-term employment losses. However, while the negative employment effects for men dissipate over time, the adverse effects on women’s employment and labor force participation are long-lasting. These results are robust to controlling for baseline demographic and labor market characteristics and, key to our identification strategy, to the inclusion of pre-trends in these demographic and labor market characteristics between 1998 and 2001.====The persistent impact of import competition on women’s employment reflects gender differences in labor market adjustments. Specifically, we find that between 1998 and 2008, the employment share of low-educated women in the tradable sector fell by an average of 3.7 percent following an average increase of $170 in import competition per worker. We also find that women adjusted to the new labor market conditions by either moving to the non-tradable sector or by leaving the labor force, resulting in only a partial sectoral reallocation. In stark contrast, we find no evidence of reallocation between the tradable and non-tradable sectors for male workers. Although men’s employment share in the tradable sector declines shortly after China’s entry, the negative employment effects do not persist over time, there is no evidence of sorting into the non-tradable sector, or a decline in their participation rate. Thus, the results indicate that men adjusted to the new labor market conditions by reallocating to expanding industries within the tradable sector.====These reallocation results are robust to using an alternative set of instruments, controlling for a measure of export exposure, and excluding labor markets with a small number of observations or dropping Metropolitan Lima and the Constitutional Province of Callao. Furthermore, they are not explained by gender differences in workers’ migration patterns searching for better employment opportunities.====Importantly, we also find that exposure to import competition shifts the composition of workers who continue to be employed. For instance, we provide evidence that the decline in the employment share of low-educated women is primarily driven by a decrease in informal employment without a corresponding increase in the formal sector.==== In contrast, we find evidence that low-educated men reallocate from the informal to the formal sector in response to greater import competition, indicating improved labor market options.====These results differ from prior studies in developing countries which have found that men working in import-exposed labor markets move to the informal sector or the non-tradable sector (Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017, Ferreira, Leite, Wai-Poi, 2010, Menezes-Filho, Muendler, 2011). The results are also different compared to prior studies which have found no change in the employment gender gap in import-exposed markets (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019, Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2019, Erten, Leight, Tregenna, 2019, Gaddis, Pieters, 2017, McCaig, Pavcnik, 2018), and studies which found that import competition increases the demand for female labor (Anukriti, Kumler, 2019, Erten, Keskin, 2020, Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014).====In addition to providing novel evidence on gender differences in labor market reallocation, the paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the mechanisms through which the impact of trade liberalization differs by gender. For example, our results are not consistent with a pro-competitive channel that increases the demand for high-educated workers (Acemoglu, 2002, Thoenig, Verdier, 2003, Topalova, Khandelwal, 2011), lowers the demand for physically intensive skills (Galor, Weil, 1996, Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014, Weinberg, 2000), or reduces the cost of labor market discrimination (Becker, 1957, Black, Brainerd, 2004, Ederington, Minier, Troske, 2009, Standings, 1989). Instead, the results are consistent with a mechanism in which expanding industries in the tradable sector do not increase their demand for female workers either because of occupational gender segregation or imperfect substitutability between male and female workers (Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016, Gaddis, Pieters, 2017).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a conceptual framework and reviews the existing literature. Section 3 describes the data and defines local labor markets and the import competition shock.

Wage estimations controlling for the labour supply at the extensive and intensive margins confirm the presence of a female wage gap. A triangular joint estimation framework that identifies the wage determinants and the gender wage gap controls for the labour supply both in reservation hours and in actual working hours. The joint estimation of hourly wages, desired and actual weekly working hours, with the wages-hours relationship allowed to take non-linear forms, reduces the gender wage differentials and renders the gap insignificant for jobs that do not permit remote work.","Labour research has recognised the importance of discontinuity in the labour supply and the implications of it for wage estimation since Heckman (1979). Controls for the selection into labour force have become a standard element in wage estimations and are particularly important in estimating the wages of female employees. For women in contemporary economies, the supply of labour increasingly reflects their decision about the number of hours they spend on paid work, rather than the decision about whether or not to participate in the labour market. Blau and Kahn (2017) note that the wage and income elasticities of women declined substantially between 1980 and 2000, and they have approached the elasticities for men.====A large literature on the gender wage gap has investigated the differences in the average wage rates and the wage distributions for men and women, with varying degrees of success in explaining the gap. The unexplained wage differentials, which are suspected to be due to gender wage discrimination, may still actually be due to other factors that have not been identified. A substantial part of the gender wage gap literature pursues wage decompositions, which separate the explained gap in the differences in productivity characteristics from the unexplained or discriminatory gap in the differences in returns to productivity characteristics (Oaxaca, 1973; Machado and Mata, 2005; Fortin et al., 2011; Firpo et al., 2009). The literature on wage decompositions focuses on productivity enhancing human capital endowments such as education and work experience that are used in the production process, and for which the price may vary substantially, depending on the frictions in labour supply and demand. Unlike human capital endowments, working hours are real and easily measurable units of work effort and have a more direct relationship to wages. O’Neill and O’Neill (2005) conclude that working time and effort have more power to explain the gender wage gap than the gender differences in human capital endowments do.====The recent literature on the gender wage gap has paid increasing attention to the entire wage distribution beyond the differentials in mean wages. The results show substantial heterogeneity in the gender wage gap across the wage distribution, but without unequivocal evidence for the part of the wage distribution with the most distinctive wage gap (Blau and Kahn, 2006; del Río et al., 2011; Kassenboehmer and Sinning, 2014; Selezneva and Van Kerm, 2016).====The empirical evidence for how wage differentials are dependent on working hours is still limited, though the theoretical arguments for a nonlinear hour-wage relationship emerged several decades ago (Barzel, 1973; Moffitt, 1984). The likely reason why there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between wages and working hours is that the endogeneity of working hours adds more challenges to the bundle of empirical complications that are encountered in estimating wages (see also Kunze, 2008). Tummers and Woittiez (1991), Wolf (2002) and Gicheva (2013) explicitly estimate wages conditional on endogenous working hours, and all of them find that while wages depend on working hours, the estimated relationship varies in shape and strength across the hour-distribution.====I investigate how the wages of men and women relate to working hours and whether the gender differences in wage-work-hour patterns offer further insights into the gender wage differentials. To do this I control simultaneously for non-random selection into labour market participation at the extensive margin of the labour supply, and into desired and actual working hours at the intensive margin, allowing for a quadratic functional relationship between wages and working hours.==== The American Working Conditions Survey (2015) contains a representative sample of individuals who report their desired and actual working hours, their wage and their tenure, along with a number of workplace and individual background characteristics. In a simultaneous estimation framework with three dependent variables for wage, desired hours and actual working hours, I estimate the gender effect on the hourly wage rate.====The paper continues with a literature review in Section 2, outlining the research foundations and findings on the relation of wages to working hours, and on how non-uniform distributions of working hours impact gender wage differentials. Subsection 2.3 introduces the underlying model based on Goldin (2014) and Akerlof (1976).

One view of those “explicit” contracts argues that the prevailing wage structure reflects the labor market conditions back at the time when those contracts were bargained, with little space for renegotiation. An alternative view stresses that only workers close to the minima are affected by wage floors and that the wage structure reacts to current labor market conditions. We disentangle between those hypotheses by testing whether wages react more to local contemporaneous unemployment or unemployment at the time of contract renewal in Italy and Spain. The results suggest that most wages in the metalworking ==== adjusted to the cycle between 2005 and 2013, and that rigidity generated by lack of renegotiation is confined to wages close to the floors (about 12-15% of the total).","In many economies, unions and employer federations bargain skill-specific wage floors in collective contracts that are binding also for workers and employers not affiliated to any of the bargaining parties. For example, it is well known that the coverage of collective contracts in countries like France, Germany, Italy or Spain exceeds by far the fraction of workers affiliated to unions.==== A literature assumes that as the whole structure of wages is bargained infrequently, collective contracts introduce widespread downward nominal and real wage rigidity that, in turn, helps to propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks.==== An alternative view of collective contracts is that they only bind for the set of workers whose earnings are close to the bargained wage floors without necessarily hampering the responses of the rest of wages to the business cycle.==== However, the link between individual wages and wage floors set by collective agreements is not well known, mostly due to the unavailability of data. This study combines a novel dataset on more than 15,000 skill-specific wage floors and 1000 signature dates of collective contracts in the Italian and Spanish metalworking industry with detailed longitudinal employment histories in Social Security data and proposes a way to test which of the models of the labor market is consistent with the evolution of worker’s earnings over the business cycle. Importantly, the wage setting institutions differ in their degree of centralization (complete in Italy, regional in Spain) and renegotiation frequency (fixed in Italy, variable in Spain). According to Calmfors and Driffill (1988) those aspects have dramatic implications on wage and employment outcomes.====The test is the following. If collective contracts shaped the whole distribution of earnings, and those wages were completely rigid between renegotiation periods, then wage growth and the structure of wages should mainly reflect the labor market conditions back at the time when the prevailing collective contract was signed. A higher unemployment rate at the time of contract renegotiation would erode unions’ bargaining power by lowering their outside option so wages would be lower than in the case that labor market conditions had been more favorable. Conversely, if collective contracts affected only the earnings of workers close to the wage floors, the compensation of employees well above those minima should reflect contemporaneous labor market conditions. Hence, we assess the relevance of each model by regressing monthly earnings of workers on the current local unemployment rate and on the unemployment rate at the time of the collective contract renegotiation, allowing for heterogeneous responses depending on the distance between workers’ earnings and their corresponding wage floor -and controlling for individual and establishment fixed effects that capture worker’s innate ability and firm’s compensation policy.==== Importantly, we leverage on variation in wage cyclicality between the bottom and the rest of each collective contract band during the period 2005–2013, spanning the Great Recession, which witnessed around 6 p.p. increase in the national unemployment rate in Italy and as much as 20 p.p. in Spain. Furthermore, we extend our period of analysis back to 1995 to test whether the differential wage adjustment at the bottom versus the rest of the contract band is asymmetric (downward wage rigidity during recessions but no upward wage rigidity during expansions). We document three findings.====First, we present graphical evidence on the distribution of the percentage difference between individual earnings and the (province)-skill-year specific wage floors to document that wages set in collective contracts are binding indeed (====, see Card, Cardoso, 2021, Cardoso, Portugal, 2005 and Dolado et al., 1997). We document concentration around negotiated minimum wages: in both countries 3–4% of workers have wages very close to (at most 2.5% above) the bargained wage floor that corresponds to their skill level and (in Spain) the province of the employer. Furthermore, only a small fraction of workers receive monthly earnings below the corresponding minima. Secondly, we estimate how wage floors and actual wages adjust somewhat over the business cycle. A 1 p.p. increase in the unemployment rate back at the time of renewal decreases wage floors bargained in collective contracts by about 0.2% in both countries, a fact qualitatively consistent with previous findings.==== However, the unemployment rate at the time of renewal has a limited impact on the full structure of monthly earnings in the metalworking industry, and these effects are confined to workers with monthly earnings close to the wage floors. Namely, for workers earning at most 10% above the wage floors, a 1 p.p. increase in the unemployment rate back at the time of contract renewal reduces monthly earnings by about 0.1%. For this set of workers, wages could reflect the labor market conditions at contract renewal for several years up until the next renegotiation round takes place (see Kudlyak, 2014 for a similar mechanism). For workers earning at least 50% above the wage floors, a 1 p.p. increase in current unemployment diminishes their nominal wages by between ====0.54 and ====0.87%.==== We obtain similar estimates when we study cyclicality within firm-employee matches, as suggested by Gertler et al. (2020).====While the main results are similar in both countries, we detect differences in the way wages adjust to the cycle across the territory. In both countries, there is a large gap in economic performance across regions. We show that the bite of collective contracts is high and the cyclicality of wages is low in the South of Italy -a country where the metalworking agreement sets common wage floors across the country. In Spain instead, decentralization of collective bargaining at the province level results in a more homogeneous bite and cyclical wage response across regions.====Finally, we adapt previous work from Cengiz et al. (2019) on the impact of minimum wages and examine and explore how contemporaneous changes in the unemployment rate affect the full distribution of the average monthly (Spain) and daily (Italy) wage cushion. An increase in the unemployment rate by 1 p.p. reduces the fraction of workers earning at least 1.5 times their corresponding wage floors by 0.6 p.p., and increases accumulation at wage floors by between 0.4 (in Italy) and 0.2 p.p. (in Spain). When we decompose the margins of the response across different types of workers and firms, we find that adjustment mechanisms differ across the two economies. In Italy, all changes in the wage structure along the business cycle happen among job stayers, while in Spain new entrants account for about half of the observed cyclicality. In both countries, increases in the unemployment rate result in accumulation at wage floors only for workers in small firms.====Taken together, those results suggest that, while the determinants of wages vary over the earnings distribution, for most workers in the metalworking sector in Italy and Spain, earnings do adjust over the business cycle. In that sense, our results suggest that collective bargaining agreements may introduce downward wage rigidity but for workers whose monthly earnings are at most 1.1 times above the relevant wage floor (roughly 10% of the workforce in the sector in each country, according to our estimates). For the rest of the distribution, wage responses are similar in magnitude to those in other European countries (Verdugo, 2016).====We make three contributions to the literature on wage cyclicality and collective bargaining. Firstly, we provide comparable estimates of the distribution of workers’ wages around wage floors in two economies where collective bargaining agreements are widespread. Several studies have estimated wage cushions for a single country, using different datasets and methods.==== Our study provides visual comparisons of how many workers are likely affected by wage floors in the metalworking sector in Italy and Spain. Both countries differ in key wage setting features (national vs provincial bargaining, pre-specified vs varying duration), so we can examine if those characteristics alter the bite of collective bargaining. For example, the differencial economic performance between the North and the South of Italy is often attributed to very high wage floors established in nationwide collective bargaining (Boeri et al., 2021). By using similar datasets and methods, we can compare the regional distribution of the wage cushion in Italy to that in Spain, a country with bargaining decentralized at the province level.====Secondly, we exploit longitudinal data and estimates of the distance between a worker’s wage and the relevant wage floor. That information allows us to assess the role of the wage cushion in shaping changes in earnings during a recession while controlling for worker- and firm-level heterogeneity. For example, Fanfani (2019) and other studies note that average earnings growth correlates with wage growth bargained in collective contracts -a finding that supports the notion that whatever the determinants of growth of negotiated minimum wages are, they spill over the full distribution of earnings.==== Indeed, we provide visual evidence of an apparent stability of repeated cross-sectional distributions of the wage cushion in both countries during the onset and aftermath of the Great Recession. However, once we examine within-worker wage changes and account for the distance between workers’ earnings and the wage floor, most wages do react to changes in contemporaneous unemployment.==== The apparent stability of the wage cushion is the consequence of job quality changes over the business cycle (well-studied in Solon et al., 1994 or Carneiro et al., 2012).====Thirdly, a large literature infers the degree of wage rigidity from the response of wages to changes in national unemployment or other cyclical measures. Some studies document that wages are cyclical while others stress that they are rigid, possibly because of the existence of collective agreements.==== We propose a new test that allows for the existence of both models in a joint framework, evaluate the relevance of each of them at different points of the distribution of the wage cushion and link the differential responses to direct measures of the bite of collective contracts.",Wage determination and the bite of collective contracts in Italy and Spain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000409,9 March 2022,2022,Research Article,114.0

We use long-running panel data from the Netherlands (LISS) and complement the core survey with our own COVID-specific module, conducted in June 2020. The survey provides data on the job search effort in terms of the number of applications of employed as well as unemployed respondents. We estimate an empirical model of job search over the business cycle over the period 2008–2019 to explore the gap between predicted and actual job search behavior in 2020. We find that job search during the pandemic recession differs strongly from previous downturns. The unemployed search significantly less than what we would normally observe during a recession of this size. For the employed, the propensity to search is even greater than what we would expect, but those who do search make significantly fewer job applications. Expectations about the duration of the pandemic seem to play a key role in explaining job search effort for the unemployed in 2020. Furthermore, employed individuals whose work situation has been affected by COVID-19 are searching more actively for a new job.","Do individuals still look for jobs during a pandemic? On the face of it, doing so seems futile. In virtually all countries, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered one of the most severe economic downturns in modern history: lockdowns and government restrictions sharply curtailed economic activity, consumers were held back by fears of infection (Goolsbee and Syverson, 2021), and missing childcare and health concerns weakened labor supply (Alon et al., 2020). Given the recession and the degree of unprecedentedness which makes forming expectations particularly difficult, individuals may believe there is no point to searching. However, the pandemic also changed the structure of the economy and caused substantial employment losses. As a result, individuals may search more to take advantage of the increased ability to work from home or to pivot into a less affected industry. Understanding job search during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to form a complete picture this extraordinary economic event and may provide valuable insights for economic policy-making in case of similar recessions in the future.====In this paper, we study job search behavior in a pandemic recession. Specifically, we ask whether employed and unemployed individuals search more or less than during a normal recession. We then examine potential drivers of job search during the pandemic: Are concerns over health and safety an obstacle to job search? Do employment shocks on an individual level increase job search effort? What is the role of beliefs about the duration of economic restrictions? To answer these questions, we use data from a long-running panel survey in the Netherlands (LISS), complemented by a specific survey on job search behavior during the pandemic.====The Dutch labor market was strongly hit by the pandemic. The number of vacancies decreased by 30% and the Dutch economy contracted by 8.5% in Q2/2020. However, due to strong labor protection laws and extensive support programs, the effects of the pandemic turned out to be milder than in some other developed countries (such as the UK and the US, see Zimpelmann et al., 2021). Households did not experience a significant shock to their income, and the unemployment rate increased by only 1.5 percentage points. After an initially restrictive lockdown in spring 2020, social and economic life was largely back to what it used to be by summer 2020, when our job search data was collected. Nevertheless, uncertainty about a possible second wave of the pandemic persisted and it was unclear for how long the labor market would be affected.====Our data are based on a probability sample of the Dutch population and provide annual information on about 5,000 individuals from the year 2008 onward. We complement the core LISS survey with a COVID-19-specific module (conducted in June 2020) surveying the panel respondents about their job search effort, including the number of applications sent over the past two months. Importantly, given the relatively low levels of unemployment, we collect the data on both the employed and the unemployed. We also ask about the respondents’ expectations about the economy and changes in their preferences over work arrangements. Other modules from earlier months of 2020 allow us to merge in data on childcare provision, individual beliefs about the health risks, and other information related to the pandemic.====The analysis proceeds in two steps. We start by looking at the 2020 recession through the lens of traditional business cycle fluctuations. We estimate a reduced-form model of job search over the most recent business cycle (2008–2019), and use these results to predict job search behavior in 2020 given the state of the economy and the composition of the employed and unemployed in 2020. This allows us to explore the gap between the predicted and actual job search behavior in 2020. In the second step, we focus on individual job search effort in 2020, regressing it on a broad set of variables capturing expectations about the labor market and the pandemic, experienced changes to the work environment, and subjective health risk. This allows us to explore which of the several pandemic-related shocks had the biggest impact on job search behavior.====Our main finding is that the usually strong counter-cyclical pattern of job search effort in the Netherlands no longer holds during the pandemic. The unemployed search significantly less than what we would normally observe during a recession of this size. In fact, the unemployed search less (both along the extensive and intensive margin) in 2020 than they did on average in the five years before the pandemic. For the employed, a mixed pattern emerges. While their propensity to search is even greater than what we would expect given the state of the economy, those who do search make significantly fewer job applications. Overall, the pandemic led to a significant drop in the number of job applications on the aggregate level.====Second, our analysis suggests that the main drivers behind this divergence are the economic impacts of the pandemic, rather than the direct health-related factors. Workers affected by changes in their hours worked, and those in the hardest hit sectors, search differently than in a normal recession. Economic expectations about the pandemic – and the uncertainty about the duration and severity of the downturn – also play a significant role. Consistent with an inter-temporal substitution mechanism, we find that unemployed individuals who expect a short and temporary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market search relatively little compared to individuals that expect this impact to be long and severe. On the other hand, we do not find evidence that health concerns prevent people from searching: employed women search even more when they believe their infection risk is high.====This paper contributes to the quickly expanding literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor market outcomes of households (e.g. Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020, Crossley, Fisher, Low, 2020, Zimpelmann, von Gaudecker, Holler, Janys, Siflinger, 2021, Meekes et al., 2020). The existing studies focus on changes in working hours, furlough schemes, and job separations; there has been relatively less attention given to job search and labor supply decisions in general.====The main source of data on job search during the pandemic are online job platforms. This data indicates that both labor demand (vacancies) and labor supply as measured by job applications dropped strongly (Hensvik et al., 2021, Bauer et al., 2020, Marinescu et al., 2020). The advantage of our paper lies in making use of representative and rich panel survey data, which allows us to go beyond measurement to analyze ==== drives the drop in search during the pandemic.==== Another advantage is the ability to distinguish between job search of the employed and the unemployed. In line with Faberman et al., 2020 we find that search on the job differs substantially from job search during unemployment. Given the widespread use of labor hoarding policies, search on the job becomes particularly important to understanding aggregate job search activity.====In this respect, we also contribute to the literature analyzing the determinants of job search. We show that job finding expectations (Mueller et al., 2021) and the duration of unemployment (Lichter, Schiprowski, 2021, DellaVigna et al., 2021) matter during the pandemic, but we also provide evidence of additional pandemic-specific factors which drive job seekers’ behavior.====Our final contribution is to the macro-labor literature on job search over the business cycle.

Labor market institutions affect this process by influencing agents’ behavior, as they alter the costs and benefits of such decisions. An extensive literature points to employment protection legislation as one of the most relevant institutions hindering labor reallocation (Bentolila, Bertola, 1990, Blanchard, Portugal, 2001, Lazear, 1990, Postel-Vinay, Turon, 2014, Pries, Rogerson, 2005). By directly increasing adjustment costs, employment protection leads firms to inefficiently continue labor relationships (Garibaldi, Pacelli, 2008, Kugler, Pica, 2008, Marinescu, 2009). Hiring decisions are also affected if employers anticipate future costs associated with workforce adjustments (Cahuc, Malherbet, Prat, 2019, Kugler, Pica, 2008).====In practice, one of the key components of employment protection legislation raising firms’ adjustment costs are mandated severance packages |lump-sum transfers from the firm to the worker upon dismissal (OECD, 2013b). These transfers increase the opportunity cost of job quit, thereby making workers more reluctant to voluntarily leave their employers to avoid losing the benefits they are entitled to (Burdett, 1978, Light, Omori, 2004, Mitchell, 1982, Mortensen, 1977). This suggests an additional channel through which employment protection may alter labor reallocation, i.e., workers’ mobility out of the firm. Yet, the effect of severance pay generosity on workers’ decisions compounds labor supply and demand forces, so that its magnitude is an empirical question that has not been widely studied in the literature. In this paper, I exploit a major labor market reform in Spain to investigate the link between employment protection legislation and workers’ voluntary mobility.====The Spanish labor market reform was enacted in February 2012 and substantially changed severance pay entitlements for permanent contracts. On the one hand, it reduced severance payments for the so-called “unfair” dismissals, which were the most common type of dismissal. On the other hand, it facilitated low-cost dismissals due to economic reasons, also know as “fair” dismissals. An important feature of the legislative change is that it affected all permanent contracts from the date of the reform. This implies that workers hired around the date of the reform have almost identical severance packages. Moreover, all permanent workers are equally affected by the reform, making it difficult to separate the impact of the policy change from other factors. These two issues rule out the possibility of standard before-and-after comparisons of job quit probabilities.====My thought experiment, rationalized by a job search model with endogenous separations and severance pay, is to follow workers over time up to job quit and exploit the differences in severance pay generated by the reform in a dynamic framework. Consider two identical workers who have the same tenure, but who are observed in different years because they were hired on different dates. Hence, one of them is affected by the reform and the other is not (yet). Consequently, they will have different severance pay entitlements. The dynamic approach allows to identify the effect of severance pay on voluntary mobility by comparing job quit probabilities of individuals who are at the same stage in their job, but who are affected differently by the reform.====To isolate the effect of the reform from confounding factors, my strategy exploits employees of companies that shut down or implemented a mass layoff during the sample period as the treatment group. The goal is to rely on these large employment contractions to identify firm-specific conditions that may affect workers’ expectations of future displacement, i.e., a layoff shock. Then, I look at labor mobility during the year prior to the employment contraction, when layoff expectations are likely to be distorted due to the worsening of the firm’s economic situation, but individuals are unlikely to be able to predict when and under what circumstances they will be laid-off. For this group of workers, severance pay represents the main mobility cost in the form of foregone income. Thus, one could expect higher job quit probabilities for these workers compared to those who do not experience such an increase in layoff probabilities, since the reform directly reduced the expected value of being laid-off for the first group of individuals.====Using Spanish Social Security data, I implement my empirical strategy by estimating a discrete time duration model for the probability of job quit. The 2012 Spanish labor market reform together with the layoff shock are introduced as time-varying variables that affect the probability of job quit from the exact moment they occur. In this setting, identification is based on comparing quit hazard rates among individuals who are at the same point in time in their jobs, but who are affected differently by the policy change and the layoff shock.====The empirical analysis points to a behavioral response of workers to severance pay generosity. In fact, the job quit hazard rate for workers who might expect to be displaced in the near future increased by roughly 17.5 percent after the policy change compared to workers not affected by the increase in layoff probabilities. This shift is driven by faster job-to-job transitions, suggesting an increase in job search effort. Moreover, the change in voluntary mobility is larger for workers who were more exposed to the reform, implying that mobility costs are an important source hindering workers’ voluntary mobility. Under my identification strategy, the reduced form parameter quantifies the effect of severance pay generosity on workers’ voluntary mobility that arises from both labor supply and demand forces. The findings are consistent with a labor market model with search frictions and separations that are either employee-initiated (quits) or employer-initiated (layoffs). In this class of models, severance pay distorts workers’ voluntary mobility decisions by directly affecting the expected utility of being laid-off: the value of unemployment. In addition, by decreasing the expected value of posting a vacancy, lower firing costs may further ease workers’ voluntary mobility through its impact on labor demand.====This paper adds to different strands of the literature. The study contributes to the empirical literature on employment protection legislation and labor mobility by shifting the focus of the analysis from the impact on firms’ decisions to the effect on workers’ behavior. Closely related to this paper are Gielen and Tatsiramos (2012) and Kettemann et al. (2017). Gielen and Tatsiramos (2012) study the effect of employment protection on quit rates in a cross-country analysis for the period 1992–2001. Their evidence indicates that job quality is an important determinant of quits, but the strictness of the employment protection affects this relation: lower employment protection levels translate into higher quit rates. The current analysis complements this study by exploiting within-country variation in the stringency of employment protection to provide a causal estimate of the effect of severance pay on workers’ voluntary mobility.====Kettemann et al. (2017) build upon a regression discontinuity design to analyze a prominent reform in Austria that took place in 2003. The reform abolished the severance pay system and introduced an occupational pension scheme. In the old system, only laid-off workers were entitled to severance pay. In the new occupational pension system, workers accumulate rights in an individual account that is transferred from one company to another upon separation, regardless of whether the worker was fired or left voluntarily. Under this new system, workers are 60 percent more likely to make a job-to-job transition. Contrary to Kettemann et al. (2017), I exploit a labor market reform that creates exogenous variation across job spells to provide direct evidence on the role of the stringency of employment protection on workers’ quit behavior. In addition, the dynamic nature of my empirical strategy allows me to control not only for business cycle effects and workforce composition changes, but also time variation within the employment relationship that is disregarded in static approaches. Namely, it takes into account idiosyncratic changes in the nature of the relationship between employer and employee that may arise as key determinants of the decisions of firms and workers to dissolve the match (Jovanovic, 1979). The dynamic approach also permits me to consider only job spells that started before the reform moment. This is key in the current setting, as the matching process between firms and workers may change as a consequence of the reform and, hence, affect the future development of new labor relationships beyond severance pay entitlements.====This paper also contributes to understanding the effect of job loss insurance schemes on worker mobility. Empirical research on this issue has mostly focused on the role of unemployment insurance on job turnover (Albanese, Ghirelli, Picchio, 2020, Light, Omori, 2004, Martins, 2021, Rebollo-Sanz, 2012). These studies show that eligibility and generosity of unemployment benefits distorts the utility associated with future unemployment, thereby deterring job quits and increasing layoff rates once the eligibility condition is met. In this paper, I show that the stringency of the employment protection in the form of severance pay levels also has an impact on job quits similar to that of unemployment benefits. This revealed relationship further points to the relevance of jointly designing employment protection legislation and the unemployment insurance system, as they insure the same type of risk (Blanchard, Tirole, 2008, Parsons, 2014).====Finally, an extensive literature looking at the consequences of job loss relies on mass layoffs and plant closings to show that (exogenously) displaced workers incur in large and long-lasting losses related to lower re-employment probabilities and future earnings (Davis, von Wachter, 2011, Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993, Lachowska, Mas, Woodbury, 2020). By using large employment contractions in the empirical strategy, this paper adds to the literature on job displacement by showing that the institutional setting affects the composition of workers who are ultimately displaced. In particular, my results indicate that lower severance payments make workers more likely to quit before the upcoming employer event occurs, thus affecting the pool of workers within the displacement event (Lengermann, Vilhuber, et al., 2002, Schwerdt, 2011).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the institutional setting. Section 3 describes the theoretical framework and the identification strategy. Section 4 provides a description of the data, whereas Section 5 discusses the implementation of the empirical strategy and the results.

The city of New Orleans implemented a job training programme funded by the U.S. Department of labour Workforce Innovation Fund. They screened potential trainees for suitability and likelihood of completing and benefiting from training. They selected and developed curriculum with input from local firms. The city implemented the training as a randomized controlled trial. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the training on employment, earnings, and industry of employment, both overall and separately by baseline employment status. We find overall positive effects for earnings, driven by those who did not have a job at the time of training enrolment. We also find positive employment effects for short-term unemployed workers. Individuals in the treatment group were more likely to work in the target ====, suggesting that the gains were happening through the gains in industry-specific human capital.","Labour markets have become increasingly focused on knowledge-based industries, which require higher levels of technical skills. There is a resulting widening of the gap between the skills needed in the marketplace and those available from existing workers, with companies unable to fill vacancies and grow at the rate which they would like. As a result, the wage disparity between high- and low-skilled workers has grown (Acemoglu, 2002). Many workers with few or obsolete skills face diminishing demand, and worsening labour outcomes. These forces have combined to increase the polarization of job quality and income, leading to widening inequality (Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor et al., 2006; Goos and Manning, 2007; Goos et al., 2014).====Providing effective pathways for unemployed and underemployed workers into sustainable and sustaining employment is a critical policy issue to combat both poverty and inequality. Active Labour Market Programmes (ALMP) provide potential interventions to improve worker outcomes, and training programmes are a common type of ALMP (Brown and Koettl, 2015; Kluve, 2010). These educational programmes have the potential to increase the human capital of these workers, better positioning them in the workforce landscape with in-demand skills. There are several types of programmes aimed at workforce development through increasing human capital, including formal post-secondary education (four-year and two-year college), vocational and career education, apprenticeships, job training programmes, and on-the-job training. These differ in the funder, the provider, and the format of the training. These types of programmes have shown promising returns in some settings, albeit not in every instance. Publicly-subsidized training programmes are typically medium-length (often between one week and one year) and have training provided by various entities, including community colleges, private training organizations, employers, and the government itself. Such programmes have existed in the United States and Europe for several decades and have a robust research base. The existing literature has found that the programmes can be effective, but are not always so (Van Horn et al., 2015; Fortson et al., 2017; Brown and Koettl, 2015).====Two of the issues that hurt the effectiveness of training programmes are high attrition and mismatches between skills provided and local labour demand. To that end, the New Orleans Office of Workforce Development (OWD) designed and implemented ====, funded by a US Department of labour (DOL) Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) grant. WIF grants are authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) passed in 2014. Career Pathways offered training for unemployed and underemployed individuals relevant for medium-skilled jobs in the advanced manufacturing, health care, and information technology (IT) sectors. OWD purposefully chose the industries and developed the curriculum in coordination with local firms, critical features of successful programmes referred to as demand-driven training. Further, to combat programme attrition, potential trainees were screened by various profiling tools before they were allowed entry into the randomization pool and thus into training. For evaluation purposes, the programme was implemented as a randomized controlled trial (RCT).====In this paper, we examine new and important aspects of the impact of the Career Pathways programme. In Baird et al. (2019), we evaluated the Career Pathways and found it to lead to increased earnings, especially for those unemployed at entry into the programme. We add to those findings and to the overall literature on effectiveness of job training programmes in several ways. First, while we are examining the same intervention as in Baird et al. (2019), we obtained more data than used in that report, expanding from that analysis of 13 training cohorts to 20 cohorts in this paper, as well as examining post-training outcomes for an additional six months. Additionally, the programme allowed for persons randomized into a control group to enter later randomization pools, resulting in some individuals moving from the control group to the treatment group in later quarters. We account for these individuals in a different manner than in Baird et al. (2019) (particularly important given our longer timeline and 7 additional later cohorts), eliminating the risk of bias from the selection of motivated repeaters out of the control group.====This paper also differs from Baird et al. (2019) by focusing on an important moderator of the outcomes, the individual's baseline employment status (has a job, short-term unemployed, long-term unemployed). Baird et al. (2019) grouped short and long term unemployed together in evaluating this moderator, and did not examine it across all the outcomes examined here. Understanding treatment effect heterogeneity is important, as it helps to shed light on how trainees are or are not benefiting, which can be used for targeting of interventions, developing appropriate post-training supports (in areas where they are not succeeding), and building best practices.====We find that the training is effective in terms of increasing earnings: the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimate of $436/quarter yields about a 12 % increase over the control group; the local average treatment effect (LATE) estimate using an instrumental variable estimator for those who attended training is $1054/quarter for about a 30 % increase over the control group. The effectiveness of the programme is largest for short-term unemployed trainees, a group of particular interest. For them, the ITT estimate is $1450. This group also has positive and significant estimates for the impact of the programme on the probability of being employed. We also find that trainees were more likely to work in target industries, although this effect does not seem as differentiated amongst employment groups.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the prior literature regarding job training programmes for adults. Section 3 discusses the context, provides a conceptual framework, and presents the data sources used in this analysis.

We study the impact of a natural experiment that took place in 1995 when U.S. patent law was amended with a special provision that provided an incentive for firms to hasten research. We also utilize the randomized assignment of examiners to patent applications to identify firms under time pressure. We find that firms under time pressure assemble larger research teams. With innovation races becoming more competitive globally, our finding sheds light on the trend of increasing teamwork in research.","It is well noted in economics and management literature that technology companies are increasingly exposed to time-based competition (Stalk and Hout, 1990). They are pressed by global market competition to better manage time in innovation, new product development, production, and distribution (Griffin, 2002; Lukas, Menon and Bell, 2002; Carbonell and Rodriguez, 2006; Chen, Reilly and Lynn, 2012; Cankurtaran, Langerak and Griffin, 2013).====With innovation races among technology firms becoming ever more competitive due to first-mover advantage, increasing international competition, and stronger IP protection, innovating firms are under growing pressure to complete research projects and introduce products to the market as quickly as possible. Agarwal and Gort (2001) studied how long first-mover advantage was preserved for 46 major product innovations and discovered that the average time span between the commercial introduction of a new product and the entry of later competitors was almost 33 years at the turn of the century and had already declined to 3.4 years by 1967–86. Nagaoka, Igami, Walsh and Ijichi (2011) report that the time elapsed from the launch of a research and development (R&D) project until the journal submission of a paper on the project becomes shorter if the perception of competitive threat is higher.====How would innovating firms respond to time pressure vis-à-vis the management of the research enterprise? Accelerating research production implies an increase in output per unit of time. To increase outputs, R&D firms will, in general, increase all types of production inputs for research, including equipment and materials. The extensive margin of labor is certainly another dimension that can be affected in this endeavor. In other words, firms may put together a team with more R&D personnel to hasten the invention process. In this study, we empirically investigate whether R&D firms respond to time pressure with a larger research team size.====For this investigation, we utilize two types of data, both collected from U.S. patent records. We first investigate the impact of a natural experiment that took place in 1995 when U.S. patent law was amended with a special provision that provided an incentive for firms to hasten research.====After 12-year long negotiations among 123 countries, the Uruguay Round Agreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) were signed on April 15, 1994; these included the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). In the U.S., the Uruguay Round Agreements Act was enacted on December 8, 1994. One key change implemented in this Act was an amendment to the U.S. patent law, which was put into effect on June 8, 1995, exactly six months after the Act was passed.====Prior to 1995, U.S. patent protection ended 17 years after the patent issue date.==== The amendment changed the patent term to 20 years after the patent filing date for patent applications filed after June 8, 1995. A special provision of the new law designed to ease the transition guaranteed that patent applications that were filed between December 8, 1994 and June 7, 1995, but not issued as of June 8, 1995, enjoyed a patent term of 17 years post issuance or 20 years post filing, whichever was longer.====This provision presented an incentive for research firms to file before the deadline on June 8 inventions that were expected to have a longer monopoly period under the old system than under the new system.==== Firms were thus encouraged to speed up the research on such inventions. Our first investigation tackles the question of whether patents filed just before the deadline had a larger number of inventors than the predicted trend.====Although the 1995 amendment as a natural experiment provides us with an excellent opportunity to study the effect of time pressure, it is likely that R&D firms did not change capital and production scale when they acted upon the knowledge of the upcoming law amendment because the benefit was temporary. Therefore, the special provision of the new law did not induce long-term, comprehensive responses by R&D firms in the form of labor input, which may not be applicable to the situation of time-based competition that innovating firms constantly face. Thus, we seek additional evidence for the long-term impact of time pressure on team size by studying U.S. patent data on the examination process of patent applications.====When a patent application is filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), it is randomly assigned to an examiner from among expert examiners in the relevant trade. The application then goes through a back-and-forth process between the applicant and the examiner, which is also known as patent prosecution and is similar to the review process that academic papers undergo. Our strategy to identify applicants (firms) under time pressure is based on the assumption that such applicants will spend less time in responding to office actions from the USPTO during prosecution to have the patent granted as early as possible. We then check whether applicants with shorter response times are associated with patents with larger team sizes.====In this strategy, we note a potential endogeneity problem of an applicant's response time in the analysis of team size for at least two reasons. First, a patent with more inventors can afford more personnel who can be deployed to respond to the USPTO's actions, which can reduce the response time. This concern pertains to reverse causality. The second reason is related to the omitted variable problem. A patent that lists more inventors may relate to a more complicated invention and is, therefore, likely to take more time to respond to the office's actions with an argument or an amendment to the patent.====As a remedy for the endogeneity problem, we employ the instrumental variable approach, where we utilize the patent office's practice of randomized assignment of patent examiners to applications. Righi and Simcoe (2019) show that examiners in some cases are not randomly assigned, but rather specialized in particular classes of technologies as well as in particular patent assignees (that is, filing firms). Our analysis takes up their suggestion to control for technology classes and applicant identities in constructing our instrumental variable. We discuss this issue further in Section V.A.====Our inquiry into the main question of this study is motivated by stylized facts about research. Increasing teamwork in science and research is well documented in numerous studies using various data sources. In the U.S. patent data, the average number of inventors listed on a patent, a measure of the size of a research team, rose from 1.70 for patents filed in the first half of 1975 to 2.67 for those filed in the second half of 2000 (see Fig. 1). The data show that while 47.1 percent of the U.S. patents filed in 1975 listed multiple inventors, the same was true of 69.8 percent of the U.S. patents filed in 2000.====Increasing team size has been witnessed in academic publications in science as well (Jones et al., 2008). The average number of authors of scientific papers written in top U.S. universities increased by approximately 50 percent over the period 1981–1999 (Adams et al., 2005). In the natural sciences, 1.9 authors were listed per paper on average in 1955, compared to 3.5 authors in 2000 (Wuchty et al., 2007).====Our probe of firms’ response to time pressure will shed light on how they respond to time-based competition and provide a plausible explanation for the rising team size in research. As innovating firms compete globally under more severe time pressure, it is expected that they would put together a team with more R&D personnel to complete research projects quicker.====From a broader perspective, this study is also related to a fertile research area in recent years that studies the impact of legal policies on innovation. Exploiting an event of compulsory licensing after World War I when the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act made all German-owned patents available for licensing to U.S. firms, Moser and Voena (2012) and Baten et al. (2017) show that compulsory licensing increased industrial inventions in the United States and Germany. Williams (2013) finds that gene-level intellectual property rights on existing technologies lead to reductions in subsequent innovation. In this study, we investigate the impact of patent policies on the quantity (patent count) and quality (speed) of innovation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a simple theoretical framework to guide our analysis. In Section III, we describe the data. In Section IV, we investigate the impact of the 1995 Patent Law Amendment on team size. We explain the empirical strategy and specification for our analysis and report the empirical results from the analysis in this section. Section V presents the empirical findings from the analysis of the response times during patent prosecution. In Section VI, we discuss the implications of our results for rising team size in research and conclude the paper.",Teamwork in innovation under time pressure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000306,2 February 2022,2022,Research Article,118.0

In this paper, we jointly estimate natural unemployment and participation rates (i.e. compatible with constant inflation) through an augmented PC informed by structural labor market flows across employment, unemployment and inactivity. Focusing on Italy we find that, during the pandemic: (i) natural unemployment has remained unchanged, while natural participation has declined slightly, mostly due to a rise in retirement flows driven by a temporary reduction in pension eligibility rules; (ii) virtually all slack was accounted for by the participation margin, which added significant downward pressures to ==== dynamics."," for example find that the participation margin accounts for one third of the cyclical fluctuation of the unemployment rate in the USA.====Starting from this fact, in this paper we provide an assessment of labor market slack in Italy based on both the unemployment and the participation margin. To do so, we employ the model presented in ==== that in turn generalizes ==== by explicitly taking into account movements into and out of the labor force. The participation margin can provide useful information on total labor market slack: a participation rate that is below its natural level is an indication that the economy is running below potential, for instance because some inactive workers may have temporarily exited from the labor market waiting for better employment opportunities. A Phillips curve model featuring both an unemployment and a participation gap provides a measure of total labor market slack that properly takes into account also temporary movements into and out of activity, a feature that makes such model particularly attractive during the pandemic.====Estimates are obtained in two steps. First, using the flow-based model of unemployment dynamics proposed by ==== along with an unobserved component model, we retrieve the ==== (i.e. coherent with stable inflation) unemployment and participation rates through a forward-looking Phillips Curve.====The analysis of the flows reveals that transitions into inactivity from both unemployment and employment raised substantially during the Covid crisis. While the former increased for all demographic groups, the latter increased in particular for mature (55–64) workers, interrupting a long-term declining trend that was fostered by reforms restricting public pension eligibility (====). After distinguishing the structural component of these changes in labor market flows and comparing the pre-Covid (2019) projections for structural unemployment and participation rates with their actual 2020 evolution, overall we find no sizable impact of the Covid recession on structural unemployment, and a slight decrease in structural participation (0.24 percentage points in 2020q3-4). Such a decrease is present in all demographic groups but it is larger for mature (55–64) workers; the aggregate effect, indeed, is mostly determined by the behaviour of the elderly. Additional evidence suggests that the drop in participation of older workers is mostly driven by an increase in retirement probability, made possible by a three-year temporary reduction in pension eligibility requirements (so called “quota 100”) that entered into force in 2019. Indeed we find that retirement flows: i) started increasing already in 2019 and did not further accelerate afterwards; ii) increased the most in sectors such as public administration, whose workers – characterized by more stable careers – benefited more from the reform. We conclude that the majority of these retirements would have occurred irrespective of the pandemic.====). Moreover, we find that such contribution became more sizable in the first two quarters of 2020, while the unemployment gap turned negative due to the fall in labor supply, bringing headline unemployment figures below their natural level. Our augmented PC model implies that in 2020 total slack subtracted 0.4 percentage points to price and wage dynamics; according to an otherwise identical model not including the participation margin, such effect would have been almost nihil. The augmented model outperforms the standard one also from an ==== perspective: when computing inflation forecasts conditional on our measures of labor market slack, we confirm the importance of the participation gap, that widened in 2020 thus adding downward pressures on inflation.====To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to gauge the impact of the Covid crisis on ==== unemployment and participation rates, contributing to the recent literature on labor market dynamics during the pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Our approach, described more in detail in ====, builds on the large literature on the flow-based analysis of labor market dynamics (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, among others). More in general, our results are relevant for the literature proposing alternative labor market slack measures (====, ====, ====) or focusing on the impact of labor supply fluctuations on cyclical dynamics (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Moreover, our evidence that participation is cyclical is an important result also for other models in the literature, like for instance search and matching models, which usually assume that participation is fixed (few exceptions are ====, ====). In particular, our findings suggest that measuring labour market tightness only based on unemployment and assuming that labour supply is exogenous would bias the estimation of the matching function and of matching efficiency (as also pointed out by ====, ====), and that this bias varies along the cycle, therefore changing the interpretation of movements in the Beveridge curve, for instance. Finally, we contribute to the extensive literature on Phillips curve estimation (see ====, ====, ====, ==== for recent discussions), showing that the participation margin provides relevant and autonomous information on economic slack and contributes to explaining inflation dynamics.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== defines the concepts of ==== and ==== participation and unemployment rates. ==== and ==== respectively present and discuss estimates of the structural and natural rates. ==== concludes.",Slack and prices during Covid-19: Accounting for labor market participation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122000227,31 January 2022,2022,Research Article,119.0

No. 66, Chongshan Middle Road, Huanggu District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, China","Received 25 May 2021, Revised 23 January 2022, Accepted 25 January 2022, Available online 31 January 2022, Version of Record 4 February 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2022.102136,Cited by (5),Recent automation technology has lead to ,"The United States is often depicted as the “land of opportunity,” where people believe they can achieve success regardless of their social origins or family backgrounds. However, in striking contrast to this perception, the U.S. is currently one of the ==== intergenerationally mobile developed countries (Corak, 2013). According to Chetty et al. (2017b), the upward mobility, defined as the fraction of children earning more than their parents, decreased sharply for the cohorts born after 1940—from 90% for the 1940 cohort to 50% for the 1980 cohort.==== Also, upward mobility fell the most for middle-class children: being born to a middle-class family is no longer a guarantee of middle-class life for the children themselves. In other words, the bigger problem is not that the economy does not grow any longer, but rather the growth is not sufficiently shared among those who are from less advantaged families.====Contemporaneously, another even more notable trend is the so-called ==== (Autor, Dorn, 2013, Goos, Manning, 2007) in the U.S. since 1980, with the “hollowing out” of middle-skill jobs and expansion of both good and bad jobs in relative terms.==== The literature (e.g., Autor and Dorn (2013); Autor et al. (2003); Goos and Manning (2007); Goos et al. (2014)) hypothesizes and confirms with data that such job polarization is primarily driven by middle-skill-task-replacing automation technology.==== Because the tasks subject to recent technological substitution are typically routine or repetitive (Autor et al., 2003), this hypothesis is called ==== (henceforth RBTC, Goos et al. (2014)). According to Autor and Dorn (2013), RBTC has had nearly neutral effects on employment rate but changed the composition radically: numerous routine middle-skill jobs (e.g., production, operation, clerical and administrative jobs) have been replaced by non-tradable low-skill service jobs (e.g., retail, food delivery) for the employment of less-educated people.==== Compared with the former, service jobs typically pay less and provide fewer opportunities for career progression. A manufacturing job often helps a person without a college degree have a middle-class lifestyle, which is hardly the case for the majority of service jobs. In contrast, the more educated workers who perform non-routine cognitive tasks have improved their earnings, as recent automation technology tends to complement their skills.====This paper finds suggestive evidence that RBTC has contributed to the sharp decline in recent cohorts’ upward mobility. As addressed above, the literature has established that less educated people are becoming worse off in terms of their earnings because of RBTC, while the opposite is true for more educated people. It is not apparent ==== whether a child will be positively or negatively affected by RBTC upon her entry into the labour market, which depends on her skill or educational level. This paper primarily asks whether the effect of RBTC relates to one’s family background and finds supporting evidence. Compared with the existing literature, this paper also provides a novel perspective through which we can better understand RBTC’s labour market impacts: the relationship between family background and children’s educational attainment, and how this relationship is shaped by RBTC.====To motivate my empirical analyses, I extend (Becker et al., 2018) model and derive novel testable implications (Appendix A). According to my theory, whether a child will be positively or negatively affected by RBTC upon her entry into the labour market is uncertain and depends on her family background, among others. My model predicts heterogeneous effects of RBTC on mobility across the family income distribution. Specifically, RBTC makes disadvantaged children less likely to move upward and more likely to move downward while strengthening advantaged children’s advantage. This is because routine jobs serve as an alternative way to move upward if disadvantaged children cannot go to college and find a high-skilled job, which is often the case. As these jobs decline, it is harder for disadvantaged children to escape poverty.====By exploiting the geographic variation of historical industrial specialization patterns that determine local labour markets’ exposure to RBTC, my empirical results largely confirm these predictions: I find that a greater exposure to RBTC is robustly associated with a reduction in upward mobility, and an increase in downward mobility for children from almost all family backgrounds.Numerically, holding other things equal, the probability for children to move from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is 1.24% less likely for those living in areas with the exposure to RBTC at the 75th percentile than their counterparts in areas with the exposure at the 25th percentile. As a benchmark, the national average probability for such a movement is 7.5%. The basic idea is that RBTC leads to more skewed labour demand in terms of skill requirements and disproportionately rewards the high-skilled workers (e.g., college graduates). In contrast, RBTC makes less skilled ones (e.g., high school graduates) more likely to take jobs traditionally held by low-skilled workers. As a result, RBTC has made it harder for disadvantaged children to climb up the social ladder by finding a decent job. In theory, all children have the chance to benefit from RBTC if they manage to become high-skilled. Nevertheless, most disadvantaged children fail to do so because their families typically lack the necessary resources (money, parental human capital, etc.) to prepare them for high-skilled jobs (Bartik and Hershbein, 2018). Further, a follow-up decomposition practice shows that the exposure to RBTC is a quantitatively important explanatory variable for upward mobility among other relevant predictors identified in the literature.====On the other hand, regarding the “relative mobility,” which is a summary measure of both upward and downward mobility and often referred to as “mobility” in the literature, I find that it has nearly zero association with the exposure to RBTC. This seemingly null result likely reflects a mixture of opposite effects of RBTC at different segments across the family income distribution, providing a plausible explanation for the puzzle that relative mobility has stayed constant in recent decades despite the rapidly increasing inequality in the U.S. (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014, Lee, Solon, 2009). My analysis suggests that RBTC has decreased the upward mobility of the disadvantaged children (making the lower half more persistent) and increased the ==== mobility of more advantaged children (making the upper half less persistent). These two effects of RBTC on relative mobility work in the opposite direction and almost entirely cancel out each other.====In this paper, I also find suggestive evidence for 1. the negative relationship between the exposure to RBTC and upward mobility is primarily driven by males and much more moderate for females; 2. This relationship is concave in the exposure to RBTC; 3. This relationship is weakened by the presence of a large mining sector, but largely unaffected by the presence of a large agricultural sector; 4. RBTC has increased the college attendance rates for families with almost all income levels (thus leading to an “educational upgrading”); 5. RBTC has shortened the gap in attendance rates between high- and low-income families; 6. Nevertheless, RBTC has widened the gap in college ==== by family income. These results suggest that when exposed to RBTC, disadvantaged children are more ==== upward mobile in terms of college attendance, but this is not enough to offset the negative impacts RBTC has exerted through the labour market on their upward mobility in terms of income.====My results are robust under a series of sensitivity checks, which are presented in the appendix B. First, using Census data (1980–2000), I show suggestive evidence that RBTC has indeed led to an educational upgrading and widened the gap in children’s incomes by their family origins, consistent with my baseline results. More interestingly, I carry out a placebo test suggesting that the polarizing effect of RBTC on income was present in 1990 and 2000, but not in 1980, when RBTC was starting to take place. Finally, my results generally hold using alternative measures and specifications.====My paper makes at least three contributions: 1. Contribute to understanding the determinants of the considerable geographic variation in mobility within the U.S., identified by Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez (2014), and find suggestive evidence that RBTC has played a quantitatively important role. 2. Give a plausible explanation for the remarkable decline of upward mobility in the United States; 3. Help to understand the distributional effects of technology. Technology makes us better off collectively, but it may also make some of us worse off. While the relationship between technology and inequality has drawn much attention (e.g., Acemoglu (1998); Autor and Dorn (2013); Autor et al. (2003)), my paper adds to this literature from the intergenerational perspective.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The law affected firms with 10 or more workers and specified penalties by firm size, including a disclosure requirement for firms with 200 or more workers. We use matched employer-employee data to estimate worker-firm fixed-effects models, decomposing the firm’s contribution to the gender pay gap into bargaining power and sorting channels. The EPL reduces the firm premium gender gap by 6.1%, driven by the bargaining power channel. The effects are larger in firms exposed to higher penalties and disclosure requirements.","Many countries have witnessed stagnation in the narrowing of the gender pay gap in recent decades, contrasting with the rapid advances in the educational attainment and labor market experience of women (Albrecht, Björklund, Vroman, 2003, Bailey, 2006, Blau, Kahn, 2017, Bruns, 2019, Goldin, 2014). The recent literature has attempted to reconcile this conflicting evidence by studying the role of firm-specific premiums in the gender wage gap (Card et al., 2016) and its evolution over time (Bruns, 2019, Casarico, Lattanzio, 2019). Gender differentials in firm-specific premiums explain a sizable proportion of the gender pay gap and play a central role in explaining recent trends in wage inequality (Abowd, Kramarz, Margolis, 1999, Barth, Kerr, Olivetti, 2021, Card, Cardoso, Heining, Kline, 2018). Indeed, Bruns (2019) provided strong evidence for the role of firm pay premiums in the marked slowdown in gender convergence in Germany since the 1990s. These effects could be==== attributed to “changes in employers’ pay policies that have been detrimental to women.”====While the literature on firm-specific pay premiums provides novel insights into the evolution (or stagnation) of the gender pay gap, little is known about how public policy can affect these premiums. In this paper, we analyze the effect of Chile’s 2009 Equal Pay for Equal Work Law (EPL) on firm-specific wage premiums. We first assess firms’ contribution to the gender pay gap using matched employer-employee data from Chile for the 2005–2013 period. We estimate a wage model with two high-dimensional fixed effects following Abowd et al. (1999) (AKM, hereafter). This approach permits us to compute the firm-specific pay premium for males and females in connected firms (by workers’ mobility) and decompose them into sorting effects, i.e., the effect due to female workers sorting into low-paying firms, and bargaining power effects, i.e., the effect due to workers’ ability to extract firm rents when negotiating, following Card et al. (2016) (CCK, hereafter).====We then use CCK’s framework to assess the effect of Chile’s 2009 EPL on the contribution of firms to the gender wage gap (firm-specific gender pay gap). The law established equal remuneration for work of equal value in firms with 10 or more workers and monetary penalties that increase with firm size, as measured by the number of permanent workers. It also mandates firms with 200 or more workers to disclose information about their wage-setting and promotional procedures by providing a registry of all positions or functions in the company according to their essential technical skills (disclosure requirement). Thus, we estimate AKM models for male and female workers before and after the law, allowing us to implement a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to assess whether the law affected the firm-specific gender pay gap (captured by gender differences in firm fixed-effects). By implementing a simple reweighting scheme, we show that our DID results correspond to the effect of the EPL on the bargaining power effect. We also perform comparisons of sorting and bargaining power before and after the law using firms with fewer than 10 workers as a benchmark. Finally, we assess whether the law affected sorting patterns following an approach similar to that of Casarico and Lattanzio (2019). In particular, we estimate the effect of the law on the probability of moving to a firm in a higher/lower quartile of the pay premium distribution. We do so using a DID approach, using females as the treated group and males as the untreated group, before and after the law.====We find that firms explain approximately 39% of the gender pay gap, which averaged 25 log points in the analyzed period (2005–2013). Sorting effects account for approximately 32 to 36 pp (82-92%), and bargaining power effects account for 3 to 7 pp (8-18%). The EPL helps to reduce the gender pay gap explained by firms by 1.5 pp (6.1%). The reductions are larger in firms with 200 and more workers exposed to higher fines and the disclosure requirement, ranging between 1.9 and 2.5 pp (7.8–10.2% of the pay gap). We find that the effect of the law manifests through bargaining power only, with no impact on the sorting channel. We argue that the limited effect of the law is due to the reduced share of the bargaining power effect relative to the sorting effect of the firm’s total contribution to the pay gap.====Our paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, to assess the effects of an EPL on the firm-specific pay premium gap. The Chilean case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of an EPL on the contribution of firms to the gender gap. While many countries passed EPLs in the 1970s or earlier, when no matched employer-employee data existed, Chile passed its EPL in 2009, when this type of data was already available.==== Indeed, we have access to rich administrative matched employer-employee data from the Unemployment Insurance registry (UI), allowing us to construct a large monthly panel dataset with 60 million observations. Second, we can decompose the law’s impact on bargaining power and sorting channels using the framework of CCK. Third, our paper provides estimates of bargaining power and sorting effects in the context of a medium-income country with labor market institutions different from those of the developed world.====Our paper relates to three broad streams of the literature. First, our study contributes to the literature studying the role of firms in determining the pay gap. Using matched employer-employee data from Portugal, Card et al. (2016) showed that gender differentials in the firm-specific pay premium explain approximately 20% of the gender pay gap. As described above, they decomposed firms’ contribution to the gender gap into sorting and bargaining power effects, finding that sorting effects explain most of the gap (80%), with bargaining power explaining approximately one fifth.==== Our paper also relates to Barth et al. (2021), who analyzed workers’ movements within and across firms to measure shifts in the salaries of men and women over the lifecycle. They found that differential mobility between firms by gender could explain approximately 27% of the widening of the overall gender pay gap for college-educated workers.====Our paper also contributes to the literature on EPLs and their effects on the gender pay gap. Evidence on the effectiveness of EPLs remains scarce. Gunderson (1975) assessed the effect of equal pay legislation on male-female pay differentials using Canadian data. Using ordinary least squares (OLS), he found no significant effect of the law on Canada’s gender pay gap. Neumark and Stock (2006) studied the effects of sex and race discrimination laws on employment and earnings in the US. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach (DDD), they assessed how changes in employment and earnings differ among states that did and did not pass sex and race discrimination laws. They found a negative effect on employment and a negative short-term effect on earnings, “but with a growing positive effect over time that offsets this.”====Finally, since the EPL includes a disclosure requirement for large firms, our study relates to the literature on the effect of transparency laws on wage inequality. For example, Mas (2017) studied the effect of a transparency mandate in California that required all municipal salaries to be posted online. He found a 7% decline in average compensation of top managers and a 75% increase in their quit rate; these results are consistent with the hypothesis of aversion to excessive remuneration. Baker et al. (2019) examined a similar policy that disclosed the salaries of university faculties in Canada when they exceeded specified thresholds, finding a decrease in average salaries and a contraction of the gender wage gap.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Using data from the American Community Survey, we find that the ACA-DM reduced parents’ annual wages by about $2,600. However, the probability of employment and working hours only decreased marginally. The back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the magnitude of the estimated wage impact is similar to the increased insurance premium of a family plan due to the ACA-DM. These findings imply that a deadweight loss associated with the expansion of dependent health coverage is likely to be small as an increase in employers’ ==== is offset by a reduction in parents’ wages without significant reductions in labor inputs.","The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislated in March 2010 has been the largest healthcare reform in the United States since the introduction of Medicare in 1965. One of its key provisions was to extend dependent coverage up to children's 26th birthday. Before the ACA reform, children's healthcare coverage via their parents lapsed upon turning the age of 19; thus, about one-third of young adults aged 19–25 years were uninsured (Antwi et al., 2013). After implementing the ACA dependent coverage mandate (ACA-DM), the share of young adults aged 19–25 years with health insurance coverage increased from 64% to 73% between September 2010 and June 2011 (Sommers and Schwartz, 2011). This implies that about 2.5 million young adults newly gained health insurance coverage. Much of the increase came from their parents’ employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI) (Antwi et al., 2013).====A direct consequence of the ACA-DM for employers is an increase in labor costs, as they are required to provide additional dependent coverage for employees with children aged 19–25. In response to this burden, employers may reduce wages or labor inputs, such as the number of employees or work hours, which leads to a deadweight loss in the labor market. However, Summers’ (1989) seminal work on the incidence of ESHI implies that parents could accept lower wages in return for extended dependent coverage. If wages are fully adjusted to the employer's increased health insurance costs, employment or working hours will not decrease, and thus there will be no efficiency loss.====Given the large size of the young adult population who gained new health insurance coverage via the ACA-DM, it can be of great interest to policymakers and researchers to understand to what extent this reform has caused efficiency loss in labor markets due to the increase in labor costs. Since existing studies mainly focused on the labor market impacts of workers’ ==== benefits, there is little direct evidence on the labor market impacts of workers’ ==== benefits. To answer these questions, this study investigates how the ACA-DM affected labor market outcomes of parents with children aged 19–25 years, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS). For the identification, we compare changes in the labor market outcomes of parents with eligible young adults (aged 19–25 years) before and after implementing the ACA-DM with those of parents with non-eligible young adults (aged 17–18 years and 26–28 years) using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach.====The DID analysis results show that the ACA-DM reduced the annual wages of parents with children aged 19–25 years by $2636, about 4% of the average wage during the pre-reform period. The estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. By contrast, the ACA-DM marginally decreased the probability of employment by 0.4 percentage points, weekly working hours by 0.48 hour, and the probability of full-time work by 0.1 percentage points. Compared with the pre-reform averages, the estimates of labor inputs are small in magnitude, although the estimate of the employment probability is statistically significant at the 5% level. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the reduced wage amount is almost equivalent to the increased insurance premium of a family plan due to the ACA-DM, implying a full shift of the additional cost of expanded dependent coverage to workers. The results are robust to various alternative specifications. Our findings suggest that the extended provision of dependent health coverage to children aged 19–25 years via the ACA reform did not cause any significant deadweight loss in the labor market for parents with young adult children.====This study contributes to the literature by investigating the impact of dependent health coverage on labor market outcomes. Several empirical studies examining the labor market impact of workers’ ==== health benefits document that mandated health benefits decrease workers’ wages with ambiguous impacts on labor inputs depending on workers’ valuation of health benefits (Baicker and Chandra, 2006; Gruber, 1994; Gruber and Kreuger, 1991; Kolstad and Kowalski, 2016; Lahey, 2012). While this literature provides important insights into the role of health benefits in the labor market, these findings cannot be directly applied to understand the labor market impacts of dependent health benefits. For example, workers’ demand for dependent coverage can be lower than that of their own coverage, particularly when dependent children are healthy (e.g., young adults aged 19–25 years). Alternatively, parents might demand children's health insurance coverage regardless of their children's health, because dependent health coverage can provide peace of mind to working parents when they know that their young adult children have access to health insurance through their employment (Kim and Koh, 2022). We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on the impact of dependent health coverage for children on parents’ labor market outcomes.====Additionally, this study contributes to the scant literature on the labor market impact of the ACA-DM (Antwi et al., 2013, Barbaresco et al., 2015, Busch et al., 2014, Chua and Sommers, 2014; Goda et al., 2016; Kim, 2016; Yörük and Xu, 2019). While the literature mainly focuses on young adults’ labor market outcomes, Goda et al. (2016) is closest to our work in that they also examined the earnings of workers with children eligible for extended dependent coverage under the ACA-DM. Using data from the Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP) 2008 panel, the authors compared changes in labor market outcomes between states with and without pre-existing dependent coverage mandates before the ACA for the identification, and found no evidence that the ACA-DM reduced the earnings of parents with eligible young adults. We argue that the difference between our results and theirs is likely driven by differences in the empirical strategy. The underlying assumption of Goda et al. (2016) is that the effects of the ACA-DM on young adults’ health insurance coverage would be greater in states without pre-existing dependent coverage mandates. However, Antwi et al. (2013) showed that it was difficult for young adults to satisfy the requirements of state-level mandates prior to the ACA. As a result, the authors found little heterogeneity in the health insurance coverage impacts of ACA-DM between the two groups of states. This lack of the first-stage effect can explain the lack of evidence of wage reduction among parents with eligible young adults in Goda et al. (2016).==== Moreover, the parallel trend assumption between states with pre-existing dependent coverage mandates and states without those mandates is likely to be violated if any lagged effects of an existing dependent coverage mandate subsided by the time the ACA was enacted. Goda et al. (2016), however, did not show evidence that would allow readers to judge the validity of the parallel trend assumption. We provide novel evidence on how ACA-DM affects parents’ labor market outcomes by overcoming the above-stated limitations.====Finally, this study contributes to the literature by estimating the degree of the pass-through of employers’ costs for employees. Several studies have investigated the labor market impacts of employers’ cost burden and reported widely mixed results from zero to full incidence on workers, contrary toSummers’(1989) clear theoretical prediction.==== Recently, a few studies have focused on heterogeneity in labor market institutions to reconcile the mixed results of the pass-through rate (Kim et al., 2021, Bozio et al., 2020; Saez et al., 2019). Saez et al. (2019) shows that pay fairness norms could explain why the wage response to payroll taxation deviates from the prediction of the canonical labor market model. Bozio et al. (2020) and (Kim et al., 2021) investigate the roles of tax-benefit linkage and labor market competitiveness, respectively, to explain variations in the pass-through rate of payroll taxes. Our study provides consistent evidence with the findings of Bozio et al. (2020) and (Kim et al., 2021) that the pass-through rate is likely to be higher in a competitive labor market with a salient tax-benefit linkage.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Proponents argue that parental leave programs can reduce gender gaps in the labor market and promote children’s well-being. In this paper, I show that lengthy leaves can instead work against these intended goals. Using a ====, I find that a 3-year expansion of paid leave in France increases household specialization by inducing mothers to exit the labor force and fathers to raise their work hours. The leave further harms children’s verbal development.","Most countries currently provide new parents with some form of paid leave. Parental leave programs aim to decrease the gender gap in the labor market, promote couple stability and fertility, and support children’s development. These claims formed the basis of expansions in the duration of benefits over the past years. Indeed, numerous countries now provide at least one year of paid leave.==== By 2008, many governments, such as Austria, Norway and Sweden, also offered benefits for periods varying between 1.5 to 2 years, with others such as Finland, France, Germany and Spain, even extending the duration of leave to more than 3 years (Ruhm, 2011).====As further discussed below, an extensive body of literature documents that leaves that are shorter than one year typically have either positive or insignificant impacts on a range of family outcomes. However, critics argue that in contrast to their intended goals, longer periods of benefits can have undesirable effects. This claim is supported by mounting evidence that prolonged time off from work hurts women’s careers by decreasing their labor supply and earnings (Rossin-Slater, 2018). Nonetheless, it is still not well understood how extended periods of leave affect other aspects of household behavior and child development. Answering this question is of critical importance for countries that are currently expanding the duration of benefits. It is also informative for governments that already provide lengthy periods of benefits and that are considering decreasing the duration of leave. For example, in 2008, the Czech Republic reduced the length of leave from 4 to 2 years.====The scarcity of evidence on this topic is mainly attributed to difficulties in identifying causal effects. Specifically, a major challenge is overcoming selection bias arising from the fact that taking long periods of leave is likely correlated with unobservable factors such as socioeconomic background, that may also affect outcomes of interest. In this paper, I exploit a unique extension of benefits in France—of approximately 3 years—to examine how ==== periods of paid leave impact parents’ labor market behavior and children’s development.====My analysis focuses on a French parental leave program, which offered either one or both parents a flat-rate monthly cash allowance to take up to 3 years of time off from work after the birth of their child. During this time, a parent had to either work part-time or be out of the labor force, and the latter option provided a higher amount of benefits. To identify causal effects, I leverage a change in this program’s eligibility conditions. Initially, only parents of three children and more qualified for the leave. On July 25, 1994, benefits were extended to parents whose second child was born on or after July 1, 1994. Second-borns’ parents were also eligible for up to 3 years of job-protected unpaid leave both before and after the reform. Hence, the reform effectively increased parents’ access to cash benefits for up to 3 years without changing the length of job-protection. Since the reform was announced after the cutoff date of July 1, 1994, parents had little opportunity to manipulate the date of birth of their second child in order to become eligible for the leave. I therefore overcome selection into leave-taking by using a regression discontinuity design that compares households on either side of the date of birth cutoff. The main assumption in this design is that households that are barely eligible due to the second child’s date of birth, are similar to those that are barely ineligible.====I first document an increase in intra-household specialization in the years couples are eligible to receive the leave. Barely eligible women are around 23 percentage points more likely to be out of the labor force compared to those who are barely ineligible, suggesting that mothers are taking the maximum amount of benefits. Although the program is gender-neutral, men do not take up benefits, as they do not alter their labor force participation or part-time work decisions. The reform however induces fathers to work for an additional 2.8 hours per week. Since beneficiaries receive a fixed amount of cash benefits—and are thus unlikely to get full earnings replacement—this finding could imply that fathers are compensating for a loss of household income due to mothers taking the leave. The reform’s effects on parents’ do not persist after eligibility for leave benefits expires (i.e., in the fifth through seventh years after childbirth).====Increased household specialization has important consequences. Recent studies show that the divergence in men and women’s labor supply and earnings after parenthood persists in the long run (Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016, Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010), and that it explains most of the remaining gender gap in the labor market (Kleven et al., 2019). My results thus suggest that lengthy leaves can exacerbate gender differences in the labor market. While I can only test for leave-induced specialization for up to seven years after childbirth, the French reform was shown to have negative effects on women’s wages for up to 10 years after childbirth (Lequien, 2012). Another potential consequence of specialization is a reinforcement of traditional social norms regarding couples’ division of labor.====I also find that offering a long period of leave is detrimental to children’s development. Results indicate that compared to children born just before the cutoff, those born just after are between 3.1 and 5.6 percentage points more likely to have below-normal scores on various tests that assess their verbal skills at ages 5 to 6. Given that mothers likely become the primary caregivers for 3 years as a result of the reform, a potential explanation for these adverse effects is that maternal care is replacing higher quality childcare arrangements. Spending more time in their mothers’ care could also decrease the amount of time that children spend with other adults and children. The adverse effects can thus be driven by reduced social interactions, since interacting with other individuals is typically beneficial for children’s development (Dustmann and Schönberg, 2012). As discussed in Section 6.3, other channels that could explain the main results are reduced time spent with fathers, a potential loss of household income and the fact that the reform affected second-born children.====In summary, I show that providing a long period of paid leave reinforces a traditional division of labor within the household and has a detrimental impact on children’s verbal skills. By doing so, this paper makes several contributions to the existing literature. First, to the best of my knowledge, this paper provides some of the first evidence that a single extension in leave benefits can work against several of these programs’ intended goals. Parental leaves are typically designed to decrease the gender gap in the labor market and promote child well-being. Instead, I show that long periods of benefits can have the opposite effect on all these outcomes.====Prior evidence on how lengthy periods of leave affect household behavior and child development is relatively scarce. Most previous work looks at leaves that are shorter than one year (see Rossin-Slater, 2018). Studies on longer periods of leave mainly focus on their impacts on women’s labor market opportunities. For example, several previous studies document that the French reform induces women to exit the labor market and that they incur a wage penalty after returning to work (Lequien, 2012, Pailhé, Solaz, 2006, Piketty, 2005).==== However, these studies are different than mine as they do not examine fathers’ response or children’s outcomes. The few papers that provide more comprehensive evaluations of extended periods of leaves yield results that are significantly different than mine, as they report positive or no effects on fertility, marriage and child outcomes (Danzer, Halla, Schneeweis, Zweimüller, 2017, Danzer, Lavy, 2017, Ginja, Jans, Karimi, 2020, Lalive, Schlosser, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2014, Lalive, Zweimüller, 2009). While these settings diverge from mine along several dimensions, one potential reason for why my findings are different is that the French reform provides access to up to three years of paid leave. Compared to the rest of the literature, this is the largest one-time expansion in the duration of parental leave benefits. This is important given that many countries have recently increased the length of paid leaves.====Second, this paper adds to the literature by showing that leave programs can increase household specialization, through inducing fathers to raise their work hours. While previous studies show that leaves can reduce women’s labor supply, less is known about men’s response to these programs. Most of the literature concerning fathers examines how their leave-taking affects subsequent labor market responses and division of housework. A key difference in my study is that fathers do not increase or alter their leave take-up. I therefore document that mothers’ leave-taking affects men’s labor supply, even if fathers do not take up leave.====Finally, this study builds on a large body of literature which investigates the relation between leave programs and children’s outcomes. Studies looking at the introduction of paid and unpaid leaves find positive effects on children’s health and long-term education and earnings (Carneiro, Løken, Salvanes, 2015, Rossin, 2011, Stearns, 2015). However, subsequent expansions in coverage—for up to one year—have no impact on short-term health, cognitive development or long-run education (Baker, Milligan, 2008, Baker, Milligan, 2010, Baker, Milligan, 2015, Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, Salvanes, 2016, Liu, Skans, 2010, Rasmussen, 2010). My finding that children are adversely affected contrasts with most of the previous literature on parental leaves. One exception is the study by Dustmann and Schönberg (2012), which documents a small negative effect on children’s educational achievement at age 14 following an increase in the length of unpaid leave from 18 to 36 months in Germany. I complement their results by showing that larger extensions in the duration of paid leave can also hinder child development.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides detailed information on the institutional setting. Sections 3 and 4 respectively present the data and identification strategy. Sections 5 and 6 show the results and robustness checks.

I exploit this eligibility cutoff in a difference-in-discontinuities design and find that the probability of part-time employment increases relative to full-time employment. These employment transitions are strongest among females, low-educated workers, and individuals aged 45–64. An exploration of potential mechanisms shows that employment transitions are due to personal (voluntary) reasons as opposed to economic (involuntary) reasons, suggesting that increases in part-time employment are through the labor supply channel.","The Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in March 2010, enacted major provisions targeting the uninsured population in the United States. To increase access to public health insurance among low-income adults, the ACA proposed a nationwide expansion of Medicaid income eligibility limits to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled out the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to be an obligation for states with a 7 to 2 majority decision in ====, in turn resulting in one-third of the states not expanding coverage to the poor. Although not all states participated in the program, the ACA has increased Medicaid coverage among newly eligible and previously eligible adults (Frean, Gruber, Sommers, 2017, Aslim, Mungan, Navarro, Yu, 2020).====The availability of public health insurance can influence the costs associated with non-portability of employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI). In 2017, 56% of the population secured health coverage through an ESHI plan (Berchick et al., 2018).==== The potential loss of health coverage can limit workers to devote resources toward finding a better employer match as well as alternative activities that contribute to the welfare of individuals. This is an important concern for productivity and, hence, economic growth if workers pursue a job primarily to secure health coverage, a phenomenon referred to as “job lock” (Madrian, 1994). General equilibrium models that account for worker and firm heterogeneity in labor markets suggest a sizable shift from full-time to part-time jobs under the ACA (Nakajima and Tuzemen, 2016).====The equilibrium models provide certain economic channels through which the ACA affects labor market outcomes. A worker’s characteristics such as age, preference for leisure, medical expenditures, and productivity contribute to the decisions for transitioning from one employment state (e.g., full-time work with health insurance) to another (e.g., part-time work with no health insurance). Moreover, age can impact both the average productivity and medical expenditures, and hence the consumption, of a worker. The objective of a worker is to maximize the utility obtained from employment transitions conditional on the health insurance decision.==== These models yield two important insights regarding the labor market. First of all, prime age and near-elderly workers with high disutility of labor transition into part-time employment under the ACA. For that reason, part-time employment is concentrated mainly among prime age and near-elderly workers rather than young workers.==== There is also empirical evidence that some of these old workers exit the labor force under the ACA (see, e.g., Duggan et al., 2020). Second, decomposing different policy features of the ACA theoretically predicts that the Medicaid expansions and health insurance subsidies contribute substantially to the increase in part-time employment, suggesting that the main channel through which the ACA affects employment transitions is the labor supply channel. It is particularly critical to test these predictions empirically and explore whether shifts from full-time to part-time work exist in data following the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.====This paper provides a novel approach to investigate potential employment transitions resulting from the expansion of public health coverage to low-income adults under the ACA. The main group of interest is adults without dependent children (“childless adults”) since they had limited access to Medicaid coverage prior to the ACA.==== I exploit the changes in Medicaid eligibility for childless adults near the income eligibility cutoff of 138% FPL. Specifically, I employ a regression discontinuity design that compares Medicaid coverage and labor market outcomes for childless adults who are slightly below the eligibility cutoff to the outcomes for childless adults who are slightly above the eligibility cutoff.====To isolate the effect of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion from other time-invariant attributes of states, I combine the RD analysis with the difference-in-differences (DD) method, coined as “difference-in-discontinuities.” To my knowledge, this is the first study to use this approach to investigate the employment effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.==== Furthermore, I construct an eligibility measure using two data sets, the March CPS and the monthly CPS, wherein the former has information on household income and health insurance status and the latter includes labor market outcomes for each month.==== To mitigate the effects of behavioral adjustments (via changes in employment status) to achieve eligibility, I restrict the sample to pre-expansion years. I conduct a series of data-driven tests on the running variable to confirm that there is no statistically significant bunching near the eligibility cutoff. Finally, I provide first stage estimates on Medicaid coverage and run event study specifications that do not depend on eligibility assignment to address issues related to a potential measurement error in the running variable.====I find that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion has increased Medicaid coverage at the eligibility cutoff in expansion states. There is no evidence that childless adults move out of the labor force or transition into unemployment after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. I find evidence of employment transitions from full-time to part-time employment in expansion states after the policy change. Specifically, I show that the transitions are salient for jobs with less than 20 working hours. Further, I find the transitions to be stronger and statistically significant among females, low-educated adults, and individuals aged 45–64. Falsification checks show no coverage and employment effects in non-expansion states. These estimates are robust to the inclusion of early expansion states, increasing bandwidths, and varying functional forms of the running variable.====More broadly, this paper contributes to two bodies of literature in health economics and labor economics that study labor supply responses to welfare programs, particularly the Medicaid program. There are mixed findings in the literature on the employment effects of public health insurance, especially in the context of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Exploiting the variation in states’ expansion decision under the ACA, Gooptu et al. (2016), Kaestner et al. (2017), and Leung and Mas (2018) find little to no effect on employment. Relating to the earlier work, Duggan et al. (2019) indicate that work disincentives created in areas with higher potential exchange enrollment offset the employment effects in areas with higher potential Medicaid enrollment.====This study relates to work by Dague et al. (2017) and Kim (2016) that find a statistically significant reduction in employment in Wisconsin and Connecticut, respectively, resulting from the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. Moreover, there is evidence that contractions of eligibility increase employment (Garthwaite et al., 2014). The empirical design in this study not only allows me to explore the changes in outcomes separately in expansion and non-expansion states, but provides tools to assess the validity of the estimates by testing for discontinuous breaks that may be due to changes in labor demand rather than labor supply. I provide evidence to rule out a plausible demand side mechanism that increases part-time employment. This is an important contribution to the literature since I am not aware of any other studies exploring employment transitions along these dimensions, particularly in the context of Medicaid expansions.====Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on early retirement. Aslim (2019) and Wood (2019) find the employment effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions to be salient among adults aged 55–64. These findings suggest that the expansion of public coverage increases the probability of early retirement.==== Prior studies focusing on aggregate effects - not restricting the sample to workers who are likely affected by the policy changes under the ACA - might not have enough power to identify statistically meaningful changes in part-time employment. In this paper, I emphasize the importance of assessing the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion across different populations, including various subgroups near the eligibility cutoff, with heterogeneous labor supply responses.====In what follows, Section 2 introduces the data, sample, and variables.

At both the occupation and individual level, we do find a decline since 1973 in the share of workers earning middle wages. However, the large increase in the share of high-paid workers is not accompanied by any substantial increase in the share of low-paid workers—inconsistent with employment polarization. In particular, we find that the share of employment in low-wage occupations did not increase during the 1990s, and that the apparent growth (and therefore polarization) found in the previous literature is an artefact of occupation code redefinitions.

We employ an ==== approach to address the former and accounted for self-selection by exploiting the variation in linguistic diversity across cohorts within kindergartens. The estimated causal effects of linguistic diversity are heterogeneous: There is a small negative but statistically significant effect on the development of German children, which is mainly driven by a detrimental effect on the language skills of German speakers, but there is no effect on non-German speakers.","The 2012 German SVR-migration survey revealed that parental assessment of schools with a high percentage of immigrant children was poor and that parents were reluctant to enroll their children in such schools. This assessment is shared by the immigrant population; immigrants in Germany are also less willing to send their children to a school with high ethnolinguistic diversity (SVR-migration, 2012). As a result, in ethnically diverse neighborhoods, families, particularly those with a strong educational background, opt out of the assigned or the closest school because they fear it will disadvantage their children. If policy makers want to address the segregation and resulting disadvantages for children from immigrant families, they need a better understanding of the effects of ethnolinguistic diversity on the development of children. Policy makers need to know whether it is the heterogeneity of the group or the quality of the schools that needs improvement. If the ethnic composition does not explain lower educational achievement, the focus should be on school quality. For example, needs-based funding schemes could be a suitable policy option. If, however, the ethnic composition of schools causes lower educational achievement, then school assignment policy ought to be addressed as well. This study contributes to the discussion by exploring the causal effects of ethnic composition, measured by linguistic diversity, in early education.====Although several studies have shown the importance of early education for early-life skills, lifetime educational attainment, earnings, and the probability of employment (see Almond and Currie, 2011, Elango et al., 2016, and Almond et al., 2018, for detailed reviews of the literature), little is known about peer effects in early education on child development. In particular, the effects of linguistic diversity need more research, as this diversity has been growing in preschools, in recent decades, along with the increase in immigration flows. Immigrants choose whether to speak to their children in their mother tongue or in the language of the host country, and a rise in the number of children who do not speak the language of the host country at home increases linguistic diversity in preschools. This diversity may influence early educational attainment, for instance, through social interaction, teaching quality, creativity stimulation, and cultural assimilation.====We investigate the effects of linguistic diversity in kindergartens on child development, using administrative records from the school entrance examinations (SEE) of four cohorts for a city in Germany.==== The SEE is a compulsory examination to assess health status and school readiness of all children at ages five to six (Makles and Schneider, 2017; Cornelissen et al., 2018; Felfe and Lalive, 2018). SEE contains a wide range of cognitive measures, including language skills, counting, and quantity comparison, in addition to measures of visual and motor skills and selective attention, from which we construct one indicator for child development.====The SEE data also allows us to identify the language spoken at home, defined as the language to which the child was exposed during early development, and to compute the share of non-German speakers in the kindergarten-cohort. Yet the share, the conventional measure of immigrant concentration in the literature (e.g., Bossavie, 2020; Frattini and Meschi, 2019), does not capture the extent of dissimilarity within immigrants and between immigrants and natives. We, therefore, also construct a measure of linguistic diversity that indicates the expected linguistic distance between two randomly selected children from a kindergarten-cohort. This allows us to explore whether linguistic diversity and also the extent of linguistic diversity are potential channels underlying the impact of immigrant concentration on educational outcomes of immigrants and natives.====Parental choice of the language spoken at home and parental choice of kindergarten determine linguistic diversity in kindergartens. At the same time, the expected diversity in kindergartens might also affect the parental choice of language spoken at home. These parental choices leave us with two main challenges in identifying the effects of linguistic diversity. The first challenge is the selection problem that has been widely discussed in the peer effects literature (Manski, 1993; Epple and Romano, 2011; Angrist, 2014). Children are selected into kindergartens based on their parental residential choices and parental educational preferences (Black, 1999; Hoxby, 2000). Kindergarten composition is, therefore, associated with neighborhood characteristics and socioeconomic background of children.====We overcome the selection problem by including cohort and kindergarten fixed effects and exploiting the variation in linguistic diversity across cohorts within kindergartens. Intuitively, we examine whether children in cohorts with low linguistic diversity outperform children in the same kindergarten in cohorts with higher linguistic diversity. The identifying assumption is that the within kindergarten variation in linguistic diversity across cohorts is uncorrelated with other determinants of child development. To provide support for this assumption, we show that the variation in observed individual characteristics across cohorts and within kindergartens does not significantly differ across low and high linguistically diversified kindergartens.====The second challenge arises because the parental choice of language spoken at home might be affected by the parental expectation of linguistic diversity in kindergarten. Therefore, even after accounting for non-random sorting due to parental kindergarten choice, the effect of linguistic diversity on early child development could not be given a causal interpretation because of the potential endogeneity of language spoken at home. Children of native-born parents arguably speak German at home, regardless of the languages spoken by their peers. Immigrant parents, however, decide on the language spoken at home, possibly depending on the need and propensity to integrate.==== In fact, we find evidence that children with at least one foreign-born parent are more likely to speak German at home if they attend a kindergarten with low linguistic diversity.====To deal with the endogeneity of language spoken at home, we exploit an instrumental variable approach to identify arguably exogenous variation in kindergarten-cohort linguistic diversity. In designing the instrument, we draw on a recent and growing literature on social interactions among individuals in partially overlapping peer groups (Bramoulle et al., 2009; De Giorgi et al., 2010; Ahn and Trogdon, 2017; Nicoletti et al., 2018). We assume that children interact with their kindergarten-cohort peers and, at the same time, with their residential neighbors. We also assume that children do not interact with their kindergarten-cohort peers’ residential neighbors who do ==== attend the same kindergarten. This implies that a child's residential neighbors, who do not attend the same kindergarten as the child, affect the child's kindergarten-cohort peers only through affecting that child. We, thus, use the average linguistic diversity among those neighbors who attend other kindergartens to instrument linguistic diversity in the kindergarten-cohort. To support the assumption of the exogeneity of the instrument, we provide evidence that the decision of non-German-born parents to speak German with their child at home is uncorrelated with our instrument.====To study the effect of linguistic diversity on our indicator of child development, we begin with an OLS model without fixed effects. We document a negative correlation between the concentration of non-German speakers and child development, no matter whether we use the share on non-German speakers or linguistic diversity to measure the concentration. In the next step, when we include cohort and kindergarten fixed effects to account for self-selection, the correlation goes down to zero and becomes insignificant. Our findings hence suggest that the negative correlation in the model without fixed effects reflects parental preferences and other unobserved socioeconomic characteristics which affect their choices of kindergarten. This result is consistent with the findings of Geay, McNally, and Telhaj (2013). They show that, when they only control for student demographics, the proportion of non-native speakers, defined as students who spoke a non-English language during early development, is negatively associated with the schooling achievement of native speakers in primary schools in England. (Geay, McNally, and Telhaj (2013)) then include various controls and school fixed effects and show that an increase in the share of non-native speakers has no impact on schooling achievement in fixed-effects models.====In a final step, we address the endogeneity of language spoken at home by using our instrumental variables approach. It turns out that, even after overcoming the endogeneity issue, the concentration of non-German speakers has no significant effect on our main measure of child development. However, when we estimate the effect of linguistic diversity on different measures of cognitive ability, our results reveal that the share of non-German speakers and linguistic diversity both adversely affect German language skills. The effects are, however, modest. Compared to an average score of 75% in the item “correct use of preposition” and of 78.9% in the item “forming plurals,” a one standard deviation increase in the share of non-German speakers decreases a child's score in the former by 1.8 percentage points and in the latter by 2.6 percentage points. The sizes of these effects are similar when we use our index of linguistic diversity. This suggests that the linguistic proximity of foreign languages to German does not explain the underlying impacts of immigrant concentration better than the share of non-German-speaking children.====To better assess the peer effects and provide insights into how to design policy, we shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effects (Lazear, 2001). Non-German-speaking children with a low level of German proficiency need more attention from kindergarten educators, thus reducing teaching quality for German-speaking children. And besides, German speakers do not benefit in language skills from their non-German-speaking peers who experience linguistic difficulties. Therefore, an increase in the number of non-German speakers may interfere with the German speakers’ learning process, but not with non-German speakers’. We provide evidence on this mechanism by estimating the effects within subgroups of German and non-German speakers. Our results support the hypothesis. The share of non-German speakers has a negative impact on the achievements of German speakers, but it does not have any effect on non-German speakers. Our findings show that a one standard deviation increase in the share of non-German speakers decreases German speakers’ scores in the correct use of prepositions by 17.7% of a standard deviation and in forming plurals by 13.5% of a standard deviation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Taste-based discrimination mechanisms appear to be significant as well, but small in size.","Gender wage gaps are one of the most persistent economic regularities, on which many hypotheses have been formulated and, at least since the seminal work by Oaxaca (1973), many regression approaches have been proposed.==== In this paper we combine elements of several of the existing theories, building a model where differences between men and women are determined by three main factors: ==== (or so-called taste-based) and ==== (or so-called monopsonistic) discrimination, as well as gender differences in compensating wage differentials. Based on this theoretical framework, we develop empirical strategies that allow to test for the presence of these firm-level mechanisms driving the gender pay gap.====According to the theory of Becker (1957), taste-based discrimination arises because some employers have a dis-utility in working with women, so that either they are able to pay them less than their productivity, or they avoid hiring them, reducing the aggregate female labour demand. As a consequence, firms where discriminatory preferences are small enough can employ a given quantity of female workers at a lower wage than the one needed to hire the same quantity of men. Instead, ==== discrimination is a mechanism arising when firms have monopsonistic power in the labour market. If the assumption of price taking behaviour is relaxed, employers minimize costs not only by adjusting quantities, but also by adjusting wages. In this context, according to the ==== discrimination hypothesis, gender wage differences are driven by employers’ greater monopsonistic wage-setting power against women, provided that, on average, the female labour supply to the firm is more rigid than the male one.====Studying the impact of taste-based discrimination in the context of monopsonistic labour markets is an interesting choice for several reasons. First, from a theoretical perspective the two discriminatory mechanisms (employers’ preferences and wage setting power) should not be considered as mutually exclusive. On this respect, Black (1995) and Flabbi (2010) build dynamic models where taste-based discrimination itself produces monopsonistic discrimination against minority groups, showing that one of the two factors may even strengthen the other. Secondly, several studies, using different approaches in a variety of contexts, have documented the presence of some degree of employers’ wage setting power and of substantial differences in the female and male labour supply elasticities to the firm.==== Also from a more theoretical perspective, Boal and Ransom (1997) show that a monopsony is implied by standard dynamic search models in which larger firms face dis-economies of scale in hiring workers.====In this paper we show that a model of taste-based discrimination in which employers can set wages, employment levels, and gender-specific non-wage amenities provides interesting insights on the nature of sex differences in ====. Such policies represent pay heterogeneity across employers conditional on workforce composition, and substantial gender differences in this wage component have been documented for several countries by a recent and growing literature (see in particular Bruns, 2019, Card, Cardoso, Kline, 2016, Casarico, Lattanzio, 2019, Coudin, Maillard, Tô, 2018, Morchio, Moser, 2019, Sin, Stillman, Fabling, 2020). In our theoretical framework we show that, if tastes against women arise in the context of an imperfect labour market, even highly discriminatory employers hire female workers, but they offer them lower wages to compensate for the dis-utility associated to working with them. This outcome is different from the predictions of the original Becker’s model, according to which all employers below a marginal level of discrimination prefer hiring women, while those above this threshold avoid employing them.====Given that in our theoretical model firms pay women below the monopsonistic benchmark more the stronger their prejudices, we show that workplaces’ compensation policies estimated through AKM regressions Abowd et al. (1999) embed taste-based discrimination. We also discuss the role of monopsonistic discrimination and of gender differences in compensating wage differentials as additional components of the gender wage gap in firms’ wage policies, deriving empirical tests for the presence of these mechanisms. In particular, we test three main hypothesis on the determinants of gender differences in firms’ pay policies. First, we evaluate the importance employers’ monopsonistic discrimination, relying on the fact that firms belonging to the same labour market, defined in terms of geographic- industry- and firm-size proximity, should face similar opportunities of marking down female wages more than male pay levels. Then, we test for the presence of taste-based discrimination and gender differences in compensating wage differentials using proxy variables for these two phenomena within a theoretically grounded regression framework. We approximate preferences against women adopting two commonly used measures, i.e. the presence of women at the top of the occupational hierarchy and the female employment share.==== When testing for the presence of gender differences in compensating wage differentials, we focus on the role of flexible working schedules and use the availability of part-time work as proxy for work environments potentially preferred by women.====The application of this paper is based on data covering the population of private sector workers in the Veneto region of Italy. We focus the analysis on manufacturing ==== only, since these can be considered groups of firms characterized by relatively homogeneous labour market structures.==== First, we show that the gender gap in AKM firms’ pay policies induces a large variability in the total gender wage gap. Firms where such pay premia are relatively less favourable for women are associated to substantial female wage penalties. Conditioning on observable characteristics, gender differences in returns to such characteristics, firm and worker fixed effects, the gender wage gap grows by up to 36% when moving from the bottom 20% to the top 20% of firms that pay relatively lower wage premia to women. Moreover, controlling for narrowly defined local labor market effects reduces this variability in the conditional gender wage gap by around one third. These results suggest that monopsonistic discrimination mechanisms are potentially relevant, but they also show that most of the variability in the conditional gender wage gap across firms occurs within narrowly defined labour markets, rather than across them.====Using a different regression approach we find that taste based-discrimination and gender differences in preferences for flexibility provide a small, but significant contribution to the firm-level gender wage gap. In particular a 10 percentage points increase in the female employment share within firms implies between 0.2 and 0.9 percentage points reduction in the pay gap, conditioning on workers’ productivity and monopsonistic discrimination effects. The presence of women at the top of the corporate hierarchy, while determining around one percentage point increase in overall conditional gender wage differences, has no significant effects on the conditional level of female wages at the bottom of the firms’ structure, a result consistent with the findings by Flabbi et al. (2019).====We also find that women earn relatively less at firms that offer more flexible working schedules. In particular, we document up to more than one percentage point growth in the gender wage gap conditional on employers’ wage setting power and workers’ productivity for each 10 percentage points increase in the share of total days worked part-time within firms. Thus, flexibility in working schedules appears to be a job characteristic preferred by women, which allows employers to reduce the female wage rate with respect to male pay levels.====Being able to distinguish among the sources of wage differences between men and women is not merely a theoretical exercise, but it has important implications on the choice of the most effective policies to implement in order to achieve greater equality. The approach developed in this paper can be helpful when testing the implications of Becker’s theory in the data. Most of the existing contributions in this area face the challenge of finding a reliable firm-specific parameter for discriminatory preferences. Indeed, such information is sometimes explicitly available from surveys only at an aggregate level or in particular contexts (as for example in Charles, Guryan, 2008, Glover, Pallais, Pariente, 2017). More often, discriminatory preferences are approximated by the female share of workers within firms (e.g. Weber and Zulehner, 2014) and by the presence of women in executive boards or in the management (e.g. Cardoso, Winter-Ebmer, 2010, Flabbi, Macis, Moro, Schivardi, 2019, Gagliarducci, Paserman, 2015). Our contribution to this literature is to provide an empirical test on the relevance of these firm-level measures of taste-based discrimination, which is grounded on both, theoretical and empirical considerations.====The paper is organized as follows.

Our RCT varied whether freelancers were only paid a pure sales commission or a lower commission combined with a fixed payment per order to provide insurance against income fluctuations. We do not find evidence for effect heterogeneity with respect to risk aversion, but sizeable heterogeneity with respect to intrinsic motivation: While – in line with standard theory – the treatment reduced performance for less intrinsically motivated workers, it increased performance among workers with a high task motivation.","The importance of freelance work has been growing. In a survey for the US, Katz and Krueger (2019) find that the fraction of workers in alternative work arrangements rose from 10.7 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015. Part of this increase can be ascribed to the rise of the gig economy: a growing share of freelance suppliers of work are matched to customers on online platforms (Kuhn and Maleki (2017)). Tracking the number of open projects and tasks posted on a sample of such platforms, Kässi and Lehdonvirta (2018) document that the demand for online gig work has grown by about 21% from May 2016 to January 2018.====One of the key differences between classical employment relations and freelance work is the flexibility of labor supply. While workers in classical employment relations are bound by contractual working hours over considerable time horizons, freelancers can frequently vary the quantity of work they offer or the number of assignments they accept. Firms employing them therefore face a dual incentive problem: ensuring both the quality of work in each assignment and getting freelancers to provide enough labor.==== This results in a trade-off related to the classical trade-off between risk and incentives. When objective performance measures are available, effort on a given assignment is best incentivized by paying freelancers a pure commission. Yet, such a payment scheme induces income uncertainty. This may reduce freelancers’ incentives to accept a sufficient number of assignments.==== As a consequence, it may be optimal for the platform to reduce commission rates and introduce a fixed payment per assignment. We argue that this trade-off between incentives for performance and labor supply may not only be affected by freelancers’ risk aversion, but also by their intrinsic motivation for the task at hand: workers with a high task motivation should reduce their effort per assignment to a lesser extent when the commission rate is reduced than workers with a lower motivation. The key intuition behind this hypothesis is that more motivated workers react less sensitively to differences in extrinsic incentives as their effort is to a larger extent driven by their own motivation for the task.====To test our hypotheses we implement a natural field experiment in the gig economy. Our intervention changes freelancer compensation in a way that insures them against earnings fluctuations. This allows us to address two research questions. The first focuses on our setting, where the firm’s objective is to increase freelancers’ labor supply without substantial performance losses: given workers’ preferences, should the firm continue to pay workers a pure commission or reduce the commission and add a fixed, certain payment per order? The second question is broader and has policy implications in other settings where freelance or atypical work is also common: how do workers with different task motivation and personality traits respond to compensation that reduces not only their earnings uncertainty but also their material performance incentives?====We first present a principal-agent model that captures a central feature of our empirical setting and of freelance work more generally: workers’ ability to choose both how much work to provide and how much effort to invest. Our pre-registered hypotheses predict that the intervention will increase freelancers’ labor supply and decrease their sales performance overall. The model further predicts that greater risk aversion will be associated with larger labor supply increases while the negative sales performance effect will be the less pronounced, the greater a worker’s intrinsic motivation.====For the field experiment we partnered with Zalon, an online provider of curated fashion shopping. The firm is part of Zalando, the largest online fashion retailer in Europe.==== Zalon relies on freelancers to provide remote styling services to fashion shoppers. It pays these stylists a pure commission on realized sales. Unlike gig workers on other platforms, Zalon’s freelance fashion consultants are selected based on their fashion affinity and on formal qualifications for the styling service. Many of the stylists, for example, are designers, tailors, and fashion students. As a consequence, intrinsic motivation is likely to play an important role in their freelance work. This differentiates our study from previous papers on the gig economy, which have focused on low-skilled, standardized and repetitive tasks.====All 202 new stylists starting work for Zalon between October 2016 and August 2017 participated in our RCT without knowing that they were part of a field experiment. We randomly allocated new stylists to the treatment or the control group sequentially - as they were hired. To increase power, we did so within four predicted labor supply strata. The individual treatment period consisted of the first two calendar months of stylists’ work for Zalon. Control group stylists received a pure commission of 15% of the sales each of their styling jobs generated. Treatment group stylists received a commission of 7.5% of sales plus a piece rate of €6.50 per order. We elicited workers’ risk aversion and intrinsic motivation for the task in a pre-experimental online questionnaire. Labor supply and sales performance are measured using Zalon’s order-level administrative data. Our proxy for labor supply is the total number of desired slots of each stylist during the treatment period; our measure for sales performance is net merchandise value (NMV) per order. Our setting is particularly suited for a field experiment as spillover effects are substantially less likely to appear than in typical firm-level field experiments: (i) stylists work independently from home and (ii) we only include newly hired stylists who hardly get in contact with each other.====We find that overall, the intervention did not significantly affect average labor supply. While the labor supply response also did not vary significantly by risk aversion, we find strong support for our hypothesis of a heterogeneous treatment effect on sales performance by intrinsic information, resulting in economically sizeable differences. More specifically, and in line with standard reasoning, the intervention reduced sales performance by 17% among less intrinsically motivated stylists (as classified by a median split). For the intrinsically more motivated stylists, however, the intervention increased performance by 10%. Hence, in this group, the performance reduction was not only mitigated as we hypothesized, but the better insurance even led to a higher motivation to perform. This is not only true in our main specifications, but also when we take into account that intrinsic motivation may be confounded by other personality traits or lower ability. It also holds when we consider customers’ repurchase rate as an alternative performance measure: in the group of workers with above-median intrinsic motivation for the task as measured by our pre-experimental survey, the treatment raised repurchase rates by 41%, while the treatment reduced repurchase rates by 53% in the less motivated group. Finally, while less intrinsically motivated agents reduced their labor supply when the commission rate was reduced, this was not the case for more motivated agents.====Hence, the treatment neither reduced labor supply nor sales performance for the more motivated agents, but tended to increase both. This pattern was not predicted by our model based on standard economic considerations. We provide a possible interpretation of this finding in the light of psychological Self-Determination Theory (see e.g. Gagné and Deci (2005), Ryan and Deci (2017), Ryan and Deci (2019)). This theory distinguishes between autonomous and controlled motivation, where the former is driven by one’s own volition, while the latter is based on extrinsic rewards or sanctions. A key claim in this literature is that autonomous motivation facilitates effective performance, in particular for those with a stronger need for autonomy. By providing better insurance and less performance-contingent pay, the treatment may thus have fostered autonomous motivation and, in turn, raised the performance of those who did the job more for the task’s than for money’s sake.====Our paper contributes to the literature on motivated agents (see e.g. Besley and Ghatak (2005), Delfgaauw and Dur (2008), Gerhards (2015), Ashraf et al. (2014), Fehrler and Kosfeld (2014), Carpenter and Gong (2016), Dur and van Lent (2018), Berg et al. (2019), Cassar (2019)).==== In particular, the finding that the reduction in performance pay did not reduce sales performance of workers who exhibit a high task motivation provides field evidence for the claim that, to raise performance, performance pay and intrinsic motivation can act as substitutes. Moreover, our results show that for motivated workers, the provision of insurance against income fluctuations may lead to higher performance even when material incentives become lower-powered.====Our findings also contribute to a nascent literature on the gig economy in applied microeconomics. Hall and Krueger (2018) present a detailed characterization of Uber’s U.S. driver-partners documenting, for instance, their greater similarity to the general workforce than to taxi drivers. The authors identify the flexibility to set hours as a key determinant of driver-partners’ decision to work with Uber.====Angrist et al. (2020) use an RCT at Uber to study the value to ride-hailing drivers of working with Uber as compared to a scenario similar to working as an independent taxi driver. Their experiment offers Uber drivers the opportunity to reduce the farebox share they have to pay Uber by purchasing a virtual taxi medallion lease. They use drivers’ self-selection into the treatment to quantify how valuable it is for gig workers to be able to drive without a lease. Based on this they argue that Uber’s existence creates a welfare gain for would-be entrepreneurs who would not purchase a taxi medallion. Our paper is similar to Angrist et al. (2020) in that both studies experimentally vary the incentive intensity on a gig-economy platform and study the response of freelancers’ labor supply. Our focus is very different, though: while they estimate the value of a specific gig-economy platform to its freelancers, we investigate costs and benefits of insuring its gig workers against income uncertainty.====The results of our paper also complement the growing field experimental literature analyzing the impact of incentives on performance in firms (see, e.g., Bandiera et al. (2007), Burgess et al. (2010), Hossain and List (2012), Delfgaauw et al. (2013), Delfgaauw et al. (2014), Friebel et al. (2017), Hong et al. (2018), and Manthei and Sliwka (2019)). A smaller body of field experimental work has started to investigate the role of individual motivation and personality traits in affecting the impact of incentives on performance, so far mostly studying service providers in developing countries (e.g., Ashraf et al. (2014) or Donato et al. (2017)). As we do, these papers collect a measure of individual traits that may drive motivation for a real-world task, experimentally vary extrinsic incentives for the task in an RCT, and then study heterogeneous treatment effects. The existing results are to some extent contradictory. Ashraf et al. (2014), for instance, find that monetary incentives have a stronger impact among workers with a higher intrinsic motivation which would indicate a complementarity between the respective trait and monetary incentives. In Donato et al. (2017), however, monetary incentives raise performance only for workers scoring low in conscientiousness (i.e. the Big-5 personality trait associated with diligence and dependability) but do not raise performance for conscientious workers. Our results are more in line with the latter, supporting the view that monetary incentives and intrinsic motivation are substitutes rather than complements.====Finally, our results may have implications for policy makers. Among (mainly legal) scholars, lawmakers, regulators and in the public domain there is an ongoing debate about whether gig economy firms should be required to treat freelancers as regular employees (Means and Seiner (2015), Cherry and Aloisi (2017), Kuhn and Maleki (2017), Prassl (2018)).==== This would have implications, for instance, for unemployment insurance, fair labor standards, and other labor market laws and regulations.==== Businesses facing potential regulation might fear that such rules would drastically increase costs and reduce the performance of their workforces. If, for example, gig economy firms had to convert their freelancers into regular employees, they would probably have to comply with minimum wage provisions. While our intervention does not test the introduction of a minimum wage for freelancers, its fixed payment per order in effect introduces an earnings floor per unit of time the freelancer makes available. Consequently, our results may be useful for policy makers trying to assess the costs (through potential losses in workers’ performance) that stricter regulation would impose on gig economy firms.",Motivating gig workers – evidence from a field experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001408,27 December 2021,2021,Research Article,129.0

Students aged 9 to 10 years are randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: gain framing of points (Control), gain framing with a negative endowment of points (Negative), and loss framing of points (Loss). Students in the Loss Treatment put more effort into the test, i.e., they answer more questions without decreasing the probability of a correct answer conditional on answering the question. Moreover, we find heterogeneous effects of grade framing by ability. Low-ability students in the Loss Treatment significantly decrease their performance while we find no significant effect for low-ability students in the Negative Treatment. In contrast, both treatments increase test performance of high-ability students.","Standardized tests are ubiquitous at nearly every level of education and often use multiple-choice testing formats. They determine admission to university (e.g., USA, Turkey, Finland), measure school effectiveness, and can shape education policy making (e.g., PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS). In multiple-choice tests, students usually have to identify the correct answer, they have the option to skip a question, and wrong answers are punished. Thus, students have to make risky choices among the possible options if they decide to answer a particular question but do not know the answer with certainty. Given the prevalence and importance of standardized tests, it is essential to try to better understand students’ behavior in these contexts, i.e., how and whether students decide to answer questions in the face of uncertainty, and how they can be “nudged” to answer more test items. According to prospect theory, choices framed as loss will induce risk-seeking behavior and choices framed as gain will induce risk-avoiding behavior (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In a multiple-choice test, students’ decision problem can be framed as a loss by manipulating the endowment of points and is the focus of this paper.====There is growing evidence that insights derived from the behavioral and social sciences, e.g., nudging and non-monetary (recognition) incentives, represent an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to financial incentives to motivate individuals (e.g., Bradler, Dur, Neckermann, Non, 2016, Cassar, Meier, 2018, Kube, Maréchal, Puppea, 2012). Moreover, a growing number of public policy makers and institutions have installed specialized behavioral insights teams to incorporate insights from behavioral economics into the design of more effective policy solutions (Madrian, 2014).==== Behaviorally informed interventions represent a cost-effective way to prevent students from investing poorly in their own education and dropping out of school too early. The use of behavioral interventions has risen sharply in the past few years and have produced positive effects on students’ educational achievements (see Damgaard and Nielsen, 2018, for a review of the literature). E.g., Bergman et al. (2020) and Bergman (2021) send text messages to parents, Clark et al. (2020) and van Lent and Souverijn (2020) examine goal setting, Himmler et al. (2019) test soft commitment devices, and Dobrescu et al. (2021) use real-time relative performance feedback. With regard to loss framing Fryer et al. (2012) and McEvoy (2016) find positive effects on students’ achievements whereas Apostolova-Mihaylova et al. (2015); Balart et al. (2020); Krawczyk (2011); Levitt et al. (2016) and Martinez (2014) find no effects of loss framing. Most of the existing evidence on behavioral insights in education is limited to adults or adolescents, while the sample of younger children is understudied. Our study differs in an important way from previous studies by examining the effectiveness of loss framing applied to====. Studying behavioral interventions among younger students is relevant because enhancing students’ positive attitude towards schooling might be especially effective in earlier stages of the education production function, as they might have long-lasting effects on students’ academic careers due to complementarities of skill formation (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).====Furthermore, we study students’ behavior in a low-stakes environment. Stakes in international comparative tests like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), or the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) are also low for students but might be high for schools and based on their outcomes often shape educational policy making. As Gneezy et al. (2019) show, ranking countries based on low stakes assessments is problematic because test scores reflect differences in intrinsic motivation to perform well on the test itself, and not just differences in ability. Therefore, knowing whether grade framing motivates students in a low stakes test can be valuable for teachers, schools, and education policy makers.====In this paper, we test whether manipulating the grading scheme in a multiple-choice test affects students’ willingness to make risky choices.==== The grading manipulation entails loss framing as the underlying behavioral prediction is that individuals are willing to take more risky decisions if a decision problem is presented as a loss rather than a gain. Moreover, framing points as losses represents a potential cost-effective and easy to implement way to change students’ test-taking behavior and has demonstrated—among adult samples—that the provision of effort is sensitive to incentives framing (Armantier, Boly, 2015, Hong, Hossain, List, 2015, Hossain, List, 2012). There is a growing literature that discusses why some behavioral insights are ineffective (Sunstein, 2017) and that warns about possible unintended consequences of behavioral policy interventions (Altmann, Grunewald, Radbruch, 2019, Caplin, Martin, 2016, Carlin, Gervais, Manso, 2013, de Haan, Linde, 2018). We contribute to this strand of the literature by analyzing whether unintended effects of loss framing exist for students at the high or low end of the ability distribution and for situations in which students face risky choices. We study loss framing in elementary schools as this group of children is not yet tracked by their ability, hence closer represents the general population (as compared to university student samples), and consists of students of the whole ability distribution.====The design of our experiment is motivated by the “reflection effect” and “shift of reference” as presented in prospect theory (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In one treatment (“reflection effect”), students face a decision between two negative prospects rather than a decision between two positive prospects (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, pp. 268–269). In another treatment (“shift of reference”), students face a loss in their initial endowment before making their decision (see Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, p. 286). To study the impact of these treatments on students’ motivation, we analyze their performance in a mathematics test under three differently framed grading schemes: (1) loss framing of points (Loss Treatment), (2) gain framing with a negative endowment of points (Negative Endowment Treatment), and gain framing of points (Control Group). In the Control Group earning points was framed as a gain: Students received 4 points for a correct answer, 2 points for skipping an answer, and 0 points for an incorrect answer.==== Hence, students could earn between 0 and 40 points. In the Negative Endowment Treatment, earning points was framed as in the Control Group—4 points for a correct answer, 2 points for skipping an answer, and 0 points for an incorrect answer—but students started the test with -20 points instead of 0 points and could earn between -20 and +20 points. Thus, these two treatments differ only with respect to students’ initial endowment. In the Loss Treatment, an incorrect answer and giving no answer was framed as a loss. Students started with the maximum score (+40 points) but lost 4 points for an incorrect answer, 2 points for a skipped question, and 0 points for a correct answer. In general, the empirical findings of this paper can contribute to the question according to what type-heterogeneity exists among very young students, i.e., do students behave according to Expected Utility Theory (EUT) or Prospect Theory (PT). In Appendix A we discuss type-heterogeneity in detail by first deriving theoretical predictions for the Loss and Negative Endowment Treatment applying both models (EUT and PT). Thereafter we discuss whether our empirical findings are informative about types, i.e., whether students are EUT or PT types.====The experiment was conducted in 20 elementary schools in Germany among 1,377 students of grades three and four (age 9 to 10). The experimental design allows to shed light on whether loss framing can be effective in a very low stakes environment as the test grade did not count towards the final course grade in math. Analyzing students’ behavior in a testing environment involving low stakes is relevant given their pervasiveness at all levels of education and the low stake nature of international comparative tests (e.g., TIMSS, PIRLS, PISA). In particular because student incentives for effort inputs (e.g., reading books) might be more effective than student incentives for performance outputs (Allington, McGill-Franzen, Camilli, Williams, Graff, Zeig, Zmach, Nowak, 2010, Fryer, 2011, Kim, 2007, Sadoff, 2014). As incentives for effort inputs are low stakes, the results of this study can be informative how to “frame” this kind of educational incentives.====We find significant treatment effects on students’ answering strategies, in particular their willingness to answer more questions. The Loss Treatment pushes students to make more active choices, that is, they answer significantly more questions instead of skipping them compared to students in the Control Group. At the same time, they do not decrease their probability of giving a correct answer conditional on answering the question which could be interpreted, together with an increase in the number of answered questions, as an increase in effort (it takes effort to answer more questions while maintaining the same probability of correctly answering).==== With regard to the number of points in the test, students in both treatment groups do not significantly increase their score compared to students the Control Group at the conventional levels of significance. We find heterogeneous effects of grade framing if we differentiate students by their ability. While high-ability students significantly increase the number of total points in both treatments, low-ability students significantly perform worse under the Loss Treatment compared to low-ability students in the Control Group. Interestingly, we do not find a negative effect of the Negative Endowment Treatment for low-ability students. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive treatment effects of the Loss and Negative Treatment are driven by students who are in the upper half of the ability distribution but who are not the highest performers of the class. This highlights that both treatments are effective in motivating a group of students that probably has the ability to do well, but requires the motivation to exert more effort. Our results show that there might be unintended consequences of behavioral interventions in education and that they might not be effective for students at the low end of the ability distribution—often the target population of education policy makers.====The paper is structured as follows.

Vacancy-posting is associated with a 4.4 percentage point increase in a firm’s hiring rate and 85% of the additional hiring occurs within two months. The response of hiring from employment is twice as large as the response of hiring from non-employment. Firms that are smaller, low-wage and fast-growing are associated with larger hiring responses and that response materializes faster at larger firms, low-wage firms and fast-growing firms. We also find that separations are associated with subsequent vacancy-posting and this effect is stronger for separations to employment, consistent with replacement hiring and the presence of vacancy chains. Growth in revenue and value added strongly predict vacancy-posting, with negative shocks having a stronger effect than positive shocks and larger shocks having less-than-proportional responses.","The starting point of the search-and-matching approach to labor market analysis is that it takes time and effort for workers to find desirable employers and for firms to find suitable employees. This approach can rationalize the coexistence of unemployed workers and vacancies, a key feature of labor markets, and it provides a coherent framework with which to study the process of matching in labor markets. While the empirical literature has documented a large set of facts about workers’ job-search process, including the speed of job finding and its dependence on workers’ observable characteristics and labor market conditions, the firm side of the market has been studied much less, largely due to a lack of appropriate data. A deeper understanding of when and how firms recruit, however, is essential for attaining a complete picture of the workings of labor markets both at the micro and at the macro level.====This paper uses uniquely detailed data from Denmark to document a novel set of empirical facts about firms’ search process. We find that firms’ vacancy-posting is associated with a significant increase in the hiring rate over several months and that the magnitude and timing of this increase is heterogeneous across firms of different sizes, growth rates, productivity and industry. Furthermore, we find that vacancy-posting increases following a rise in a firm’s separation rate, consistent with replacement hiring, and following growth in firm output, measured by revenue or value added.====We merge a large dataset of online job advertisements from 2003 to 2009 with a matched employer-employee dataset, with detailed information about individual labor market spells and transitions, and a firm-level VAT-account dataset, which provides information on firm revenues, purchases and value added. We measure firm recruiting effort at the extensive margin (whether the firm posts any advertisements in a given month or quarter) and the intensive margin (the firm’s vacancy rate in a given month or quarter) and call this effort “vacancy-posting”.====The first part of our analysis examines the association between vacancy-posting and hiring outcomes at the firm level. At the extensive margin, we find that vacancy-posting is associated with an increase of 4.4 percentage points in a firm’s monthly hiring rate, a rise of more than 70% over the baseline no-vacancy hiring rate. We find that 85% of this effect occurs in the month of vacancy-posting and the subsequent month. The hiring rate when no vacancies are posted is quantitatively large, consistent with the findings in the literature (e.g. Davis et al., 2013). At the intensive margin, we find a relatively weak linear association between the vacancy rate and the hiring rate. Bagger and Galenianos (2021) use a more flexible specification that allows for a nonlinear association on the same data and find a quantitatively and statistically significant relationship. Our findings suggest that online advertisements play an important, though not exclusive, role in firms’ recruiting process and that this process can be quite lengthy and diverse across firms.====We decompose the vacancy-posting and hiring rate relationship into hiring from employment and non-employment, based on newly-hired workers’ labor market status in the previous month. Vacancy-posting is associated with a doubling of the hiring rate from employment and a 50% increase in the hiring rate from non-employment, and that the former materialize at a slower pace than the latter.====In our firm heterogeneity analysis we find that, following vacancy-posting, firms with lower employment, lower wages, lower labor productivity and higher employment growth rates experience a larger increase in their hiring rates. Furthermore, the response materializes faster at larger firms, low wage (low productivity) firms, and fast-growing firms. Additionally the magnitude and timing of the hiring response to vacancy-posting varies considerably across industries. Overall, we find evidence for substantial heterogeneity in terms of the hiring response of different types of firms where, interestingly, the magnitude and the speed of the response do not necessarily co-move across firm types.====Turning to the determinants of vacancy-posting, we explore the effect of separations on the probability of posting a vacancy. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the separation rate is associated with an increase in the vacancy rate by 1 percentage point, a 100% increase over the no-separation baseline. The full effect takes 3 and 4 months to materialize. Furthermore, separations to employment have more than three times the effect on vacancy-posting than separations to non-employment. These findings are consistent with replacement hiring at the firm level, which generates vacancy chains and propagates labor market shocks (see, for example, Elsby, Michaels, Ratner, 2019, Mercan, Schoefer, 2020).====Finally, we explore the relationship between revenue and value added growth and vacancy-posting. A one standard deviation change in revenue growth is associated with a 9–11 percentage point change in the quarterly probability of vacancy-posting. Negative revenue growth is associated with larger (in absolute value) vacancy-posting responses than positive revenue growth, and we find evidence of concavity in these responses. Value added growth generates similar responses, though slightly smaller in magnitude. Bagger et al. (2021) explore this further by separately estimating the effects of permanent and transitory output shocks on the vacancy-posting probability.====These empirical findings have implications for theoretical modeling of the labor market. First, theoretical models should account for the large heterogeneity in the hiring response to vacancy-posting across firms of different size, productivity and growth rates. Second, they should account for the finding that separations predict vacancy-posting. Third, they should account for the asymmetric and non-linear relationship between output growth and vacancy-posting. We discuss these in some more detail in Section 6.====Our paper contributes to the empirical literature that studies the effect of vacancies on hiring outcomes, early contributions to which include (Burdett, Cunningham, 1998, van Ours, Ridder, 1992). Davis et al. (2013) is probably the most prominent work in this literature and uses the US firm survey JOLTS to document several interesting features, particularly about the heterogeneous hiring outcomes of vacancy-posting across different establishment types and the large share of hires that occur without reporting an available vacancy. Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2021) and Mueller et al. (2020) combine vacancy information with matched employer-employee datasets in Germany and Austria, respectively, and study the determinants of vacancy duration and vacancy yield. Our paper is also related to empirical work on vacancies using online job board data such as Banfi and Villena-Roldan (2019); Davis and Samaniego de la Parra (2017); Hershbein and Kahn (2018); Marinescu and Wolthoff (2020); Modestino et al. (2019) among others.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data that we use in our analysis. Section 3 examines the effect of vacancy-posting on hiring rates, including a detailed firm-heterogeneity analysis. Section 4 examines the effect of separations on vacancy-posting, and Section 5 examines the effect of output growth on vacancy-posting. Section 6 briefly discusses some the implications of our findings for theoretical models of the labor market and for future empirical work.","Vacancies, employment outcomes and firm growth: Evidence from Denmark",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712100138X,24 December 2021,2021,Research Article,131.0
Harris Jorgen,"Occidental College Department of Economics, 208 Fowler Hall, 4910 Range View Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90042, United States","Received 14 July 2021, Revised 9 December 2021, Accepted 16 December 2021, Available online 21 December 2021, Version of Record 30 December 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2021.102102,Cited by (1),"I present causal evidence on the effect of women's entry into occupations on wages in the United States. I construct a shift-share instrument that interacts the dramatic increase in women's educational attainment and workforce participation from 1960 to 2010 with the likelihood that men and women enter each occupation. I find that a 10 percentage-point increase in the female fraction within an occupation leads to an 8 percent decrease in average male wage and a 7 percent decrease in average female wage in the concurrent census year, and an 9 percent decrease in male wages and a 14 percent decrease in female wages over 10 years.","Among full-time workers in the United States, women earn 19% less than men on average (Blau and Kahn, 2016). While this wage gap has closed since the 1960s, it has changed less than would be expected based on women's relative gains in education and experience. This persistent wage gap can be accounted for primarily by the fact that women work in lower-paying occupations and industries than do men, with occupation and==== industry accounting for 51% of the wage gap in 2010 (Blau and Kahn, 2016). As a result, understanding why female-dominated occupations pay less than do male-dominated occupations is crucial to understanding why women earn less than men. This paper presents evidence that the presence of women in an occupation results in declines in average wages for both men and women in that occupation. This finding suggests that differences in pay between male and female dominated occupations may reflect ways in which the gender of workers changes the nature and compensation of work.====This finding complicates prior literature on gender and occupation, which has focused on two broad explanations for the negative relationship between women's representation and pay in occupations. Differences in the occupations of men and women may reflect differences in their constraints, preferences and abilities. In this case, women's greater household responsibilities would lead women to choose less demanding, lower productivity, and lower paying jobs relative to men with equal levels of human capital (Becker, 1985).==== Alternately, discrimination may push women to work in lower-paying occupations than similar men, because women may face greater barriers in high-paying male-dominated occupations than they do in similarly skillful but lower-paying female-dominated occupations. These barriers can take many forms, such as lower likelihood of promotion (Thomas, 2019; Maume, 1999), reduced access to mentorship and networking (Chen et al., 2015), or higher rates of discrimination and sexual harassment (Parker, 2018).====Both of these explanations examine why otherwise similar men and women may choose differently among the bundles of wages and amenities offered by different occupations. However, if the presence of women in an occupation causes a decline in that occupation's wages, even arbitrary and idiosyncratic differences in the way that men and women choose occupations will lower average female wages relative to male wages. In turn, failure to recognize this could lead policymakers to overestimate the benefits of changing the occupation decisions of women.====A large sociology literature has examined the relationship between the gender composition of occupations and their wages, typically finding negative correlations between changes in average male and female wage and changes in the female share of an occupation's workforce.==== However, this work can only be considered causal under the very strong assumption that changes in men and women's occupation choices are exogenous to the earnings trajectories of occupations. This assumption is unlikely to hold: while men continue to work in higher wage occupations than women on average, female representation in higher wage occupations has increased over the last half-century (Blau and Kahn, 2016). Because wage inequality has increased over this time period, occupations with increasing female shares of the workforce are likely to have higher-than average wage growth, resulting in upward bias.====I present evidence on the effect of changes in the gender composition of an occupation on wages that more plausibly handles these selection problems. I estimate a panel regression of the log average male and female wage of older workers in an occupation on the fraction of female workers among younger workers in that occupation.==== Because changes in the gender composition of an occupation may be driven by factors that influence current and future wages, I construct a shift-share instrument for gender composition identified from the dramatic increase in relative female labor force participation and educational attainment from 1960 to 2010, measured using the US decennial census. Over this time, the female share of educated workers under the age of 35 increased rapidly, particularly for advanced degree holders. These change are unlikely to be attributable to changes in the wages of particular occupations—prior work has attributed increases in women's work and education to increased access to contraceptives (Bailey et al., 2012), changing cultural attitudes towards female labor force participation, and changes in the administration of high schools and universities (Goldin et al., 2006).====This increase in women's work and education increased the availability of women in all occupations that primarily hired workers with college and advanced degrees. However, because similarly educated men and women tend to work in different occupations, some occupations were more exposed to this change than others. Occupations that are chosen at similar rates by educated men and women, such as psychology, had larger induced changes in the female fraction of workers than did occupations that are disproportionately chosen by either men or women, such as physics or nursing. Occupations chosen equally by men and women had the largest induced change in gender composition because female-dominated occupations had little scope to increase their fraction female, while few of the newly-educated female workers sorted into male-dominated occupations.====I use this difference across occupations in exposure to the increased availability of educated female workers to construct a shift-share instrument for the gender composition of each occupation (Bartik, 1991). This instrument estimates the fraction of available workers in each occupation who would be female if the proportion of workers with each education level, as well as the likelihood that a male or female worker of each education level worked in the occupation, remained fixed to their 1980 levels,==== while the gender composition of each education level varied over time. Because it is not identified off of changes in the occupational preferences of men and women, this instrument is not exposed to the endogenous relationship between changes in occupational preferences and changes in wages.====I find strong evidence that increased female representation among young workers in an occupation leads to lower average wages for older men and women, both in the immediate term and in the longer term. I estimate that a 10 percentage-point increase in the female share of an occupation's workforce leads to an 7% decline in average female wage, and a 7.7% decline in average male wage, measured contemporaneously. Over the following ten years, the effect grows to a 9.4% decline in average wage for males and a 13.7% decline in average wage for females. Over the following 20 years, the effect on wage falls to a 4.4% decline in average male wage and a 7.1% decline in average female wage. These results are large compared to the cross-sectional relationship between gender composition and pay. In 2010, when controlling for age and education, a 10 percentage point higher female share was associated with 4.6% lower average wages for men and a 4.1% lower average wages for women (Appendix Table A.1).====While this approach faces far fewer threats to identification than does prior work, it leaves open two potential sources of endogeneity, which I account for. First, the increase in women's work and education that led to changes in occupations’ gender composition also affected labor supply. As a result, I must disentangle the labor supply effect of women's work and education decisions from the gender composition effect of those decisions. I do this by constructing a control for “induced labor supply”—that is, for changes in labor supply that would have resulted from changes in men and women's work and education decisions, were men and women's occupation choices unchanged. This control accounts for the fact that the rise in women's education and labor force participation increases labor supply in occupations that predominantly employ highly educated women.==== Because the occupations with the greatest predicted changes in gender composition are gender-balanced, while the occupations with the greatest predicted change in labor supply are female-dominated, this labor supply control is not collinear with the gender composition instrument.====Second, while the use of this instrument addresses many of the confounding relationships between changes in an occupation's gender composition and changes in wages, shift-share instruments may be confounded by occupation characteristics that are correlated with the base-year occupation decisions of men and women. Of particular concern is the possibility that an occupation's gender composition in 1980 is related to the occupation's skill requirements. In this case, changes in the returns to skills over the last half-century could affect the wages of occupations with large predicted changes in gender composition differently than they affect the wages of occupations with small predicted changes. Work by Autor et al. (2003) and (Deming, 2017) have identified several key dimensions of skill that have seen changing returns over this period, with the returns to social skills, math/analytical skills and service increasing and the returns to routine tasks decreasing. While these skills are weakly related to the gender composition of occupations, with social skill requirements highest and math/analytical skills lowest in female-dominated occupations, there is substantial variation in the skill requirements of occupations with similar gender ratios. The negative effect of increased percent female on wage is robust to the inclusion of time-varying skill effects, indicating that changing returns to skills identified as important in previous literature do not explain the estimated relationship.====I make several contributions to the literature. First, I contribute to a related literature on the effect of working in a female-dominated occupation on the wage of an individual worker, pioneered by (Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995) and updated by Addison et al. (2018).==== Macpherson and Hirsch measure the effect of the gender composition of a worker's occupation on wages for workers who changed occupations in the CPS. While this analysis finds evidence that workers received lower pay in occupations with a higher share of female workers, the difference is mostly explained by measured job characteristics, including training requirements and occupational hazards. This work provides compelling evidence that workers on the margin between male-dominated and female-dominated occupations do not require a compensating differential for working in the male-dominated occupation. However, this research design cannot speak to the question of whether the process by which wages are determined differs between male and female dominated occupations.====Next, I contribute to a growing literature examining the effect of changes in gender composition on the characteristics of occupations. Previous research has hypothesized that the entry of women into an occupation causes declines in that occupation's prestige (Goldin, 2014a), asd a shift in compensation structure toward lower wages and higher nonwage amenities (Lee and Thomson, 2019). These hypotheses are supported by the exit of men from occupations that pass a threshold percentage female (Pan, 2010). In addition, Goldin and Katz (2011a, 2012) find that the gender composition of an occupation coevolves with returns to long hours and rates of independent firm ownership, and they speculate that some of that coevolution may be due to the effect of a growing female workforce on the organization of occupations. The large, negative effect of gender composition on wage found in this paper suggests that these hypothesized effects of gender composition on occupations may be large and have significant wage consequences.",Do wages fall when women enter an occupation?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001378,21 December 2021,2021,Research Article,132.0

The findings have implications for understanding the contribution of search frictions to wage ==== and the sullying effect of recessions.","In search of a job, a worker may receive more than one offer, and comparable workers may receive different numbers of offers. In a seminal work, Burdett and Judd (1983) demonstrate that the presence of multiple offers could lead to wage dispersion “in environments with identical and rational agents on both sides of the market”.==== Despite the importance of multiple offers for understanding the contribution of search frictions to wage dispersion, there is little evidence on either the prevalence or the impact of multiple offers at the labor market level, probably because labor market surveys rarely ask whether a worker has ever had multiple offers simultaneously.====This paper attempts to fill this gap by utilizing a unique question in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The question asks directly whether a worker chose his/her present work over another job opportunity available at the time the worker first started the present work. Focusing on new hires from non-employment, this paper documents that (1) over 30% of them had multiple offers simultaneously just before starting the present job, (2) an one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 6.6 percentage point decrease in the probability of multiple offers, and (3) relative to workers with one offer, comparable workers with multiple offers enjoy a persistent wage premium of over 10% for about nine years. Together, the evidence suggests that multiple offers are prevalent and pro-cyclical, and their effects are significant and persistent.====The findings make several contributions to our understanding of the labor market. First, because the size of the multiple-offer wage premium is directly related to the dispersion of the wage offer distribution, its estimate is informative of the contribution of search frictions to wage inequality. Incorporating multiple offers into a simple search model, I show that the estimated multiple-offer wage premium implies the standard deviation of log wage offers is about 15.8%, smaller than most of the estimates in the literature.==== This suggests the challenge faced by search models in simultaneously accounting for the observed rates of labor market transitions and the dispersion of wage offers is not as big as previously thought.==== Moreover, the model implies search frictions explain less than 27.2% of overall wage inequality. This upper bound is consistent with and complements other estimates in the literature, e.g., Gottfries and Teulings (2021), Vejlin and Veramendi (2021) and Taber and Vejlin (2020).====Second, the persistence of the multiple-offer wage premium is indicative of how search frictions could have a lasting impact through interactions with other wage determinants. Using the simple search model with multiple offers, I show that the multiple-offer wage premium would decline rapidly and vanish in about four years in the absence of other labor market frictions. The fact that it remains significant for about nine years suggests there are other forces at play. I provide suggestive evidence that multiple offers have a significant and persistent effect on a worker’s occupation. The evidence is consistent with previous findings that human capital is occupation-specific such that a temporary shock that leads to a worse occupation can give rise to persistent wage scars by delaying the speed of learning about one’s comparative advantage and the accumulation of occupation-specific human capital, e.g., Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) and Wee (2016).====Third, the cyclicality of multiple offers contributes to our understanding of the sullying effect of recessions. If non-employed workers are less likely to receive multiple offers in recessions, they would be more likely to find employment in low-wage jobs. This provides a new explanation for the cyclical upgrading of labor where more workers are employed in high-wage jobs in booms than recessions.==== Different from existing explanations that involve either worker heterogeneity, e.g., McLaughlin and Bils (2001) and Huckfeldt (2022), or on-the-job search, e.g., Barlevy (2002), Krause and Lubik (2006) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2013), this new channel requires neither. Moreover, given the significant and persistent multiple-offer wage premium, the cyclicality of multiple offers provides a novel explanation for the scarring effect of entering the labor market in a recession documented in a growing literature.====Finally, the findings provide empirical justifications for models of multiple offers like Albrecht et al. (2006), Galenianos and Kircher (2009), Kircher (2009) and Wolthoff (2014). Motivated by the evidence in this paper, I endogenize multiple offers in a standard search and matching model in Guo (2021a). The model predicts that a decrease in aggregate productivity reduces the fraction of unemployed workers with multiple offers and, in turn, the probability that a low-wage offer is rejected. In response, firms post relatively more low-wage vacancies when productivity is low. This leads to a counterclockwise rotation of both the wage offer distribution and the wage distribution of new hires from unemployment, because wages at the upper end of the two distributions are reduced (shifted to the left) by more than wages at the lower end.====Three recent labor market surveys ask the number of offers received by a worker during a specific period of time: the last 7 days in the survey by Krueger and Mueller (2011), the last 4 weeks in the survey by Faberman et al. (2021), and the last 4 months in the survey by Conlon et al. (2018). Not surprisingly, workers do report receiving multiple offers during the specified period of time. For example, using data from the survey by Krueger and Mueller (2011), Hall and Mueller (2018) report that, among the unemployed who reported receiving at least one job offer in the last 7 days, “86.3% reported that they received one offer in the last 7 days, 8.6% reported receiving two offers in the last 7 days, 2.4% received three offers, and the remaining 2.7% received between four and 10 offers in the last 7 days”. So the fraction with multiple offers in the last 7 days among those with at least one offer is 13.7%. The survey was conducted between September 2009 and April 2010 when the unemployment rate was nearly 10%. Given the negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the fraction with multiple offers documented in this paper, the fraction of unemployed workers with multiple offers in the last 7 days among those with at least one offer could be much higher than 13.7% during normal times. Faberman et al. (2021) find the fraction of unemployed workers who received 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 or more offers in the last 4 weeks are 22.8%, 8.3%, 0.9%, 2.0% and 0.2%, respectively.==== So the fraction with multiple offers among those with at least one offer is 33.3% (====), which is remarkably close to the estimate in this paper. Using the survey by Conlon et al. (2018), Guo (2021b) finds that, among workers who reported receiving at least one offer in the last 4 months, “55% reported one offer, 25% reported two offers, 10% reported three offers, and the rest 10% reported four or more offers”.====Different from the surveys by Krueger and Mueller (2011) and Faberman et al. (2021), which only ask about the wage of the best offer even if a worker reported receiving multiple offers, the survey by Conlon et al. (2018) asks respondents to report the wages of the (up to) 3 best offers. Guo (2021b) shows how we could use the multiple wages reported by the same worker to identify the wage offer distribution nonparametrically. Empirically, Guo (2021b) finds a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 13.7% is consistent with the data on log wage offers, and this implies a multiple-offer wage premium of about 10%, which is extremely close to the estimates in this paper. Other than this, I am not aware of any estimate of the multiple-offer wage premium in the literature.====One weakness of all three surveys is that they do not ask about the exact time each offer was received and accepted/rejected. Without this information, we do not know whether a worker has ever had multiple offers simultaneously. This issue is presumably more severe for the survey by Conlon et al. (2018) than it is for the survey by Krueger and Mueller (2011), because a worker who reported receiving two or more offers in the last 4 months is less likely to have ever had multiple offers simultaneously than a worker who reported receiving two or more offers in the last 7 days.==== Moreover, since the three surveys are either cross-sectional or very short panels (less than a year), they cannot be used to study the persistent effect of multiple offers, which is the main focus of this paper.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the data and reports the prevalence and cyclicality of multiple offers. Section 3 estimates the effects of multiple offers on individual wages and occupations over time. Section 4 discusses the implications on wage inequality and the lasting impact of recessions. The last section concludes the paper.

In addition, we provide causal effects of education on different types of migration. We find that education substantially increases the incidence of ever-migrating by the mid-20 s for men but not for women. However, using a dataset that comprises complete migration histories, including the reason for each migration, we show that women become more likely to migrate at earlier ages, and their migration reasons change. Women become more likely to move for ==== and employment purposes and less likely to be tied-movers.","A well-established finding in population research is that more educated individuals have a higher propensity to migrate within a country (Greenwood, 1997, ch. 12). However, this positive correlation may not be pointing to a causal relationship due to unobservable individual characteristics that shape both education and migration decisions (Sjaastad, 1962). Only a few studies exist in the literature that identifies education's causal effect on migration propensity. In addition to providing evidence on the causal effect of education on the migration propensity of young men and women in Turkey, we extend this sparse literature by examining the effect of education on the timing of migration and distinguishing across different reasons for migration among young women in Turkey. For this purpose, we combine a strong source of exogenous variation in schooling with rich data on migration outcomes after age 15, including both interregional and intraregional movements.====We use the 1997 compulsory schooling reform in Turkey as the source of exogenous variation in schooling. This reform increased compulsory schooling from 5 to 8 years and impacted heavily schooling outcomes, increasing the percentage of individuals with a middle school or higher degree by around 17 points among men and 21 points among women. The data concerned with the migration propensity of young men and women after age 15 come from the yearly Turkish Household Labor Force Surveys from 2009 to 2017. To analyze the timing and type of migration among women, we draw data from Turkey's 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. The key distinguishing feature of the latter dataset is that it includes the complete migration history of women—including the reason for migration in each move (education, employment, marriage, tied-mover either with parents or with the spouse). This analysis focuses on young women, for whom the migration incidence is higher than for other individuals. We estimate the effect of education on migration for various reasons at each age from 15 to mid-20 s.====The context of our study differs from the few existing studies on this topic—all of which focus on developed countries, except for a concurrent paper (Sakai and Masuda, 2020).==== The level, timing, and reason for internal migration may differ between developed and developing countries for several reasons. First, the composition of production and employment, which affect the incentives for migration, is different in developing countries. For example, more people live in rural areas and work in agriculture, and self-employment vis-à-vis wage employment is more common in urban areas. In addition, structural transformations such as a sectoral shift from agriculture to industry and services occurring in developing countries induce migration patterns that differ from those in developed countries. Second, significant differences exist in demographic characteristics that interact with mobility, such as marriage rates, assortative mating patterns, age at marriage, and fertility patterns (Anukriti and Dasgupta, 2018). However, no evidence exists so far about the causal effect of education on internal migration in developing country contexts, and our paper provides the first evidence on this issue.====Hicks (1932) proposed that differences in net economic advantages, mainly differences in wages, across geographic regions are the leading causes of migration (see also Sjaastad, 1962). This hypothesis interprets migration as a form of human capital investment and forms the basis of most analyses of migration. In this framework, education may change migration prospects by altering the return portfolio across locations or affecting moving costs. The current literature studying the effect of education on migration interprets its findings under the above hypothesis that internal migration arises due to geographic differences in labor market opportunities. Individuals, however, may migrate for various reasons, including a change in marital status, attending or leaving college, climate, and health reasons. For example, migration for reasons other than employment is high in Turkey (68.3%),==== which suggests that interpreting the impact of education on migration only through the lens of employment can be misleading.====Our focus on women's migration patterns is critical because the motivations for migration could differ significantly by gender. Women, particularly in developing countries, are often considered tied movers either with their family or spouse—as dependents rather than migrants in their own right. In addition, there are often informal barriers against women's mobility for employment and education in developing countries due to conservative social norms. For instance, migration for marriage accounts for more than 90% of all migration by women in India (NSSO, 2005).==== On the other hand, several studies report increasing migration rates of women in developing countries for employment purposes.==== In these settings, migration can be a crucial channel in women's empowerment, as they can reach better educational and employment opportunities via migration and overcome established social norms.==== Such empowerment of women would further contribute to economic development and better society-wide outcomes (Duflo, 2012).==== Indeed, even without economic development, improvement in women's employment and educational outcomes via migration, and the resulting reduction in gender gaps in these outcomes, is a desirable goal by itself.====The effect of increased education on migration propensity may differ across moves motivated by different reasons, increasing some prospects while decreasing others. While an education-induced increase in the earnings potential of females may reduce migration among females as tied-movers, it may increase migration of women for other purposes, such as employment and human capital acquisition. For instance, compared to a high school dropout, a female high school graduate may be more likely to relocate in order to attend university in another region and less likely to marry at earlier ages and relocate for family-related reasons. Due to such potential differences, studying the causal effect of education on different migration types can provide new insights into the role of education in mobility decisions.====The compulsory schooling (CS) reform that we exploit for identification is particularly attractive from a methodological perspective for several reasons. First, as we discuss below, the primary motivation for the reform was political, and the timing was independent of the macroeconomic context that may affect migration incentives. Second, this reform binds a cross-section of the population, unlike the studies in developed country settings where the affected population comes from the lower end of the ability distribution. Around 47% of the school-aged children in Turkey did not continue school beyond grade 5 in the 1996–97 school year, the year before the CS law changed. Hence, the reform affected a substantial fraction of the population in our context, and the resulting local average treatment estimate (LATE) is closer to the average treatment effect (ATE) than those in previous studies.==== Third, the extension in schooling was high, increasing CS by three years. The fact that the policy bound a significant fraction of the school-age population, which, in turn, increased schooling by three years, provides a very strong first stage in our estimation. Finally, reforms of this type have been carried out in European and North American contexts, including those affecting similar grade levels, and many lower-income countries where compulsory schooling is around five years may still carry out such reforms.====In the estimation, we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) with the TDHS, but an instrumental-variables approach based on the differences in policy exposure across birth cohorts with the THLFS—due to the differences in the structure of the two datasets. Our results using THLFS data show a strong effect of education on ever-migrating from age 15 to mid-20 s for men but not for women. Obtaining at least a middle school degree increases the probability of migration by about 50% for men aged 23–30. This level analysis, however, masks the timing effects for women. TDHS data analysis reveals that women become more likely to migrate earlier and for different purposes. In particular, while education does not change the propensity to migrate by age 24, it changes the age when migration occurs. The incidence of migration for education purposes increases remarkably until the early 20 s. There is some suggestive evidence that migration for employment purposes also rises. At the same time, women become less likely to migrate as tied-movers (with parents or spouses).====These results indicate that an increase in educational attainment changes the timing of migration and the distribution of migration reasons among women. Hence, education empowers women by increasing their earning potential and enhancing their migration for further human capital acquisition and employment. As a result, women become less likely to move as secondary migrants and start accumulating migration capital earlier in their life cycle.====In the next section, we discuss the relevant literature, followed by a discussion of the conceptual framework in Section 3. Section 4 describes the education system and the CS reform in Turkey. Section 5 discusses the data used in the analysis, and Section 6 presents the identification method and estimation.

Using linked employer-employee data, we provide an ==== evaluation of the impact of those policies. Our estimates suggest that minimum wage increases reduced employment growth and profitability, in particular for financially distressed firms. We also conclude that minimum wage increases had a positive impact on firms’ exit, again amplified for financially distressed firms. According to these results, minimum wage policies may have had a supply side effect by accelerating the exit of low profitability and low productivity firms and, thus, contributing to improve aggregate productivity through a cleansing effect.","This paper assesses the impact on firms of minimum wage policies in Portugal, since the end of the Financial Assistance Programme in 2014. The goal of those measures was to reduce poverty and income inequality. The strong increase in the share of workers earning the minimum wage — from 13.2% in 2014 to 25.7% in 2017 — raised concerns about the impact of its increase on firms activity and financial condition. Business associations — especially in the traditional sectors, such as apparel and textiles — were vocal about the potential negative consequences of these increases, given that Portugal had been through a severe debt and banking crisis, that left many firms financially vulnerable and constrained in their ability to adjust to the increase in wage costs. After the initial controversy, the discussion on this topic faded away because it occurred in the context of a strong rise in employment and a sharp reduction in unemployment, as the economy rebounded from the crisis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evaluation of the impact of those minimum wage increases. The first contribution of this paper is to present an evaluation of the impact of those policies on firms’ employment, profitability and exit. Our estimates support business associations concerns, suggesting that minimum wage increases reduced employment growth and profits, and accelerated the exit of financially distressed firms. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on the financial situation of firms — which led to credit deferrals that amounted to over 20% of total bank credit (European Banking Authority, 2020) — has revived interest in this issue, given that the minimum wage in Portugal has continued to increase in spite of the recession.====The costs of social policies implemented through minimum wage increases are, at least partially, borne by firms. The share borne by a specific firm depends on several factors. First, the impact on firms’ total costs depends on the share of workers affected by the new minimum wage. Second, it will depend on the firms’ ability to absorb the wage cost shock by adjusting its profit margin and/or to pass the cost increase to consumers. Finally, the impact of minimum wage policies will depend on firms’ flexibility to change their capital-to-labor ratio. If firms are unable to fully offset the impact of the minimum wage increase, their financial condition will worsen. In more extreme cases, namely when firms are financially distressed, the minimum wage increase may lead to the death of the firm. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new, more complete measure, of the potential relative cost increase (PRCI) for firms of minimum wage policies, making use of a very rich firm-level database. In our data, the value of PRCI is higher for the group of financially distressed firms than for the rest of the economy, suggesting that those firms are more vulnerable to minimum wage increases.====While the main dispute in the literature has concerned the impact of minimum wage increases on employment (e.g., contrast the views expressed in Dube (2019), and Neumark and Shirley (2021), a very recent strand of the literature has been focusing on the impact of minimum wage increases on the financial condition of firms. Examples include Draca et al. (2011), for the introduction of a minimum wage in the United Kingdom in 1999; Harasztosi and Lindner (2019) for a large increase in the Hungarian minimum wage in 1997–2004; Chava et al. (2019) for 14 states of the USA, with a focus on the credit score of small firms; and Drucker et al. (2021) for Israel in 2003–2010. Bell and Machin (2018) conclude that low-wage UK firms had significant falls in their stock market value following the announcement of a big change in the minimum wage. All these papers present evidence of a negative impact of minimum wage increases on firms’ profitability.====Framed by this line of research, the third contribution of this paper is to show that minimum wage increases are particularly detrimental to financially distressed firms. The relation between firms financial conditions and minimum wage increases is especially relevant in the Portuguese economy because a significant share of the firms are highly indebted, and have very low profitability and liquidity. Therefore, in our econometric analysis we allow for the possibility that the minimum wage increase has a more acute effect on financially distressed firms. Our results warrant this hypothesis. According to the estimates reported in this paper, minimum wage increases lead to lower profits and lower employment growth, with magnified effects for financially distressed firms. These results suggest that policy makers should take into account the financial condition of firms when deciding minimum wage increases.====The empirical literature on the impact of minimum wage increases on firm exit is also relatively recent. Draca et al. (2011) presents industry-level evidence of the impact of the introduction of a minimum wage in the UK and concludes that the probability of exit increased 1.5 percentage points. Mayneris et al. (2018) detects evidence of a ‘cleansing’ effect of the large increases in the minimum wage in 2004 in China, i.e., less productive firms were more likely to be exposed to the minimum wage increase and were also more likely to exit. Chava et al. (2019) relate increases in the minimum wage to lower credit scores and consequent higher exit rates of small businesses in the USA. Aaronson et al. (2018) and Luca and Luca (2019) focus on restaurants; both conclude that minimum wage rises increase the probability of exit.====Adding to this discussion, the fourth contribution of this paper is to show that minimum wage increases acted as a potential accelerator of the exit of financially distressed firms, also known as zombie firms. This conclusion indicates that minimum wage policies may have compensated for some inefficiency of the insolvency framework. Therefore, our results suggest that minimum wage increases produce a cleansing effect, which may foster a more efficient resource allocation and productivity growth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the issue of zombie firms has re-emerged, given the severity of the crisis and the Governments’ intervention to support firms (European Central Bank, 2021). The ECB’s 2021 Financial Stability Review highlights the risks of inefficient insolvency frameworks, which might contribute to the prevalence of zombie firms and, thus, hamper productivity growth. In this context, the evaluation of the impact of minimum wage increases on firm exit, namely of zombie firms, becomes even more relevant.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

I find that suspending work requirements does not discourage employment; a decrease in employment of more than 1.4 percentage points among people who are potentially affected by the exemptions can be ruled out with a 95% confidence interval. I also find evidence of a reduction in hours of work among older prime-age workers due to the work exemption. Further analysis uncovers two reasons why the work exemption has little effect on employment. First, many new SNAP participants who enrolled due to the exemption are the long-term non-employed who have no labor supply to reduce. Second, the generous income deductions in benefit calculation act as a work incentive by significantly lowering the effective benefit reduction rate at very low income ($0–600). These findings indicate that the SNAP work requirement may not achieve the intended goal of promoting employment; instead it may increase the risk of disadvantaged individuals failing to receive the assistance they need.","A sizable portion of government spending goes to welfare programs designed to help low-income individuals and families make ends meet. In 2016, expenditures on government safety net programs accounted for about $880 billion, or 19%, of the U.S. federal budget (Falk et al., 2018). The level of government spending on safety net programs has long been a contentious issue. While aid to low-income households can help them cover necessary expenses, it may reduce incentives for beneficiaries to find or keep work. This issue has received greater public and political attention in recent years due to the notion that the slow recovery of the economy following the Great Recession is in part a result of the expansion in safety net programs (Mulligan, 2012).====To address work disincentives, many safety net programs include work-related policies such as work requirements and time limits. For example, eligibility for benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is tied, for a subset of recipients, to participation in work or activities, such as job training or community service for a certain number of hours (Falk et al., 2016). However, broad consensus does not exist on whether SNAP work requirements achieve their intended goal of improving the work level of low-income individuals and families. This paper contributes to this debate by assessing the impact of SNAP work requirements on the labor supply of able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD).====To study the effect of SNAP work requirements on the labor supply, I leverage two unique features of SNAP work requirements. First, states can exempt individuals living in areas with high unemployment rates from meeting work requirements, creating variation in the work exemption across areas over time. Second, the work requirement applies only to adults below 50 years of age. Because exemption from the SNAP work requirement is heavily linked to the economic conditions in a given area, a comparison of outcomes between exempt areas and non-exempt areas is likely to produce a biased estimate of the effect of SNAP work requirements. However, the additional within-area variation stemming from the age threshold allows one to disentangle the confounding influence of local economic conditions from the impact of SNAP work requirements. If local labor market conditions affect non-disabled adults without dependents aged just below 50 similarly to those just above 50, then one can identify the effect of work requirements by comparing the time-series changes in labor supply for these two age groups in areas before and after the exemption.====Using a triple-difference approach that compares the differences in labor supply of ABAWDs aged below 50 and those above in areas before and after the exemption coupled with data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2005 to 2017, I estimate the local average treatment effect of work requirements for ABAWDs around the age of 50.====I find that SNAP work exemptions do not decrease employment among older prime-age ABAWDs. A reduction in employment of more than 1.4 percentage points among older prime-age ABAWDs who are potentially affected by the exemptions can be rejected with a 95% confidence interval. However, I find evidence that the work exemption leads to a reduction in hours of work by older prime-age workers.====Further analysis reveals two reasons the work exemption has little effect on the extensive margin of labor supply. First, many new SNAP participants who enrolled due to the exemption are the long-term non-employed who have no labor supply to reduce. Second, the generous income deductions in benefit calculation reduce the effective benefit reduction rate close to zero at very low income ($0–600), decreasing the potential disincentive effect of the work exemption on labor supply along the extensive margin while increasing the intensive margin labor supply response to the work exemption. Together, the results suggest that imposing work requirements may not achieve the intended goal of promoting employment; instead, it may increase the risk of disadvantaged individuals failing to receive the assistance they need.====These findings have implications for the design of transfer programs. Saez (2002) showed that the optimal design of transfer programs depends on the margin of behavioral responses. In particular, providing transfers for low-income workers rather than the non-worker can be optimal if the labor supply responses are concentrated along the extensive margin, whereas providing the highest benefits to non-workers with a positive benefit reduction rate can be optimal if the intensive margin labor supply is more responsive than the extensive margin labor supply. Therefore, the results in this study suggest that the optimal transfer structure for older prime-age ABAWDs closely resembles that of SNAP without the work requirement.====This paper builds upon literature on the labor supply effect of work policies in welfare programs. Much of the literature come from evaluations of state welfare reform experiments conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. (Friedlander and Burtless, 1995; Bloom and Michalopoulos, 2001; Blank, 2002; Grogger and Karoly, 2005). These experiments randomly assigned a sample of welfare applicants or recipients to either a treatment group, which was required to participate in welfare-to-work programs to continue receiving the benefits, or a control group, which was not. Overall, the evidence shows a significant increase in employment and a modest increase in income among low-income adults with children. This paper contributes to the literature by studying recent SNAP policy changes that cover the entire United States. Moreover, I measure both the extensive and intensive margin responses to SNAP work requirements that affect households without children, which are the main target population of the current debate concerning work requirements.====Recently, researchers examined the labor supply effect of the SNAP work requirement using the ACS data (Stacy et al., 2018; Harris, 2021). The researchers used the age threshold of the work requirement as well as geographical variation in the work exemption across areas, with the work exemption status of an area determined using the waiver data alone. However, each year states can exempt up to 15% of their anticipated ABAWD caseload that is not covered by a waiver, and unused exemptions are carried over into the next year. I combine the waiver data with the 15% exemption data that I collected by contacting each state's SNAP agency and searching online to complete the work exemption data. This allows me to determine more accurately whether an ABAWD lives in an area that is exempt from the work requirement. I provide evidence that using the incomplete work exemption data based on the waiver data alone leads to a substantial underestimation of the effect of work requirements on SNAP receipt and an overestimation of the effect on employment (see Panel B of Appendix Table 2).====Cuffey et al. (2021) is the other exception that used the variation in 15% exemption across areas to study the effect of SNAP work requirements. However, their analysis relied on the Current Population Survey (CPS) data which has a substantially smaller sample size (100,000 addresses) than that in the ACS data (3 million addresses), and most counties, except for very large counties, are not identified in the CPS due to confidentiality issues. Using the ACS data that contains fine geographic detail allows me to generate more precise and representative estimates of the effect of SNAP work requirements.====More importantly, Cuffey et al. (2021) focused only on high school dropouts and years 2005–2009 and found a positive effect of SNAP work requirements on employment, which is inconstant with main findings from this study and other contemporaneous studies. I demonstrate that this discrepancy is explained by differences in the sample definition. When restricting my analysis to the sample of high school dropouts and years 2005–2009, I find that the work exemption has a statistically significant negative effect on employment, consistent with the results from Cuffey et al. (2021). However, when including years 2005–2017 or all education groups in the sample, the effect on employment becomes statistically insignificant (see Appendix Table 14).====It is important to note that SNAP participation is substantially underreported in the ACS data (Meyer et al., 2018). Moreover, the public use ACS data does not contain detailed information on the interview date and the birthdate for the respondents, preventing me from identifying the exact period during which the ACS respondent is exempt from work requirements. As a result, my estimates on the effect of work requirements may be attenuated due to mismeasurement of both SNAP receipt and the work exemption status of ABAWDs.====Ribar et al. (2010), Gray et al. (2021), and Mueser et al. (2019) circumvented theses measurement issue by using administrative SNAP and UI data from South Carolina, Virginia, and three states (Georgia, Missouri, and South Carolina), respectively. All three studies found evidence that work requirements substantially increase exits from SNAP among SNAP participants, though the magnitudes of the effect vary across studies. In addition, Gray et al. (2021) found a small and statistically insignificant effect on employment. While their data address measurement issues in the survey data, their estimates are based on a single or a few states. Thus, their findings may not be generalizable to other states. Moreover, their analysis sample is restricted to ABAWDs who enrolled in SNAP before changes in work requirements, which is potentially subject to selection bias.====In contrast, my analysis relies on data from all US states and the sample includes all ABAWDs who are potentially affected by the policy regardless of SNAP enrollment status. Moreover, when compared to the administrative UI data, the ACS data contains more comprehensive information about individuals’ labor market activities, which allows me to examine various margins of labors supply responses to the work exemption. I further review contemporaneous papers that examined the labor supply effects of work requirements in Section 7.7.====This paper further contributes to literature that quantifies the role of SNAP policies in changes in SNAP caseloads (Ziliak et al., 2003; Mulligan, 2012; Ziliak, 2015; Ganong and Liebman, 2018). In particular, Ganong and Liebman (2018) estimated that the suspension of the SNAP work requirement accounted for about 67% of the increase in ABAWDs’ SNAP enrollment from 2007 to 2011.==== These estimates are based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation assuming that, in the absence of the ABAWD exemption, ABAWDs would have experienced the same SNAP enrollment growth as non-ABAWDs. Using a quasi-experimental approach, I estimate that the growth in SNAP enrollment for ABAWDs from 2007 to 2011 that is attributable to the work exemption is only about 6%, suggesting that the growth in SNAP enrollment during the recession was driven primarily by economic conditions and policy factors other than the work exemption. This result is consistent with the main finding from Ganong and Liebman (2018) that the overall growth in SNAP caseloads during the Great Recession is mainly driven by the increase in unemployment rather than changes in SNAP policies, though my estimate may be attenuated due to the measurement issues mentioned above.====Finally, this study relates to previous work that examined the causes of recent declines in employment for low-skilled workers.==== One group of researchers argued that structural factors such as a decline in manufacturing industries, or an improvement in leisure technology account for the reduced employment rate among low-skilled workers (Charles et al., 2016; Aguiar et al., 2018). Another group of researchers claimed that the cause of reduced employment is associated with cyclical factors, such as the housing market crash or expansions in unemployment insurance programs during the recession (Mulligan, 2012; Mian and Sufi, 2014; Hagedorn et al., 2015; Johnston and Mas, 2018). My results suggest that the expansion of SNAP benefits during the recession contributed little to the decline in employment among low-skilled prime-age workers.",The impact of SNAP work requirements on labor supply,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712100124X,22 November 2021,2021,Research Article,136.0

They can increase the opportunity costs of education by favoring low-skilled jobs, thus making it optimal for individuals to interrupt their education. This study uses proprietary individual-level data to study the long-term effects of an oil boom on human capital in a developing country. Exploiting variation in the timing of the shock and geographic differences in the effect of exposure to the boom, I find that exposure to the boom decreased college completion, increased low-skill employment, and had limited long-term effects on ==== accumulation.","Are resource booms a blessing or a curse for a country? A priori, we would expect that natural resources should boost economic development; however, since the work of Sachs, Warner, 1999, Sachs, Warner, 2001, there is ample evidence to suggest that resource-rich countries underperform in several dimensions.==== One concern in this area is the possibility that resource booms reduce human capital accumulation. These booms are shocks that affect labor-market conditions, making low-skilled occupations more attractive and increasing the opportunity cost of education. Thus, some individuals find it optimal to drop out of high school/college and enter the workforce.====It is not clear whether these decisions to leave school are temporary or permanent. If individuals anticipate that the resource boom is temporary, they may plan to return to school at a later date. However, as time passes, life events may impose further costs on returning to school, and the time horizon for realizing the return to education decreases. Also, if agents expect that the natural resource boom will be a permanent shock, then the likelihood of returning to school decreases. These factors make it less likely for individuals to resume their education; hence, the decrease of human capital could be permanent, affecting both individuals’ living conditions and a country’s growth potential.====This paper uses proprietary individual-level data from a financial services company in Ecuador to document the long-term effects of the 1970s oil boom on educational attainment levels. I estimate the reduced form effects of exposure to this shock on college completion rates as measured 40 years after the boom. I use an intensity difference-in-differences design that compares changes in college completion rates across cohorts who turned 18 before and after 1973 (the year of the boom) to changes in college completion across different regions.====In 1972, Ecuador started oil production, and in 1974 the price of oil skyrocketed due to the Arab embargo. In Ecuador, as in many countries, the state owns all mineral rights, so the government received a massive influx of funds that it directed toward highway spending, infrastructure, and subsidies (Acosta, 2006, World Bank, 1979). These expenditures lowered the cost of starting new commerce and construction businesses, which increased the productivity of low-skilled jobs by 93 percent (World Bank, 1979a). Low-skilled workers’ real earnings increased by 18 percent following the boom, while high-skilled real earnings decreased by 8.8 percent (Palma, 1986). Consequently, employment rates in non-agricultural low-skilled jobs increased by 14.1 percentage points, compared with only 7.5 percentage points in high-skilled jobs. These shifts suggest that the opportunity cost of college increased, making college less appealing.====Ecuador’s geographic features created three sources of regional variation in terms of the effect of exposure to the oil boom. First, the oil industry is located in the Amazon jungle, an isolated region in the 1970s. For this region, the oil industry’s presence could have plausibly increased or decreased the costs of college attendance after the oil boom, thus making the effect on college completion rates uncertain. On the one hand, the new low-skill jobs created by the oil industry are concentrated in this region, increasing the opportunity cost of college. On the other hand, the oil boom led to improved connectivity with the rest of the country and spillovers from the oil industry. These factors plausibly increased the returns of education.====Second, while the oil boom was a national-level shock, the cities of Quito and Guayaquil benefited the most from the infrastructure boost driven by the boom, implying a more considerable increase in education’s opportunity cost.====The third source of regional variation relies on the fact that during the 1970s, there were only universities in five cities, and college supply was concentrated in Quito and Guayaquil.==== This situation, together with drastic altitude differences across the country that increase transportation costs, implies that people born in regions without universities faced higher costs of college attendance than people born in cities with universities. Theoretically, lower costs allow more students with lower ability levels and income to attend college. Hence, the marginal student from regions with low costs who attend college would be expected to have lower ability and income levels than the marginal student from regions with high costs. This difference makes regions with low costs more sensitive to shocks that increase low-skilled workers’ earnings. As the cities with universities also benefited the most from the infrastructure boost triggered by the boom, the total effect of exposure to the oil boom should be more noticeable in these cities than in the rest of the country.====The intensity difference-in-differences design compares cohorts who had already decided whether to go to college by 1973 with cohorts who were still in high school and thinking about whether to attend college across regions. This design obtains the change in college completion rates in regions with universities and the Amazon region against that in regions without universities, which should be the least affected by the boom.====The results show that exposure to the resource boom decreased education completion rates. College completion decreased the most in the cities where the majority of universities were concentrated. Exposure to the boom decreased college completion by 2.9 percentage points, which represents 12.2 percent of the college completion rate for those who turned 18 just before the oil boom. Robustness tests show that, if there were any confounding shock, it would attenuate the estimates.====The long-term reduction of college completion rates is consistent with a model of rational individuals who stopped their educational attainment because the increase in low-skilled workers’ earnings was large enough to compensate for the loss of human capital accumulation. Unfortunately, there is no data on earnings to test this channel directly, but I provide three pieces of evidence consistent with this dynamic. First, if the oil boom increased the returns of education in a region, then completed educational attainment should have increased there. As mentioned above, the boom had a positive effect on connectivity and local income in the Amazon region, plausibly increasing the returns of education there, and countering the effect of the availability of low-skilled jobs in the oil industry documented by Chuan (2020). Exposure to the oil boom increased college completion in the Amazon region by 4.5 percentage points (58.5 percent of the baseline).====Second, the structure of the labor market shifted toward low-skilled occupations, and this shift lasted over the long term. This shift is consistent with the dynamics documented by Gollin et al. (2016), who find that natural resource shocks drive higher employment in non-tradable services such as commerce. I find that, in the cities with full universities, exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 increased the likelihood of working informally in 2012 by 0.8 percentage points (1.9 percent of the baseline), while it decreased this probability by 1.7 percentage points (3 percent of the baseline) in the Amazon region.====Third, I find that exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 did not affect two relevant measures of wealth: homeownership (in 2010) and vehicle ownership (in 2013). The point estimates for homeownership in the cities with universities are smaller than 0.6 percentage points (1 percent of the baseline), and the confidence interval rules out effects larger than two percentage points. In addition, I find that exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 decreased vehicle ownership in these cities by 0.5 percentage points (2.8 percent of the baseline).====This study’s findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of resource booms on outcomes related to growth and living conditions. One branch of this research area documents the effects of resource shocks on educational attainment, finding that exposure to resource booms decreases high school enrolment in resource-rich areas in the short term (Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005, Cascio, Narayan, 2020) but have mixed results on self-reported completed educational attainment (Chuan, 2020, Emery, Ferrer, Green, 2012, Kumar, 2017). Other studies consider the effects of natural resource shocks on: (i) non-resource economic activity (Allcott, Keniston, 2017, Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005, Marchand, 2012, Michaels, 2011); (ii) participation in disability programs (Black et al., 2002); (iii) family income and childrens education (Løken, 2010, Løken, Mogstad, Wiswall, 2012); (iv) income levels and health spending (Acemoglu et al., 2013); (v) public expenditure, corruption, and crime (Caselli, Michaels, 2013, Street); and (vi) intergenerational mobility (Bütikofer et al., 2020).====My study contributes to this literature in three ways. First, this paper addresses data limitations that usually prevent studying long-term effects in developed and developing countries. By using administrative measures of educational attainment collected in the proprietary data, this paper controls for recall bias, social desirability bias, and other issues that affect self-reported measures of completed education. Such biases can limit our ability to detect negative effects. By addressing these issues, this paper documents that exposure to a resource boom can permanently reduce completed education, which is a new result in the literature.====Second, this paper’s results suggest that the effect of resource booms on human capital accumulation can be different between developed and developing countries. Emery at al.’s (2012) results refer to a context where 40 percent of the affected population has postsecondary education. In Ecuador, only 13 percent of the cohorts who turned 18 around 1973 have some postsecondary education. These differences translate into different labor markets, which can lead to different responses to resource booms. The Ecuadorian context shows that resource booms can have adverse effects on human capital in settings where educational attainment is low, and labor markets are oriented towards low-skilled occupations.====Third, the Amazon region’s case suggests that policy has a role in the propagation of natural resource shocks and that increasing the returns of education can counter the negative effect on educational attainment. Policymakers can encourage this policy effect by investing part of the windfall from the boom in policies that increase high-skill productivity to reduce the opportunity costs of attending college. A caveat is that these booms are large enough to drive progress in many sectors and policies in a country. Particularly in developing countries, these policies would not have existed in the absence of a boom because they depend on the windfall received by the government. Thus, the identified effect corresponds to the reduced-form effect of exposure to the boom, and the estimation strategy considers the different channels through which the boom affected the country.====Finally, in assessing the long-term effects of resource booms on educational attainment and wealth, this study joins a broader literature examining the impacts of changes in short-term opportunity costs on educational attainment levels and labor markets. Previous studies have analyzed, for example, the effects of housing booms (Charles et al., 2015), manufacturing export processing zones (Atkin, 2016), large infrastructure projects (Carrington, 1996), technological changes (Bartik, Currie, Greenstone, Knittel, 2017, Fetzer, 2014, Feyrer, Mansur, Sacerdote, 2017), and manufacturing booms, busts, and recessions (Goldin, Katz, 2007, Kahn, 2010, Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, Heisz, 2012). This paper complements this literature by documenting that exposure to a short-term resource boom can lead to a reduction of human capital in the long run by decreasing the incentives to return to school.",The long-term effect of resource booms on human capital,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001251,21 November 2021,2021,Research Article,137.0

We highlight three dimensions of heterogeneity that have previously been neglected. First, the share of tasks that can be done from home varies considerably both across as well as ==== occupations and industries. The distribution of the share of tasks that can be done from home within occupations, industries, and occupation-industry pairs is systematic and remarkably consistent across countries and survey waves. Second, as the pandemic has progressed, the share of workers who can do all tasks from home has increased most in those occupations in which the pre-existing share was already high. Third, even within occupations and industries, we find that women and workers with less stable work arrangements can do fewer tasks from home. Using machine-learning methods, we extend our working-from-home measure to all disaggregated occupation-industry pairs.","The shift to working from home has been one of the most rapid and widespread changes developed economies have seen in recent times. Catalyzed by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, this shift has exposed previously overlooked differences across workers. Most notably, differences in workers’ ability to work from home have become extremely salient. With lockdown and social distancing measures in place, telework has often been the only way for non-essential workers to carry out their work (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020, Bick, Blandin, 2020).====Given the changing landscapes of work, living and leisure, and that economic hardship of the pandemic will be related to the extent to which workers can perform their jobs from home, it is necessary to know whether workers’ ability to work from home varies systematically across ==== within occupations and industries, and whether it differs across workers by different background characteristics such as gender, education, or type of contract. Understanding how the ability to work from home is distributed across the population and jobs can help inform the design of short-time work schemes, policies aimed at re-opening the economy after the pandemic, family policies aimed promoting the ability of working parents to reconcile work and family life, and optimize commuting networks and urban planning.====We fill this gap in the literature by providing the first comprehensive analysis of heterogeneity in the ability to work from home within occupations and industries, and across workers with different characteristics. For the purpose of this study, we use three waves of data collected in March, April, and May 2020 as part of the COVID Inequality Project in two large economies, the United States and the United Kingdom (N=24,924). To capture individual ability to work from home, we ask survey respondents to state what share of job tasks they could theoretically do from home. Responses are recorded on a continuous 0–100% scale, thus allowing us to capture individual differences in the realities workers face.====Several results emerge from our study. First, we document a high degree of heterogeneity in workers’ ability to work from home. While on average respondents in the US and UK report being able to do 42% and 39% of their work tasks from home respectively, a non-negligible share of workers reports values of 0 or 100%. At the same time, the vast majority of workers report values that lie strictly between 0 and 100%, highlighting the importance of using a continuous metric.====Second, we document large differences in workers’ ability to work from home not just across but also ==== occupations and industries. We find that occupation and industry fixed effects can only account for about one quarter of the variation in the share of tasks workers report being able to do from home. Alternative measures that assume that the ability to work from home is constant within occupations or industries mask a considerable degree of heterogeneity across workers; they cannot capture the complex work realities people face. In Adams-Prassl et al. (2020b), we show that the ability to work from home significantly predicts job loss due to the pandemic ==== what can be predicted by occupation and industry fixed effects. To fully understand the economic consequences of the pandemic and how policies can help buffer the economic shocks, it is crucial to take differences across workers within occupations and industries into account.====One potential concern is that the limited explanatory power of the occupation and industry fixed effects could be explained by measurement error in our working-from-home measure. While we cannot rule out that some measurement error exists, we provide evidence from six independent surveys conducted in two countries at three different points in time to show that the variation in our metric is reliably systematic. For instance, we examine the mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and share of respondents reporting being able to do 0 or 100% of their tasks from home across occupations, industries or occupation-industry pairs, and find very high correlations in these statistics across the different countries and independent survey waves.====We further examine the distributions of our working-from-home measure within occupations and industries in more detail. Some striking patterns emerge. For some occupations, for instance ‘Architecture and Engineering,’ many respondents report being able to do an intermediate share of tasks from home and the distribution can be well approximated by a normal distribution. However, for other occupations, for instance “Office and Administrative Support”, the distribution is bi-polar, with many workers within that occupation being able to do either very few or almost all tasks from home. These patterns provide important insights for the design of labor market policies aimed at buffering economic shocks of a pandemic. Furloughing schemes, for example, typically allow workers to either keep working at 100% or to stop working altogether. Such policies may not provide enough flexibility for workers in occupations or industries in which most workers can do an intermediate share of their job tasks from home. In Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a), we provide evidence that workers in the UK who can do work tasks from home are more likely to work while furloughed, even when forbidden by the scheme. Short-time work schemes, on the other hand, might be more suitable as they allow employers to reduce workers’ hours more flexibly.====We document large differences in the ability to work from home across workers with different characteristics. Male workers, workers with a university degree, and workers with permanent contracts report that they can do a significantly higher share of their job tasks from home. Remarkably, these gaps persist even once we control for occupation and industry fixed effects.====Finally, we also consider time trends in the ability to work from home in more detail. We find that the share of tasks that can be done from home increased between March and May. It appears that this increase is mainly driven by occupations in which many workers were already capable of working from home more. Still, it remains an open question whether this increase in the share of doable tasks is fueled by firm-based technology investments, as documented by Barrero et al. (2020), or learning-by-doing of employees is an interesting open question.====The data generated as part of this project can be used as inputs for macroeconomic models that incorporate the possibility of working from home. Depending on the substitutability or complementarity of inputs in production functions, our measures can have implications for models based on a sectoral approach (e.g. Baqaee, Farhi, 2020, Bodenstein, Corsetti, Guerrieri, 2020, Brinca, Duarte, Faria-e Castro, 2020) or on an approach based on industries combined with occupations (e.g. Alon, Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey, Tertilt, 2020, Aum, Lee, Shin, 2020, Kaplan, Moll, Violante, 2020, Papanikolaou, Schmidt, 2020, del Rio-Chanona, Mealy, Pichler, Lafond, Farmer, 2020). The measures we construct can also be used for the identification of bottlenecks in production networks, as in Carvalho et al. (2020), if output differs when half of suppliers can produce all, and half cannot produce any goods, compared to the case where all suppliers can produce half of their goods.====Finally, because our sample does not cover all industry-occupation pairs, we use a machine-learning algorithm, i.e. a random forest, to train a model that predicts the mean share of tasks that can be done from home using tasks specified by the O*NET data. This allows us to expand our dataset to include almost 1000 disaggregated occupations and almost 80,000 occupation-industry pairs.====We build on and contribute to several strands of the literature. First, we contribute to the literature which assesses the feasibility of working from home for workers in different occupations using occupation-level data (see, e.g., Baker, 2020, Boeri, Caiumi, Paccagnella, 2020, Dingel, Neiman, 2020, Gottlieb, Grobovšek, Poschke, 2020, Lekfuangfu, Piyapromdee, Porapakkarm, Wasi, 2020, Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2020, del Rio-Chanona, Mealy, Pichler, Lafond, Farmer, 2020). The occupation-level indices used in these studies are primarily constructed based on O*NET data and manual classification, and line up closely with the mean shares we measure across occupations. We contribute to this work by measuring the ability to work from home at the individual level and investigating how the ability to work from home varies across and within occupations and industries, as well as across workers with different characteristics. Importantly, we also find that the mean share of tasks that can be done from home within an occupation varies systematically across industries, and the patterns are very similar across both countries. Moreover, we find that individual characteristics relate systematically to the share of tasks that can be done from home even within occupations and industries. Second, our paper relates to the literature documenting the prevalence of alternative work arrangements including telework before and during the pandemic as well as individual preferences for alternative work arrangements (e.g. Barrot, Grassi, Sauvagnat, 2021, Bick, Blandin, Mertens, 2020, Brynjolfsson, Horton, Ozimek, Rock, Sharma, Ye, 2020, Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2020, Mas, Pallais, 2017, Mas, Pallais, 2020, Oettinger, 2011). We contribute to this strand of literature by documenting the fraction of tasks workers report they ==== do from home, i.e. what would be technologically feasible. Whether workers who could work from home do so will depend on a range of different factors such as worker preferences, the cost to firms of offering different work arrangements, and government policies. Finally, our paper also relates to previous work studying the impact of working from home on productivity (e.g. Angelici, Profeta, 2020, Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015).",Work that can be done from home: evidence on variation within and across occupations and industries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001184,21 November 2021,2021,Research Article,138.0

Previous studies analyzing multiple time periods provide suggestive evidence that the wage penalty for men in same-sex couples is heading toward zero. Using data from the American Community Survey on individuals in couples from 2000 to 2019, we find no evidence that wages, earnings, or incomes of men in same-sex couples are improving relative to married men in different-sex couples. For women in same-sex couples, we see mixed evidence of convergence relative to married women in different-sex couples. The persistence of a wage penalty for men in same-sex couples is concerning in the face of anti-discrimination policies and rising overall tolerance by Americans with respect to sexual orientation.","Starting with Badgett (1995), a sizable literature examines differences in labor-market outcomes by sexual orientation. Until recently, the results from this literature have been quite consistent: lesbians earn more than heterosexual women, and gay men earn less than heterosexual men, all else equal (Klawitter, 2015; Valfort (2017); and others).====Yet society has changed dramatically since the 1990s. Same-sex marriage is legal in the United States and 29 other countries (Human Rights Campaign, 2021).==== Public opinion polls show more tolerant attitudes toward same-sex marriage and sexual orientation more generally. For example, Hansen et al. (2020b) document an increase in tolerance from 38% to 56% between 2003 and 2015 using General Social Survey data. Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, or prime minister, of Ireland from 2017 to 2020, is openly gay, as was one of the 2020 candidates for the President of the U.S. Given this increase in acceptance of same-sex couples, along with the lack of profitability in general of discriminatory practices, convergence in economics by sexual orientation seems likely if not inevitable.====Given the societal changes, including the increasing market pressures and legal protections against discrimination, is the gap in wages and earnings by sexual orientation diminishing? Klawitter's (2015) meta-analysis finds that the gap is smaller in recent studies compared to earlier studies. Badgett et al. (2021) find lower hourly wages for gay men in American Community Survey (ACS) data, with no evidence of any convergence in wages. In contrast, Carpenter and Eppink (2017) find an earnings premium for gay men in the 2013 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and they find an earnings premium for lesbians during the same time period. Using data in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 2007 on men who live alone, Clarke and Sevak (2013) find a shrinking gap in earnings for gay men relative to heterosexual men, although the difference is not always statistically significant. Similarly, the earnings disadvantage for gay men is diminishing in Canada (Dilmaghani 2017; Mueller 2014). There is no evidence of a gay earnings disadvantage in the UK in recent work (Aksoy et al., 2018).====For women, Badgett et al. (2021) find a declining hourly wage premium for lesbians in the ACS for 2000 to 2018, and Cushing-Daniels and Yeung (2009) find a declining lesbian earnings premium in the General Social Survey between 1988 and 2006, which is consistent with the UK evidence in Aksoy et al. (2018) of no earnings differences between lesbians and heterosexual women. Carpenter and Eppink (2017) document an earnings premium for lesbians in the 2013 to 2015 NHIS.====We contribute to this literature by taking a deep dive into earnings and employment by sexual orientation as inferred from relationship status (described below). First, we calculate the wage and earnings gap over a 20-year time period from 2000 to 2019, complementing recent research looking at 1988 to 2007 (Clarke and Sevak, 2013) and 2013 to 2015 (Carpenter and Eppink, 2017). Using the U.S. ACS, we have a large sample of men and women in same-sex couples, with 2400 or more full-time workers of each sexual orientation each year starting in 2005. The ACS is not without its limitations, as discussed below. The most notable is the restriction of the sample to cohabiting individuals. Consequently, like previous work looking at sexual orientation and labor-market outcomes, the analysis is descriptive and probably not causal given issues such as selection into cohabitation, employment, full-time work, and “coming out.”====Second, we create four measures of earnings, including annual wages / salaries; earnings, defined as wages / salaries plus self-employment income; annual income, defined as earnings plus unearned income such as dividends; and hourly wages. By analyzing different measures of labor-market outcomes, we study the sensitivity of the results to variations in the measure of labor-market outcomes. Here, we complement the analysis of hourly wages for ACS data from 2000 to 2018 in Badgett et al. (2021).====Third, we study the sensitivity of the results to various age ranges. We expect labor-market behaviors to be correlated with age, so we control for different times in a person's earnings’ life.====We find no evidence of convergence for men and mixed evidence for women since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). For women, the raw gaps in all four measures of earnings decline dramatically between 2000 and 2019, whereas the regression-adjusted gaps have much slower convergence. By 2019, for full-time workers, men in same-sex couples have lower wages of approximately 10% compared to married men in different-sex couples, whereas women in same-sex couples have higher wages of approximately eight percent compared to married women in different-sex couples. The gap is similar for earnings and income, but it is somewhat lower for hourly wages compared to annual wages. The gap is robust to several factors such as age ranges, sample weights, and variation in control variables.","Convergence over time or not?

Findings show that higher learning intensity aggravated IEOp due to parental resources becoming more important through support opportunities like private tuition, adapting to an intensified educational process. The effect is stronger for mathematics/science than for reading, implying the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. My findings underscore the importance of accounting for distributional consequences when evaluating reforms aimed at increasing educational efficiency and point to the role of learning intensity for explaining changes in educational opportunities influencing social mobility.","In modern societies, the general belief that, by working and studying hard, everyone has a fair chance at climbing the social ladder has been central to maintaining social cohesion and political stability. However, in an era of relatively high inequality of wealth and incomes compared to the post-war decades in most developed countries (Piketty and Zucman, 2014), an increase in the number of citizens who fear that their children could be worse off in the future (fear of ==== mobility or fear of a lack of ==== mobility) might explain rising political polarization. For these reasons, the reduction in social mobility==== is becoming an increasingly important issue when it comes to understanding recent trends of inequality within society. As education tends to be the main vehicle for ==== mobility, it is of key policy interest to analyze educational systems in terms of equality and to detect drivers of ==== in particular (as Chetty et al., 2020 for US colleges). Yet in times of public spending constraints, accelerating growth of knowledge and higher economic competition, political attention has shifted onto making a country’s educational system more efficient (Machin, 2014). In fact, reforms have started to focus on compressing educational processes, i.e. on increasing learning intensity.====This paper contributes to the issue of how the trend in intensification of education may explain decreased social mobility by analyzing the question of how increasing learning intensity affects Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp). Thus, I shift focus onto the distributional concerns and the potential unintended consequences for social mobility that arise from compressing educational processes. If, for instance, higher intensity made it harder to learn the curriculum through schooling alone, educational opportunities could become more dependent on a student’s parental support resources. In this context, I adopt the concept as illustrated by Roemer (1998), stating that society has achieved ==== if what individuals achieve regarding a desirable objective is determined by their ==== (factors over which an individual has control), instead of by ==== that are beyond individual control (e.g. sex). Thus, IEOp==== is defined as inequality in the distribution of educational outcomes that can only be attributed to ==== through either their direct or indirect (via changing ====) impact on outcomes. It is a relative measure of educational mobility.====This paper is among the first to provide an analysis of IEOp in a quasi-experimental setting that goes beyond its pure measurement. As Ramos and Van de gaer (2016) point out, the understanding of how institutions influence IEOp is still limited. Therefore, my contribution to this issue consists in providing evidence on the role of learning intensity as a relevant policy dimension that causally affects IEOp. From a social welfare perspective, it is interesting to reveal the effects of increasing learning intensity on both academic achievement and IEOp. Pareto-improvements might be realized if intense curricula proved to be an instrument to overcome the trade-off between educational spending and schooling outcomes.====To identify the causal effect of learning intensity on IEOp, I analyze an educational reform in Germany. During the last decade, Germany’s federal states shortened secondary school for the academic track (====) from nine to eight years at staggered time points between 2001 and 2008. This so called Gymnasium-8 reform (G-8 reform) reduced school duration by one year but kept the curriculum unchanged for the affected (treated) student cohorts. Due to the implementation of the reform, there were two cohorts who would finish school together while one cohort entered one year earlier than the other, leading to differences in years of schooling (9 vs. 8 years). As both cohorts had to take the same final exams in the same year, treated students had less time to learn the same material, thus experiencing higher learning intensity. This staggered introduction of the reform across federal states generates quasi-experimental variation that allows the application of a Difference-in-Difference estimation approach (DiD) to derive the causal effect of the increase in learning intensity on IEOp, comparing the respective treatment and control groups over time.====For measuring IEOp, I use Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) data to construct a representative sample of students in the ninth grade. The data include standardized test scores in reading, mathematics, and science which are comparable across time and federal states unlike grading schemes that vary with year and state (for details on the data, see Appendix A.4.1). Moreover, these data contain a rich set of family background variables which allow me to define relevant ====. I also apply a new machine learning approach to cross-validate my theory-driven choice of variables. Ultimately, IEOp reflects the coefficient of determination when regressing test scores on these ==== variables.====The analysis yields three main findings. First, the estimated size of IEOp shows that ====% of the variance in cognitive test scores can only be predicted by ====. Second, the reform-induced increase in learning intensity led to a significant rise in IEOp, by at least 10 percentage points of the explained test score variance for affected (treated) students. Given the initial size of IEOp and the fact that this paper’s IEOp measures are lower bound estimates, this corresponds to relative increases in IEOp of at least 25%. Third, the results provide some evidence for the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. In fact, less flexible skills in mathematics and science are more responsive to changes in curricular intensity. Conversely, reading competency is trained predominantly through its usage in everyday life and thus less dependent on schooling. Finally, the results can be rationalized by differential compensation possibilities for higher learning intensity depending on parental resources, specifically the capacity to finance private tuition or to provide academic support themselves. This shows that there are important distributional concerns in providing equal opportunities (cf. Andreoli et al. (2018)) that must be taken into account when designing reforms altering the intensity of educational processes.====This paper offers several contributions to the existing literature. First, I contribute to the strand of research on measuring Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) with respect to educational outcomes by adding empirical evidence on how Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp) has changed over time in a developed country. So far, papers dealing with IOp have focused on measurement issues, using income as the main outcome variable (e.g. Almås et al. (2011)). Concerning IOp in educational outcomes, most studies focus on measuring IEOp for developing countries (e.g. Gamboa and Waltenberg (2012)). The few papers on developed countries mostly follow a cross-country comparison approach using PISA data to achieve comparability of educational achievement measures over time and across countries (e.g. Ferreira and Gignoux (2013)). Instead, my study estimates IEOp for Germany exploiting quasi-experimental within-country variation (as Cantoni et al., 2017 for China). Such settings allow going beyond measuring IEOp to actually estimate the causal effects of specific policies on IEOp. For instance, some studies analyze IEOp in the context of reforms that changed tertiary education systems (e.g. Brunori et al., 2012 on Italy). They find that both expanding higher education through opening more sites as well as reducing the length of getting a first-level degree to have a positive effect on Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEOp). However, only a few studies investigate the impact of school reforms on IEOp (e.g. Edmark et al., 2014 for Sweden). In this paper, I add evidence on how IEOp changed over time in Germany and focus on estimating the causal effect of increasing learning intensity on IEOp for the academic track in the secondary school system.====Second, this work contributes to a strand of the literature analyzing educational policy reforms to identify the underlying role of different input factors in the human capital accumulation process. Even though the G-8 reform shows that changing school intensity is an important consideration in educational policy-making, research on such reforms is still limited. To begin with, empirical work has analyzed the effects of variations in pure schooling quantity without considering learning intensity. In that context, most studies focus on reforms that increase educational participation, such as policies raising compulsory minimum duration of schooling. They usually find the returns of additional schooling on earnings to be positive (e.g. Aakvik et al. (2010); Angrist and Krueger (1991); Eble and Hu (2019); Grenet (2013)). Furthermore, the impact of differences in instructional time on academic performance has been investigated. Relying on either cross-national or within-country variation in instructional time, most studies find a positive impact of additional time on standardized test scores (e.g. Aksoy and Link (2000), Marcotte (2007), Lavy (2015)). However, only a few studies have analyzed the impact of variations in instructional time when curricular content can be assumed to remain constant. In this context, reforms that shortened the duration of schooling while keeping curricular content unchanged allow for evaluating the impact of increasing learning intensity. For instance, analyzing a similar school reform in parts of Canada, Krashinsky (2014) finds only small long-term effects on wages. This suggests that increased learning intensity might not affect earnings permanently.==== The results are in line with Pischke (2007), who exploits a German reform in the 1960s that changed the start of the school year to autumn by implementing two short school years. The reform led to a significant increase in the number of students repeating a grade, but only small effects on earnings persisted.====Despite the resulting public controversy that has even led some federal states to reverse the reform, only a few studies have evaluated the G-8 reform and its effects on educational outcomes====. Additionally, the findings of those studies vary depending on the chosen educational outcome measure. For instance, Huebener and Marcus (2017) find that the reform had, on average, a significantly negative effect on the grade point average (GPA) of students. In contrast, the reform tends to have a positive effect on cognitive test scores as measured by PISA data (see, e.g. Huebener et al. (2017)). Furthermore, the results of Marcus and Zambre, 2019 indicate that the reform led to falling enrolment rates at university. Moving away from the explicit effect on direct educational outcome variables, the analysis in my paper shifts focus in the evaluation of the G-8 reform onto distributional concerns. In other words, I evaluate whether the reform is ====, i.e. it decreases IEOp while maintaining at least test score results, or ====, i.e. it increases IEOp (Checchi, van de Werfhorst, 2018). In particular, my findings are relevant for policy suggestions on designing curricula that take the effect of learning intensity on both cognitive skill formation and IEOp into account. Implementing a whole-day school system, for instance, might limit the necessity for parents to help students deal with compressed schooling curricula.====Thirdly, my paper relates to the emerging literature on finding drivers of inequality in educational outcomes which are key determinants of recent trends in decreased social mobility (e.g. Boneva and Rauh (2018); Chetty et al., 2020; Philippis and Rossi (2019); Rothstein (2019)). I contribute to this strand of research by providing evidence that the previously neglected factor of learning intensity might be a relevant policy channel for both the effectiveness of (non-)cognitive skill formation and the importance of ==== for educational outcomes. While my analysis mainly focuses on exploiting a school reform to derive causal estimates on how intensified instruction affects IEOp, the interpretation of these results in terms of potential mechanisms complements explanations delivered by this most recent strand of literature. Although a complete model of learning intensity, IEOp, and its connection to social mobility is beyond the scope of this study, I provide evidence on which future research tackling this big picture question can base itself. This also supports the integration of learning intensity as a key factor into the human capital literature.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the institutional background and the G-8 reform on which the identification strategy relies. Section 3 explains how IEOp is measured given the data in this study. In Section 4, the empirical strategy is illustrated. Section 5 provides the results with robustness checks and a discussion on their implications.

The country liberalized their trade policies in the early 1990’s and experienced an increase in trade values as a direct result. However, Brazil’s trade values began to increase at an even higher rate in the early 2000’s, which corresponds to China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Brazil’s reliance on trade with China has consistently increased since. In 2000, Brazil’s imports from China and exports to China accounted for approximately 2.2% and 2.0% of Brazil’s total imports and exports, respectively. By 2010, nearly 14.9% of Brazil’s total exports and 13.5% of its total imports were to or from China.==== Brazil also experienced rapid economic growth throughout the decade, including substantial gains in employment and wages. Labor market gains were widespread, impacting both males and females, but females often experienced larger gains (Silva et al., 2015). Previous research indicates that Brazil’s trade liberalization, an import-driven trade change, impacted males more than females (Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017), and that trade can improve women’s role in the labor market (World Bank and World Trade Organization, 2020). It is a natural extension of the existing literature to study whether the China trade shock also had differential labor market effects by gender.====In this paper, I analyze the impact of the China trade shock on gender-specific local labor market outcomes in Brazil to determine whether increased trade with China played a role in Brazil’s expanding labor market, and gendered effects, during the 2000’s. The analysis combines Census data for Brazil with CEPII BACI trade data for the years 2000–2010. I use (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) instrumental variable approach, which builds upon Autor et al. (2013)’s original strategy by controlling for worldwide trends, to isolate the impact of both increased imports from China and increased exports to China on male and female local labor market outcomes in Brazil. Brazil experienced a surge in exports to China slightly larger than the surge in imports from China.==== Thus, analyzing the effects of both trade flows with China for the case of Brazil is necessary to fully capture labor market responses to increased trade with China. I analyze gendered local labor market outcomes in various sectors of the economy, focusing on the traded, nontraded, formal, and informal sectors. This is in line with Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017, who emphasize the importance of looking beyond the manufacturing and/or traded sectors to determine the full picture of the impacts of trade, particularly when considering differential effects by gender.====This paper contributes to several branches of the trade and labor literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the rise of China by examining the impact of both imports from and exports to China on local labor market outcomes in a fellow emerging country. This area of research was pioneered by Autor et al. (2013), who introduced a unique instrumental variable strategy to isolate the effects of trade with China. I build upon early studies in this area by analyzing labor outcomes across all sectors of the economy, broken down by gender, rather than focusing on outcomes for all workers in the manufacturing or traded sector. This is particularly important when focusing on gender in Brazil as evidenced by the relatively low share of female employment in the traded sector. Second, this paper contributes to the smaller area of research on the labor market effects of trade in Brazil specifically. Several studies analyze Brazil’s trade liberalization and subsequent labor market dynamics,==== but (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) were the first to study the China trade shock in the context of Brazil. The authors tweaked Autor et al. (2013)’s instrumental variable strategy to account for the worldwide commodity price boom during the 2000’s and studied the effects of the supply and demand side of the China trade shock on local labor market outcomes. I directly build upon (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) study by disaggregating labor market effects by gender and broad sectors that capture the full Brazilian economy. This is necessary to study labor market outcomes by gender since men and women often segregate into different sectors of the economy. I also explore potential mechanisms behind the observed differences by gender, including occupation segregation, to better understand how different groups of workers are impacted by trade shocks.====Thus, this paper also contributes to the literature on the distributional effects of trade. There are a few papers specific to Brazil that are particularly relevant. First, Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017 found that men experienced larger impacts than women in response to Brazil’s trade liberalization, noting that trade likely has gendered effects since firms often view men and women as imperfect substitutes in the labor market. I extend the basic idea behind Gaddis and Pieters to the more recent China trade shock, focusing on both import- and export-induced labor market dynamics by gender to determine whether the China trade shock contributed to Brazil’s rapid economic growth during the 2000’s, which was larger for females on average. Second, there are two recent papers specific to the China trade shock in Brazil. Benguria and Ederington (2017) study the distributional effects in response to imports from China with a focus on the gender wage gap. Similarly, Paz and Ssozi (2021) study the impact of Chinese imports on the share of female employment and the male-female wage gap, exclusive to the manufacturing sector. The authors find that Chinese import penetration is associated with: (1) reductions in the gender wage gap, which stem from an increase in the share of females in high-paying occupations (Benguria and Ederington, 2017), and (2) increases in the share of female employment and declines in the male-female wage gap in the manufacturing sector (Paz and Ssozi, 2021).====I build upon this prior work by analyzing the relationship between both imports from and exports to China in the formal, informal, traded, and nontraded sectors. This approach allows me to capture the full picture of the gendered impacts of the China trade shock in Brazil rather than the dynamics within a single sector, which are often not representative of both men and women in the labor market. I also use the more recent instrumental variable strategy of (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) to control for worldwide trends over the time period, such as the commodity price boom. Further, I build upon prior work by analyzing the direct relationship between both trade flows with China and a formal index of occupation segregation and its two components. Changes in occupation segregation can stem from two different dynamics: changes in the relative size of occupations (occupation composition), and/or changes in the gender dynamics in occupations from females entering male dominated occupations, or visa versa (gender composition).==== It is necessary to study both an index of occupation segregation, and its two components, to fully understand the dynamics between trade and occupation segregation. This is an understudied, but important area of research on the gendered impacts of trade, as occupation segregation is a leading contributor to persistent gender gaps (Anker, 1997, Blau and Hendricks, 1979).====Brazil provides an interesting context to study the gender-specific impacts of the China trade shock for several reasons. Brazil experienced substantial labor market growth during the decade, particularly for women while also increasing their reliance on trade with China. Previous research indicates that trade can induce productivity and employment increases (Harrison, Hanson, 1999, Muendler, 2004), lead firms to employ more women in developing countries, and decrease labor market disparities between men and women (World Bank and World Trade Organization, 2020b). Historically, Brazil has a large informal sector and high levels of labor market inequality. This means it is possible that Brazil’s increased trade with China contributed to economic growth during the time, and led to differential labor market effects across genders. Brazil’s trade pattern with China is also consistent with trade patterns for several other emerging and developing countries (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016); therefore, findings on China’s impact on gendered local labor market outcomes in Brazil could also apply to other developing and emerging countries with similar trade relationships with China. As the world continues to globalize and countries become increasingly interconnected through international trade, it is important for policy makers, scholars, and the general public to understand more about the winners and losers from trade, particularly for various subgroups of the population.====There are several potential reasons to expect increased trade to have gender-specific effects. International trade increases the level of competition domestic firms face, which theoretically reduces firms’ ability to discriminate in hiring practices (Black and Brainerd, 2004). Second, trade can also induce technical change. If technical change is skill-biased, then some research indicates that skill-biased technical change can have gender implications. As firms upgrade their technology, the substitutability of female and male workers can increase (Juhn et al., 2014).==== The third reason for gender-specific effects of trade relates to labor market segregation and reallocation. Males and females often segregate into certain occupations or industries within an economy. For Brazil, females are most represented in the non-traded and informal sectors, which suggests that the impacts of trade could likely be stronger for males in the traded sector or the formal sector (Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017). Last, traditional trade theory predicts that globalization induces structural change in production, which leads to a reallocation of productive factors, including labor. If male and female workers are not perfect substitutes, then this reallocation can have gender implications (Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016, Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017).====The results indicate that the China trade shock did have gendered local labor market effects in Brazil and support two mechanisms: the pro-competitive effects of trade reducing labor market discimination and labor market segregation and reallocation. Microregions more exposed to imports from China experience negative wage impacts, or slower wage growth, while microregions more exposed to exports generally experience positive wage impacts, or faster wage growth. The import-induced wage declines are particularly pronounced in the formal and traded sectors and wage losses in these sectors are significantly larger for males than females. Increased exposure to Chinese imports also reduces wages in the nontraded sector, but the losses are significantly larger for women. In contrast, export-induced wage increases are larger for women than men in the nontraded and formal sectors. Overall, trade with China has stronger wage impacts on the workers most connected to trade, and wage effects are typically larger for the gender most represented in each sector. This supports the idea of labor segregation presented in Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017, who found Brazil’s trade liberalization had stronger impacts for men in the traded sector. The results also confirm Benguria and Ederington (2017)’s finding that import-induced wage declines in the formal sector are larger for men than women, but the results further highlight the impacts of both channels of trade with China on gender-specific wages beyond the formal sector.====Import-induced wage declines are coupled with substantial employment growth for both men and women in the formal sector, but the employment gains are significantly larger for women. This result supports (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) finding that trade with China is associated with increased formalization of the Brazilian labor market; they also further reveal that women benefit from increased formalization significantly more than men and illustrate the differential impacts for men’s and women’s employment across sectors that are representative of the full Brazilian economy. The simultaneous increase in employment and decline in wages associated with imports from China are consistent with an increase in labor supply, particularly since formal employment gains are only coupled with small employment losses for men in the nontraded sector. Additional analyses reveal that imports are associated with a significant increase in the employment to population ratio for women, and lower unemployment rates for men and women. Increased trade with China leads women to reallocate from non/unemployment to employment in the formal sector and men to reallocate from the nontraded sector and unemployment to the formal sector.====As labor reallocates, this translates to a pareto optimal increase in the share of female employment in the formal sector. To the extent that women were initially held back or discouraged from certain employment, this change may reflect improvement in labor market discrimination in response to trade with China. Formal employment has known benefits and securities guaranteed to workers, so these gains are also economically significant. Further, import exposure also decreases occupation segregation in the formal and traded sectors, which signals improvement in the percentage of women that must change occupations for the distribution of males and females within occupations to equal one another. This is a particularly important finding in the formal sector as the change in occupation segregation stems from improvements in gender composition, while changes in occupation composition actually work against this finding and increase the level of occupation segregation. This complements Benguria and Ederington (2017)’s finding on the association between imports from China and reductions in the gender wage gap via increases in the share of females in high-paying occupations. The results also further highlight the competing dynamics of changes in the relative size of occupations and changes in the gender composition of occupations in response to trade across sectors representative of the full economy. The occupation segregation findings lend additional support to both mechanisms. Trade with China clearly impacts labor segregation and reallocation and is associated with reductions in labor market barriers and discrimination in Brazil. The reductions in labor market discrimination are limited to employment and occupation segregation, and do not translate to improvements in the average wage ratio. There is little evidence that trade with China impacts workers differently by education level, a proxy for skill, which doesn’t support the skill-biased technical change mechanism. Overall, this paper highlights how trade shocks differentially affect men and women in the labor market, which is important for researchers to consider in the future, particularly when determining the winners and losers from trade.====This paper proceeds as follows.

We develop an empirical model for educational correlations within the family in which parental educational sorting can translate into intergenerational transmission jointly by both parents, or transmission can originate from each parent independently. Estimating the model using educational attainment from Danish population-based administrative data for over 400,000 families, we find that on average 75 percent of the intergenerational correlation in education is driven by the joint contribution of the parents. We also document a 38 percent decline of assortative mating in education for parents born between the early 1920s and the early 1950s. While the raw correlations also show decreases in father- and mother-specific intergenerational transmissions of educational attainment, our model shows that once we decompose all factors of intergenerational mobility, the share of intergenerational transmission accounted for by parent-specific factors increased from 7 to 27 percent; an increase compensated by a corresponding fall in joint intergenerational transmission from both parents, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged. The mechanisms of intergenerational transmission have changed, with an increased importance of one-to-one parent-child relationships.","Understanding the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status is key for the design of policies aimed at promoting equal opportunities. Since Becker (1973), parental human capital has been considered to be the engine of intergenerational transmission of advantage.==== Parental assortative mating in education – the tendency for individuals with the same education to mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern – can also affect intergenerational transmission by generating segmentation in the distribution of parental human capital. This segmentation results in an increasing share of households characterized by high (or low) levels of human capital for both parents, so parental sorting can act as an amplifier of intergenerational persistence in human capital (Doepke et al., 2019).====In this paper, we study the contribution of parental educational sorting to the intergenerational transmission of human capital. We develop an empirical model of educational correlations within the family in which human capital of parents is generated by factors shared between parents due to assortative mating, some of which can be fully transferred to children, while other factors are not passed on to children. In addition, each parent may transmit human capital independently to their children due to factors that are not shared with the co-parent. Therefore, in our model intergenerational persistence can arise both from the joint contribution of the parents and from the independent contributions of each parent.====We estimate the model using educational attainment from Danish population-based administrative data for over 400,000 families. Identifying the contribution of parental assortative mating to the intergenerational transmission of human capital is achieved by exploiting ==== composed of two parents and two children. We find that about 75 percent of the intergenerational correlation in education is driven by the ==== of the two parents, while the ==== from each parent is only one sixth of the size of the joint parental contribution, with father-specific transmission being larger for sons, and mother-specific transmission being larger for daughters. This pattern suggests that most of the persistence in educational attainment is due to factors that both parents share and transmit to their offspring.====Exploring trends over time, we document that parental assortative mating in Denmark has declined by 38 percent for parents born between 1920 and 1952.==== While the raw correlations also show decreases in father- and mother-specific intergenerational transmissions of educational attainment, our model shows that once we decompose all factors of intergenerational mobility, the share of intergenerational transmission accounted for by parent-specific factors increased from 7 to 27 percent. This increase in parent-specific intergenerational transmission reflects a corresponding fall in joint intergenerational transmission from both parents, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged. The nature of intergenerational transmission is changing, with a growing importance of one-to-one parent-child relationships.====This finding about the nature of intergenerational transmission can, in part, be explained by the increase in the time parents have been spending with their children over recent decades in Denmark and across other western countries, especially on activities enhancing child human capital potential with an increasing involvement of fathers (e.g., Sandberg and Hofferth, 2001; Sayer et al., 2004; Guryan et al., 2008; Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla, 2012; Sani and Treas, 2016). The composition of parental time with children has also changed with the emergence of intensive parenting, including activities in which both parents spend time together with their children (joint family time) but also activities in which children are spending time with only one of the parents (Craig et al., 2014).====This paper relates to a growing literature in economics on the relationship between assortative mating and intergenerational transmission. One strand of the literature focuses on educational sorting in the ====, taking the view that non-random sorting among offspring might affect measures of intergenerational mobility, slowing down regression to the mean in socioeconomic status between parents and children (e.g., Chadwick and Solon, 2002; Ermisch et al., 2006; Holmlund, 2020).====Another strand of the literature, which is closer to our study, examines the effect of sorting in the ==== on the socioeconomic status of the offspring generation. Although this literature has mostly focused on inequality (e.g., Fernández and Rogerson, 2001; de la Croix and Doepke, 2003, Fernández et al., 2005; Bratsberg et al., 2018), the influence of parental sorting on intergenerational mobility may be even more important than on inequality (e.g., Kremer, 1997). Nevertheless, the empirical evidence on the link between parental sorting and intergenerational mobility is still limited. Among the few existing studies, Güell et al. (2015), exploit the joint distribution of surnames and economic outcomes and provide evidence of a decrease in intergenerational mobility in Catalonia throughout the 20==== century, suggesting the increase in assortative mating to be an important driver of this secular fall in intergenerational mobility. Collado et al. (2019), exploit extended families to infer the characteristics of multi-generational transmission and find a predominant role of assortative mating for explaining intergenerational persistence.====The empirical model of educational correlations within the family that we develop in our study contributes to this literature in three ways. First, we decompose parental assortative mating into intergenerational and intragenerational components, where only the former contributes to parent-child educational correlations. Second, we quantify how much parental assortative mating contributes to intergenerational persistence relative to factors that are passed on to children from each parent independently from the co-parent. Third, we trace out how the components of educational correlations within the family have evolved over time.====The time evolution of the relative importance of joint versus parent-specific contributions is also related to the literature documenting the evolution of assortative mating, which concludes that changes in assortative mating over time have a limited impact on overall income inequality (e.g., Eika et al., 2019; Frémeaux and Lefranc, 2017). We contribute to this literature by showing that the impact of the declining importance of assortative mating for intergenerational transmission observed in Denmark is compensated by countervailing trends in parent-specific transmission of education to children, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged.====The approach we propose in this paper is not without limitations. Most importantly, although it is intuitive to allow for joint versus parent-specific transmission of human capital, we cannot identify all the factors that can account for this distinction. Differences in parental time allocation and its evolution over time is one among several possible explanations. The model also focuses on overall trends of assortative mating without allowing for differences in marital sorting across educational groups; trends that have been found to differ both within and between countries. Our proposed model offers a decomposition of intergenerational persistence and assortative mating in education that complements other approaches in the literature.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we describe the data source and provide a summary of raw statistics on the extent of intra-family correlations in education. In Section 3 we outline the econometric model of educational correlations of family members, while in Section 4 we present the estimation results. In Section 5 we provide a concluding discussion.",Parental assortative mating and the intergenerational transmission of human capital,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000828,8 August 2021,2021,Research Article,143.0

It has been shown by other researchers that most entrepreneurs who are successful started firms in their mid-40s, but what about those founders who are under the age of 35 and are running 42% of all new firms? How successful do they become, and what factors are consistent with their success? Using newly available data from Denmark on firm sales from 2001 to 2016, this paper shows that young founders who become serial entrepreneurs see their sales revenues nearly double between their first and second firms. Commensurate with this sales increase are two underlying factors: (1) young founders become more inclined to register new firms as limited liability corporations (LLCs), which protects them from personal losses if the firm fails; and (2), young founders who are the most successful are portfolio founders, or those who keep their first firms open when they found their second firm. Furthermore, for small firms, the productivity of the firm is often also the productivity of the founder, so just as the personal productivity of wage earners rises with age over their lifecycles, so too does the personal productivity and implied income of young entrepreneurs.","Both policymakers and the general public are very interested in what makes for successful entrepreneurship. The general public hears and reads a great deal about entrepreneurship, following well-known figures like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, and Sir Richard Branson as though they are inspirational and intellectual leaders. Policymakers follow entrepreneurs because, going beyond the general public, they wish to craft policy tools that foster entrepreneurial growth. And finally, it is important to note that entrepreneurs themselves, or those hoping to become entrepreneurs, are very interested in learning about what makes a great entrepreneur.====There is, not surprisingly, a voluminous literature on entrepreneurship, aimed at identifying the traits of successful entrepreneurs. Thus, one must ask, what will this paper add to that literature? The literature has focused largely on the personal traits of entrepreneurs and less so on the successes of their businesses.==== That is, researchers have looked at who becomes an entrepreneur and his/her motivations for doing so, not so much at what accounts for their success. This latter omission was driven to a considerable degree by a lack of data in the past. By and large, good data on entrepreneurial success has only become available fairly recently====Our goal is to determine what factors are important in making a young person a successful entrepreneur. A founder is said to be successful when his or her firms have high sales, growing sales, or are highly productive. We use Danish data, which has been used previously to study other facets of entrepreneurship, but we focus on the sales of young firms over many years. We match to these sales data the personal traits of founders and their families. We will be following firms from all industries, not just high-tech firms, for 2001-2016. We also go back to 1990 to define who is a serial entrepreneur.====Our specific goals are to follow young entrepreneurs as they age, to compare the more successful entrepreneurs to their less successful counterparts, and to draw limited conclusions as to why some are much more successful. In anticipation of one key conclusion, one indicator of success is whether the young person becomes a serial entrepreneur, because serial entrepreneurs have higher sales than novice entrepreneurs, who are those who run only one firm. Our results are then interpreted, addressing whether serial entrepreneurs appear to be a select group of people, or whether the decision to open a second firm is endogenous to the first firm's success. In following young serial entrepreneurs, a second indicator of success is whether he or she evolves from running a first firm as a sole proprietorship (SP) to running a second firm that is an incorporated LLC firm. The LLC protects the founder from incurring personal debts and thus encourages risk-taking. And with family background data, we test whether a family history of entrepreneurship leads to running LLC firms.====Our data is observational data – entrepreneurship is rarely studied in an experimental setting since it cannot be randomly imposed.==== Therefore, we will make clear the econometric challenges that we face and the limitations of our conclusions. One methodology we use is person fixed effects to follow the success of serial firms, holding fixed the innate unobserved quality of the founder. We also have a rich set of firm and personal characteristics, to interpret our results. Finally, we introduce firm fixed effects to follow the growth of firms as founders age. For novices who run only one firm, the growth of that firm is their way of succeeding.====Given the focus on young entrepreneurs, we look to the literature on age and entrepreneurship, which is also quite large. Azoulay, et al. (2020) most recently show that most successful entrepreneurs found their companies when they are in their mid-40s. The hypothesis that successful entrepreneurs start later in life has been addressed in the past, but Azoulay, et al. (2020) have better data, using U.S. LBD data containing 2.7 million observations on founders for 2007-2014. Others who have looked at age effects have also pointed out that very young people found firms less often than those closer to age 40.==== Even when the focus of a research paper is not on age, the age implications surface. For example, Chen (2016) has good data on serial entrepreneurship and shows a very clear quadratic pattern in the effects of age on success.====Though it has been shown elsewhere that the average age of founders is in their 40s, we show that the founder who starts young can achieve the same, or even greater, success because the young founder invests in himself and in his firms. This paper watches these young entrepreneurs grow and improve over time, even though the average successful entrepreneur is middle-aged.====Since we aim to follow the evolution of young entrepreneurs as they age and as their firms grow, we want to permit small-firm entrepreneurs to enter our data, and therefore we require a broad definition of an entrepreneurial firm. We define an entrepreneur as a person who runs a firm that has a minimal level of revenue liable to the Value Added Tax (VAT). We include SPs but exclude “hobby firms” that don't have revenue or employees.====Another reason we use the broadest possible definition of entrepreneurship is that governments making policy decisions to support entrepreneurship, like in U.S. and Europe, care about the founders of small firms. For example, entrepreneurs who run small firms in the U.S. may sell their products through Etsy, which is a website that offers a huge range of products made by people who craft each product individually. Also, these small-firm entrepreneurs may be raising money for themselves through Kickstarter, which is a website that allows people to request and aggregate very small amounts of money from a lot of people.====From a traditional economics literature perspective, we are essentially estimating age-earnings profiles by following the implied earnings of young entrepreneurs as they age. Our measure of success is the revenue and productivity of their firms, not personal wage income, but the growing productivity of firms translates into growing incomes for their founders. Whether wage or entrepreneurial income, income is growing in a concave profile with age: wage-earners move to higher paying firms with age and entrepreneurs open second firms or grow their first firms. Also, the large and long-standing literature on traditional age-earnings profiles, based on wage income, has made clear the issues of selectivity and endogeneity that hamper clear conclusions, and those issues are relevant here. At the end of this paper, we will return to the traditional age-earnings literature to briefly draw analogies between what we have learned and what others learned.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical and empirical frameworks for the regressions to be estimated. Section 3 describes the data and presents descriptive statistics. Section 4 displays data distributions of sales for different subgroups that we study later. Section 5 estimates the basic sales and productivity regressions, with Section 6 introducing tests for growing sales with age. Section 7 examines the gains to incorporation, and also the growing incorporation rates with age. Section 8 adds information on family background, to see how families might shape the success of the young. Section 9 shows that success in sales for all subgroups of firms depends on having a small number of firms with enormously high sales, an outcome that policymakers want when they encourage founders to start firms.

Here we ask how those reforms affected the educational attainment of youths who were teens at the time those reforms took place. We take a difference-in-difference approach, following adolescents from two generations roughly 20 years apart. In each generation, we compare two groups, one which was more likely to have been affected by safety-net reform, and one which was less likely to have been affected. Under some assumptions, our approach identifies the joint, or bundled, effects of the constituent policy changes that make up safety-net reform. We find evidence that safety-net reform may have reduced educational attainment for women, and had small positive effects on education for men. We offer suggestions as to why our findings differ from those of previous studies of the components of safety net reform.","The U.S. safety net was extensively revamped in the 1990s. After a period of experimentation by the states, federal welfare reform replaced the cash transfer program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) program, in 1996. Congress expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) over the period 1994-1996, raising wage subsidies available to low-wage workers. Changes to the Medicaid program, which began in the 1980s, continued during the 1990s to extend health coverage to children in low-income families.====An important question is, how did these reforms affect the educational attainment of individuals who were adolescents at the time the reforms were enacted? This question is important for policy purposes, since the goal of policy makers was to change the safety net in ways that would have long-term effects on U.S. society. It may also have important implications for trends in inequality.====Several authors have analyzed how specific reforms have affected the schooling of individuals who were adolescents at the time when the reforms were passed. Dave et al. (2012) and Kaestner et al. (2003) analyzed how welfare reform affected dropout behavior. Maxfield (2013), Bastian and Michelmore (2018), and Manoli and Turner (2018) estimated the effect of EITC expansions on educational attainment. The effect of Medicaid expansions on college attendance has been studied by Cohodes et al. (2016), Miller and Wherry (2019), and Brown et al. (2020).====Whereas previous authors have sought to estimate the effect of specific programs, our goal in this paper is to estimate their joint effect, that is, their effect as a bundle. One reason is that we might expect the effects of those programs to interact. For example, a healthier adolescent may be better able to take advantage of additional parental expenditures on her schooling.====Another reason is that there are at least two channels by which the reforms could have affected individuals who were adolescents at the time they were put into place. The first we refer to as the resource channel. This includes the effects of the reforms on program services, parental time spent with children, and parental income, which in turn could affect the adolescent’s ability to afford post-secondary schooling. The resource channel has been the implicit focus of previous work, as we discuss below. We would expect males and females to be similarly exposed to the resource channel, since they grow up in the same families.====However, safety-net reform may have also affected those adolescents via their expectations about the future, including their expectations regarding future safety-net benefits and eligibility. Heckman et al. (2002) present a model that predicts that early-career wage subsidies may reduce human capital investments that are rivalrous with work. Thus expectations of future wage subsidies could reduce schooling. Studies that focus on the resource channel may miss the expectations channel. In contrast to the resource channel, we would expect the expectations channel to affect males and females differently, since in the pre-reform regime, women were much more likely than men to receive safety-net benefits.====We take a difference-in-differences (DD) approach to estimation, comparing two groups across two generations of adolescents. The pre-reform generation consists of the 1961-1964 birth cohorts of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). This generation was aged 11-15 in 1975, and in their 30s by the time of safety-net reform. The post-reform generation comes from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), whose members were born between 1980 and 1984. This generation was aged 10-15 in 1995, in the midst of the 1994-1996 EITC expansions and just before federal welfare reform. Members of this generation would have been affected to varying degrees by the Medicaid expansions, as well.====Within each generation, we define a treatment and a comparison group. The treatment group consists of individuals whom we predict to be at high risk of economic disadvantage during adolescence. We show that this group has characteristics similar to those of groups at high risk of welfare receipt in the mid 1990s. As a result, they should have been affected by safety-net reform. The comparison group consists of individuals at lower risk of adolescent disadvantage, who would have been less affected by safety-net reform.====The logic of differences-in-differences here is straightforward. The contrast between the high- and lower-risk groups in the pre-reform generation establishes the baseline difference in their educational attainment prior to safety-net reform. Differencing across generations nets out changes over time in factors that influence schooling which affect both groups similarly. If safety-net reform were the only factor that affected the two groups differently, then the DD approach would identify the bundled effect of the various safety-net reforms. This would include the effects of any interactions as well as effects that arise via resource and expectations channels.====Of course, other factors may have affected schooling trends as well. These include differences in the U.S. economy as faced by the two generations as they finished high school. We expand on the basic difference-in-difference approach by adding various macro- and socio-economic controls to account for these factors.====Our focus here is on educational attainment at age 25. We consider years of schooling, high school graduation, sub-baccalaureate degrees, and college graduation. We find that safety-net reform may have reduced educational attainment for women, while increasing it for men. Women obtained fewer years of schooling, were less likely to graduate high school, and less likely to obtain a post-secondary degree. However, although all these effects were in the same direction, they were marginally significant. In contrast, men were significantly more likely to obtain a post-secondary degree.====To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first estimates of the bundled effects of safety-net reform on schooling. Our findings for women differ from those of some earlier studies, which focused on the resource channel for specific safety-net programs. To help explain these differences, we analyze annual enrollment and labor supply between the ages of 18 and 22, when most people who attend college would be enrolled. We find that young women are less likely to be enrolled and more likely to work during this period as a result of safety-net reform. This is particularly true for young women with children. As we explain below, this may be consistent with the notion that the expectations channel led to the reduction in human capital among women. In a follow-up paper (Bastian et al., forthcoming), we build on these results, and examine how these changes in human capital affected employment, safety-net participation, marriage, and childbearing up through age 32.====In the next section of the paper, we provide more background to motivate our question and briefly discuss the various safety-net reforms. After discussing the data in the following section, we elaborate our empirical approach. A key to our DD analysis involves constructing our treatment and comparison groups, which in turn involves predicting the risk of adolescent disadvantage among the members of our sample. We discuss how we predict risk and how we construct the risk groups. The approach involves a number of decisions whose effect on our results is impossible to gauge ====. We discuss the specification-curve approach to inference of Simonsohn et al. (2020), which allows us to draw inferences across the multiple specifications that result from those decisions. Section 4 also presents our results, which show that safety-net reform increased men’s schooling, although it may have reduced it among women. It also provides evidence on employment and enrollment behavior. Section 5 discusses the role of resource and expectations channels and offers suggestions for why our results run contrary to recent studies that have analyzed individual components of the safety net.",How Did Safety-Net Reform Affect the Education of Adolescents from Low-Income Families?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712100066X,13 July 2021,2021,Research Article,146.0

We start by developing a theoretical model of a hierarchical firm, where gender representation in top organisational layers can affect gender-specific hiring and ==== probabilities at lower layers. We then exploit a recent French reform that imposed gender representation quotas in the boards of directors and test the model’s predictions in the data. Our empirical results show that the reform was successful in reducing gender wage and representation gaps at the upper layers of the firm, but not at lower firm layers. A Panel VAR analysis confirms that the trickle-down effects of this policy were limited and suggests that quotas targeting middle management, rather than corporate boards, may have a more widespread effect across the firm.","Gender differences in labour force participation, education and political participation have narrowed in recent decades. Despite these significant advances, gender disparities in the labour market remain large.==== This is particularly evident in top leadership positions, where women continue to be severely under-represented and where gender wage gaps remain substantial. To address these issues, many European countries such as Norway, Italy, Belgium and France have passed laws introducing gender quotas in the corporate boards of directors of publicly-listed firms.====In this paper, we investigate if greater female representation in top management positions raises relative female employment and wages in the rest of the firm. In other words, does having more women with decision-making power at the top of the firm hierarchy lead to improved outcomes for women further down the firm hierarchy?====To answer this question, we first construct a stylised model of statistical discrimination. We model firms as organisations with distinct hierarchical layers. Within each layer individuals perform tasks that vary in complexity. Hiring and promotion decisions for the individuals in each layer are taken by managers higher up in the firm hierarchy. Managers only have imperfect information about potential candidates since their skills are only partly observed at the point of making these decisions.====We introduce gender differences by allowing agents in the model, i.e. workers and their managers, to be one of two types: male or female. Following the recent work of (Flabbi et al., 2019), we assume that female managers assess the skills of other females with greater precision compared to male managers. Under the plausible assumption that profits from a worker-job match are concave in workers’ skills, our model predicts that female managers are relatively more likely to hire and promote female candidates. Consequently, a greater share of women in a given layer increases the share of women hired and promoted in the adjacent subordinate layer, which in turn affects the next layer below. As such, the impact of higher female representation at the top of the firm on gender gaps may trickle down the firm hierarchy. The extent of these trickle-down effects is determined by exogenous job turnover and promotion rates within firms.====We then test our model’s predictions empirically by estimating the effect of the share of women on corporate boards on gender gaps at each layer of the firm hierarchy using French administrative data. To do so, we exploit a 2010 reform imposing gender quotas on corporate boards in France. This law, called the ====, mandated publicly-traded firms to have at least 20==== women on the board of directors by the 1st of January 2014 and 40==== by the 1st of January 2017.==== Firms that failed to comply with the reform would have been fined, dissolved or banned from paying existing directors. Crucially, the implementation of the ==== generates instruments for the share of women on corporate boards, which is likely endogenous. Following (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012) and (Bertrand et al., 2018), we instrument the shares of female board members using the share of female board members in 2010, the year prior to the implementation of the reform. The intuition behind our instrumental variable strategy is simple: companies that started with a lower share of women on their board have had to increase their share of women relatively more to comply with the quota.====We find that, consistent with the predictions of our model, a rise in female board membership (layer 1) narrows gender wage and employment gaps at the top layers of the firm, namely among senior executives and professionals (layer 2) as well as among middle management (layer 3). For instance, an increase in the share of women on corporate boards by 10 percentage points (pp) has a statistically significant effect of raising the share of women by 2.4 and 2.5 pp in layers 2 and 3 respectively. In addition, it lowers the gender wage gap in layer 2 significantly by approximately 2.4 percent.====In our analysis of the reform period, we find that no statistically significant impact is observed on gender and representation gaps at the lowest layer (layer 4), which comprises of administrative, sales, security and blue-collar workers. To explore the extent of trickle-down effects to lower layers in the long term, we run a panel vector auto-regression analysis (P-VAR) on our data from 1999 to 2016. We find that even over a ten-year period, an increase in female board share has limited trickle-down effects on the lowest layers of the firm. A counterfactual exercise using the estimates from our P-VAR suggests that an increase in the share of women in middle management (layer 3) would have a greater impact on gender gaps at the lowest layer of the firm. As such, while corporate board quotas do mitigate gender gaps at upper layers of firms where these gaps are widest, other policies should be considered if the aim is to improve the labour market outcomes of a broader section of women.====We make two main contributions in this paper. First, we construct a theoretical model, which formalizes how an increase in female representation at the top of the firm hierarchy can affect gender-specific outcomes such as gender wage gaps and representation gaps at lower layers. Second, we contribute to the literature by studying the impact of gender quota reforms on gender-specific outcomes at each hierarchical layer of the firm. Previous literature has highlighted that these changes have no statistically significant effects at the firm level. In contrast, we show that changes in gender quotas improving female representation at the top of the firm hierarchy have differing effects on gender-specific outcomes across the lower layers of the firm hierarchy.==== A growing literature has focused on the role of female leadership in determining labour market outcomes for females, albeit with little consensus. One strand of this literature has identified a positive impact of female leadership on labour market outcomes of women. For instance, Cornell and Welch (1996) find that women in general are likely to be more sensitive to the issue of gender representation, discriminate less and be able to better assess their female co-workers relative to men. In the corporate setting, authors including (Cardoso and Winter-Ebmer, 2010), Bhide (2019), Cardoso and Winter-Ebmer (2010) and Kunze and Miller (2017) have found a general positive impact of female leadership on the wages and representation of female subordinates. A similar literature in political economy has discussed the positive impact of female political leadership on gender bias (e.g. Beaman et al., 2009 and Gagliarducci and Paserman, 2012).====On the other hand, Adams and Funk (2012) have presented evidence showing that women that do break the glass ceiling and make it into top management positions might behave as their male counterparts and may not necessarily have a positive impact on female labour market outcomes. Likewise, recent evidence from academic committees shows that having a higher share of women can have a negative effect on the probability that a woman is hired (Bagues, Sylos-Labini, Zinovyeva, 2017, Deschamps, 2018).====We contribute to this on-going literature, both theoretically and empirically, by examining if a greater share of women on corporate boards significantly mitigates gender wage and representation gaps in firms. At a theoretical level, our work contributes to two strands of the literature. First, our model borrows from the literature on internal labour markets (e.g. Pastorino, 2015) and from papers studying the role of female leadership in determining the gender-specific outcomes of subordinates (e.g. Flabbi et al., 2019). Specifically, Flabbi et al. (2019) propose a signal extraction model where employers have incomplete information about workers’ productivity, which is in turn influenced by their gender. They assume that executives are better-equipped to assess the skills of employees of the same gender. This is in line with recent works in the socio-linguistic literature (e.g. Canary et al., 2009 and Scollon et al., 2011) and survey evidence (e.g. Angier and Axelrod, 2014 and Ellison and Mullin, 2014) suggesting the presence of communication frictions between men and women at work. We adopt a similar framework in this paper. However, in our model, we allow for different managerial layers within firms and for the dynamic evolution of the gender composition in each layer. This helps us to endogenise potential trickle-down effects induced by changes at the top of the organisation on gender gaps across the rest of the firm hierarchy.====Second, our work relates to a recent strand of the literature aimed at explaining the internal organisation of firms, the formation of hierarchies within firms as well as the assignment of workers across firm hierarchies (see Caliendo, Monte, Rossi-Hansberg, 2015, Garicano, Van Zandt, 2012 and references therein). Yet, this set of papers has so far abstracted from the role that organisational structure has to play in determining gender-specific outcomes within firms. We complement this literature by exploring the role that organisational hierarchies play in propagating gender gaps.====At an empirical level, our work relates to the literature examining the role of female representation on the board of directors on firm-level gender outcomes, exploiting two similar board quota reforms (see Bertrand et al., 2018 for Norway and Maida and Weber, 2019 for Italy).==== Both these papers use a similar identification strategy, originally employed in (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012), and find no evidence of spillover effects on the representation of women at the top on women in the rest of the firm.==== We contribute to this strand of literature by distinguishing the effect of this policy at different hierarchical layers within the firm. In particular, we conjecture that since corporate board members are more likely to interact with workers at the upper layers of the firm hierarchy, the impact of board quota reform should be more pronounced at these upper layers. Furthermore, not only does the framework of internal firm hierarchies allow us to distinguish the differing effect of the policy on the top and the bottom layers of the firm but it also facilitates predictions on the trickle-down effects of such a reform.==== The rest of the article is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present the administrative data used in the paper. In Section 3, we describe the reform. In Section 4, we present our theoretical model. Section 5 introduces our empirical strategy and displays our empirical results.

As a result, it may have reached misleading conclusions regarding the optimal tax structure. The recent work on labor supply that I review here emphasizes ==== and the participation margin. When the data is viewed through the lens of models that account for these features, it implies labor supply is more elastic than conventional wisdom suggests. Recent work also stresses how elasticities vary by age, education, gender and marital status. Here I explore the implications of these recent developments in the labor supply literature for the optimal design of the tax system. I also review some recent work in the optimal tax literature that does utilize more sophisticated labor supply models, and discuss how incorporating those features influences optimal tax calculations.","Recent work on labor supply has extended traditional labor supply models to account for investment in human capital over the life-cycle, which renders wages endogenous to the labor supply decision. It has also emphasized the important distinction between labor force participation and labor supply intensity (i.e., hours) decisions. This work suggests that labor supply elasticities may be significantly larger than has been assumed by the conventional wisdom of the economics profession (see Keane and Rogerson, 2012, 2015). More generally, recent work on labor supply emphasizes how labor supply elasticities vary systematically over the life-cycle for individuals, as well as across demographic groups.====Optimal tax theory suggests that labor supply elasticities are crucial inputs into the design of the tax and transfer system. But the implications of recent work on labor supply for the optimal design of the tax and transfer system has received limited attention. My goal here is to discuss the implications of recent labor supply modelling for the optimal design of the tax and transfer system, and to suggest important avenues for future research on this topic. As a by-product I update my survey in Keane (2011) to cover the past decade.====Two key points are worth highlighting: First, there is a fairly broad consensus in the economics profession that low tax rates on capital income are desirable. However, we'll see how two results characteristic of recent labor supply modelling – the combination of elastic labor supply and elasticities that grow with age – imply that the optimal tax rate on capital income may be higher than previously supposed. Second, both elastic labor supply and endogenous wage formation (via human capital formation) shift the optimal tax structure towards relatively flat-rate structures with low top rates on labor income. It is interesting that these two implications push in opposite directions politically.====Turning to the heterogeneity in labor supply elasticities across demographic groups, a clear finding is that labor supply is very elastic for married women (see, e.g., Eckstein et al., 2019, Eissa, 1996). But the joint taxation of couples in households has a strong tendency to impose high effective tax rates on married women. Several recent papers point to a clear conclusion that a shift from joint to individual taxation would be welfare enhancing, and that it would lead to substantial increases in married women's labor supply.====The outline of the paper is as follows: First, I give some background on optimal tax theory and review some classic papers on optimal tax structure. Then I discuss more recent developments, focusing in particular on the work by Conesa, Kitao and Krueger (2009) that clarifies the role of labor supply elasticities in optimal tax calculations. Their paper shows how elastic labor supply and elasticities that increase with age both encourage a high tax rate on capital. Hence, I review in turn the evidence on elastic labor supply and the age pattern of elasticities, and argue it supports both claims. Next, I consider optimal tax calculations that explicitly account for endogenous human capital and/or participation. Finally, I turn to the topic of heterogeneity in labor supply elasticities across demographic groups, and show how the evidence on this topic argues for the efficiency of individual taxation.====To conclude, I highlight some gaps in the existing literature. The empirical evidence on how labor supply elasticities differ by age is still rather limited, although the evidence that does exist suggest they are increasing. Given the importance of this issue for optimal tax structure, much more work on this topic is needed. Theoretically, the frontier in the optimal tax literature is to use dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with overlapping generations of heterogeneous workers to study optimal tax structure – both income and capital tax – in models that include (i) Endogenous wages, (ii) Participation Decisions, (iii) Workers that differ by education, and (iv) both single workers and married couples. While existing papers tackle a subset of these problems no one has tackled all of them.",Recent research on labor supply: Implications for tax and transfer policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000610,24 June 2021,2021,Research Article,148.0

We identify servitization as being a main driver of increasing within-establishment wage inequality. Servitization accounts for roughly 7% of the observed increase in the within-establishment wage inequality in ","In this paper, we examine the effect of servitization on within-establishment wage inequality. We define servitization as the increase in the share of workers with service occupations in total employment within establishments. For our analysis, we use disaggregated German matched employer-employee data covering the years from 1994 to 2017. The time period is not only marked by pronounced shifts in the labor composition at the establishment level toward workers in service occupations. We also observe distinct wage growth and dispersion of wages across different occupation-skill groups and an economy-wide increase in wage inequality by approximately 12% during the period of observation.====We find that establishment-level servitization explains about 7% of the observed establishment-level increase in wage inequality in the manufacturing sector during the 1994 to 2017 period of observation. The current paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to identify establishment-level servitization as an additional cause of increasing wage inequality. Increasing wage inequality is the result of underlying heterogeneous wage responses by occupation groups as the occupational composition of establishments changes towards a higher share of service occupations. While servitization causes a lower wage level for otherwise identical workers in almost all occupations, the wage decrease is particularly pronounced for low-skilled manufacturing workers and workers at the lower end of the wage distribution. For instance, wages for low-skilled workers with manufacturing occupations fall on average by 11% as the result of an increase in the establishment’s service share by one standard deviation. Wages of workers in high-skilled manufacturing occupations decrease by merely 3%. Generally, the effects are more pronounced in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector.====Our paper is motivated by three stylized facts: (i) Structural change at the sectoral level has been identified as one of the main drivers of wage inequality. Blum (2008) reports that changes in the sectoral composition account for approximately 60% of the relative increase in the wages of skilled workers between 1970 and 1996. (ii) Recent research has shown that structural change is not only a sectoral phenomenon but also occurs at the firm (and even establishment) level.==== In Germany, the share of service workers in the manufacturing sector increased by approximately 28% during the 1994 to 2017 period. In 2017, nearly 36% of the workers in the manufacturing sector held service occupations (Boddin and Kroeger, 2021a). (iii) As we show in the current paper, the lion’s share of wage inequality occurs within rather than across establishments. We show with a variance decomposition that 79% of residual wage variance occurs within establishments. It is thus natural to ask whether servitization drives establishment-level wage inequality.====This paper contributes to the growing literature on wage inequality and its underlying causes in industrialized economies and in Germany in particular (cf. Dustmann et al. (2009) and Card et al. (2013) for seminal contributions). These studies report an increase in the wage dispersion which can partly be explained by changes in the labor composition within firms and assortative matching processes between workers and firms. Other potential causes of increasing wage inequality at the aggregate level include increasing trade and offshoring opportunities as well as automation.==== Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2017), for instance, document that outsourcing contributes to about 9% of the increase in overall wage inequality for Germany since the 1980s.====Recently, within-firm inequality has gained increasing attention. For the United States for instance, Song et al. (2019) attribute a third of the increase in income inequality between 1978-2013 to within-firm developments. For Korea, Kim and Konings (2019) show that a substantial share of wage inequality originates from within-establishment differences. Larger firms and those owned by international business groups exhibit higher inequality than smaller firms. For the UK, Mueller et al. (2017a) and Mueller et al. (2017b) find that within-firm wage inequality increases in firm size, mainly because larger firms pay higher wages for employees at higher skill or hierarchy levels. For Germany, Antonczyk et al. (2010), Felbermayr et al. (2018), and Baumgarten et al. (2020) show that a large part of wage inequality stems from within establishments, a finding we confirm and build on here.====So far, there are few studies that consider drivers of within-firm wage inequality even though it has been shown to have significant economic implications on workers’ performance and firms’ outcomes. Barth et al. (2012) show how performance pay may lead to within-firm wage inequality. Heyman (2005) studies how within-firm wage dispersion affects white collar workers’ wages. He finds that higher within-firm wage dispersion is associated with higher pay for workers in white collar occupations. Within-firm wage inequality that is not clearly associated with productivity differences across workers has adverse effects on firms’ output (Breza et al., 2018).====As one potential driver of within-firm wage inequality, Smeets and Warzynski (2008) assess wage inequality between hierarchy levels within firms. Friedrich (2020) shows that recent trade shocks affected hierarchy structures within firms and hence the labor composition. This is associated with an increase in within-firm wage inequality. For Norway, Barth et al. (2020) show that the implementation of industrial robots raises within-firm wage inequality through higher wages for high-skilled workers relative to low-skilled workers. We add to this literature by establishing the firm’s labor composition as an important source of within-firm wage inequality, thereby connecting research on wage inequality to recent studies on structural change.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data. We then present stylized facts on wage inequality and wages in Germany in Section 3. Section 4 introduces our empirical strategy and documents the effects of servitization on establishment-level wage inequality and, subsequently, on wages of occupation groups. Section 5 concludes.

Using the computerization supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS) we show that different occupations were computerized at different times, older workers tended to start using computers with a delay compared to younger workers, but computer use within occupations converged to the same levels across age groups eventually. That is, there was a temporary knowledge gap between younger and older workers in most occupations. Using this variation, we estimate how this knowledge gap affected older workers’ labor market outcomes using millions of observations from the CPS, and additional data from the Health and Retirement Study. Our models control for occupation and time ==== and in some models, we also control for full occupation-time interactions and use middle aged (age 40-49) workers as the control group. We find strong and robust negative effects of the knowledge gap on wages, and a large, temporary increase in transitions from work to non-participation. These results are consistent with a model of creative destruction in which the computerization of jobs made older workers’ skills obsolete in birth cohorts that experienced computerization relatively late in their careers. We find larger effects on females and on middle-skilled workers.","Technological progress in the past few centuries has had an enormous impact on the labor market, shifting workers between occupations and sectors and changing the types of tasks workers are required to do. Even though it has been frequently argued that machines may eliminate human jobs altogether “rendering the population redundant”====, the labor force has been able to adapt to all these new technologies and employment-to-population ratios did not change much in the past. In fact, technological progress overall benefitted the society by increasing workers’ productivity and wages and requiring workers to do less repetitive and strenuous work. The transitions, however, may not always have been easy for workers with specialized skills that suddenly became obsolete or not competitive with new machines or other workers. The transitions were likely most difficult for older workers, who had accumulated more specialized skills compared to their younger peers and who expected to spend a shorter time on the labor market to benefit from adopting the new technologies. When an older worker experiences the obsolescence of her skills, she may decide to retire earlier than she originally planned.====In this paper we focus on a particular innovation: computerization, arguably the most important technological change of our era, and we estimate how it affected the labor market outcomes of older workers during the last 35 years from a longitudinal perspective that emphasizes the potential mismatch between the computer-related skills possessed by workers and the skills needed to carry out the tasks demanded by employers of workers in those occupations. Our main research question is: “How has the advance of computer technology and the introduction of personal computers (PCs) and the Internet since the 1980s affected the decisions of older workers about retirement and the length of working life in those occupations that use computers most intensively relative to workers in less computer intensive jobs and why?” We define the state of computer technology broadly to include the current capabilities of existing types of hardware (e.g., mainframes, PCs, mobile phones); software including word processors, spreadsheets, statistical programs, graphics programs; storage including floppy disks, hard drives, cloud; internet bandwidth; connectivity and communication through the internet, etc.====Over time the astounding increases in CPU speed, storage capacity and communication speeds has enabled a proliferation of ways of producing new and existing products and services which, in turn, has had major effects on the distribution of employment and wages across occupations. Autor et al. (2003) argue that these changes stem from the fact that worker productivity depends on the set of tasks required by their job and that the productivity of computers and software depends on the tasks that computer routines can be programmed to carry out. The impact of computerization on the distribution of employment and wages depends on both supply-side effects on worker productivity and demand-side factors that influence own- and cross-elasticities of demand for labor of each type.====Computerization affected birth cohorts at different part of their life cycles. We define “Retiree Cohorts” as those birth cohorts who were first affected by computerization on the labor market, after they finished their formal education. By 2017 people who had reached age 65 and thus were eligible for both Social Security and Medicare benefits were born in 1952. These people reached high school graduation at age 18 in 1970 at a time when mainframe computers were just beginning to be used for scientific and accounting work in large organizations. This implies that nearly all Americans born before 1952 who were observed to retire before 2017—that is, nearly all Americans who have ever retired—finished their high school degree before computerization became a significant influence in the job market. In addition, as we show in this paper, the introduction of the IBM PC in 1982 and shortly after by the Internet was associated with an acceleration of computer use at work and home. This cohort perspective implies that the human capital developed by these Retiree Cohorts during their education and early careers may have been poorly suited for jobs that required the use of computers. Facing competition from younger cohorts, we show that members of the Retiree Cohorts who did not learn to use computers in occupations in which computer use was prevalent suffered wage decreases which reduced their incomes and the marginal value of work. In effect, computerization was a form of creative destruction that imposed a loss of the value of human capital on members of the Retiree Cohorts, likely lowering the capital value of the lifetime earnings of the Retiree Cohorts through obsolescence of their human capital, while creating new opportunities for younger cohorts.====To our knowledge, the literature on the growing inequality of wages and the polarization of the job market has not addressed the implications of computerization for the labor market and retirement behavior of older workers.==== However, the analysis in this paper is related to a wide range of theoretical and empirical literature in labor economics on inequality and polarization of occupations, education and wage.====In the empirical part of this paper, we first track the fraction of workers who used computers and the Internet at work and at home between 1984 and 2017 in detailed occupation and age groups, using the computerization supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). We measure the size of the computerization shock by the gap between the fraction of younger and older workers in a given year and occupation who used computers at work. We show that this “====” tended to be larger in highly skilled occupations that were computerized earlier, but importantly it was temporary, and it largely disappeared by 2017, as computer use among older workers and younger workers converged. We made this knowledge gap measure available online and it can be merged to other datasets.====We hypothesize that the knowledge gap signaled a pressure on older workers at the time to either adopt the new technology or to leave these jobs or the labor market altogether. Then we test how the knowledge gap affected the labor market outcomes of older workers at the time when it affected their own occupation and birth cohort using millions of observations from the CPS, and additional data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our empirical models use time-series variation in computerization for identification. A growing recent literature has used occupation measures, based on the O*NET or the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), to study how workers’ job characteristics affected their labor market outcomes. These measures, however, only provide cross-sectional variations based on the workers’ occupations. We, instead, directly control for skill and time fixed effects in our models. These specifications hold workers’ skills constant and compare birth cohorts that were affected by computerization at different times in their careers, while controlling for general economic conditions with year fixed effects.====We find strong evidence that computerization (i.e. the knowledge gap) temporarily shortened the working lives of older workers and it decreased their wages. The main results of the paper are robust to many methodological assumptions, such as the definition of “skills,” the type of control groups, or the use of control variables. We also look at other outcomes, such as transitions into less skilled occupations, and into part-time jobs; or being depressed. Finally, we also carry out detailed subgroup analysis, to understand if the effect of computerization varied by demographics (such as gender) or job types. Our paper starts in Section 2 with a brief overview of the history of computerization and the relevant economic theory about how it may affect retirement. Section 3 introduces the CPS and the HRS datasets that we use in this project. Section 4 presents our main empirical results, and Section 5 concludes.","Computerization, obsolescence and the length of working life",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000403,24 May 2021,2021,Research Article,150.0

The program intended to make the teaching profession more attractive by raising wages for skilled teachers and taking advantage of teachers’ professional competence. Our results show that: (i) high-wage teachers are more likely to be promoted; (ii) the stipulated wage increase has full pass-through onto wages for promoted teachers; (iii) schools with promotions have lower teacher separations and an improved pool of teachers. These results suggest that performance-based promotions could be an important tool for raising teacher quality.,"Good teachers are an important input to schooling.==== Still, most teacher labor markets are characterized by problems to recruit and retain talented teachers (Bacolod, 2007, Corcoran, Evans, Schwab, 2004, Fredriksson, Öckert, Grönqvist, Vlachos, 2016, Leigh, Ryan, 2008). The compressed wage distribution—relative to other occupations—is often put forth as a primary driving force behind these problems, pointing to a greater need for policy-makers to find ways to tie the pay structure more closely to teacher quality.====There are several ways to make teacher compensation more responsive to teacher skills (see Jackson, 2012 for a discussion). In this paper we study how the teacher labor market is affected by improved career opportunities, taking advantage of a unique promotion program for Swedish teachers. In response to deteriorating results in international comparisons like PISA and TIMMS, the Swedish government introduced a career step for experienced and skilled teachers by providing separate funding for a new position called ‘career teachers’ (Regeringen, 2013b). Career teachers receive a substantial monthly wage increase (5000 SEK (520 USD), which corresponds to nearly 20 percent of mean pre-reform wages) and continue to teach, but are also tasked to work with the school’s pedagogical development, like being a mentor or initiating and leading development projects (Statskontoret, 2015a).====The intention of the program was to improve student outcomes by motivating, retaining and attracting high quality teachers (Regeringen, 2013b). While similar types of career steps also exist in England, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Poland (Regeringen, 2013c), we know little about their impact on teachers and students.====Due to budgetary constraints, the career teacher reform was rolled-out over four years, and the number of career teacher positions increased gradually. School districts could apply for funding for the career teacher positions, which was allocated in proportion to student population. School districts had discretion to assign career teacher positions to individual schools within the district, and at the schools it was delegated to the local principals to identify and recruit skilled teachers to the new position.====In a descriptive analysis of who was promoted, the most salient pattern is that promotions within schools were given to teachers from the higher wage deciles of a compressed wage distribution, conditional on observable teacher characteristics and school fixed effects. We also show that promoted teachers received the stipulated wage increase. Thus, the reform increased wage dispersion both across and within schools, and there is no indication of compensatory behavior towards non-promoted teachers in regular wage negotiations.==== We then address two central questions: Is there an effect of the career step on teachers’ separations from their school, and from the profession overall, and is there an effect on the composition of teachers?====Because most school-districts participate in the reform from the start, we estimate the impact of the new career opportunities using school-level variation, rather than school district-level variation, in the appointment of career teachers in a difference-in-differences strategy that compares school-level outcomes in schools that have at least one career teacher to schools that do not (never or yet) have career teachers. An empirical challenge with our approach is that school districts have autonomy over the allocation of career teacher positions across schools and we lack information about their assignment rules. Our main identifying assumption is that the ==== of the introduction of career teachers across schools is unrelated to trends or school-level shocks that affect teacher separations. In line with this assumption, we show empirically that no observable factors beside the number of students systematically influence schools’ timing of the introduction of career teachers within school-districts. Thus, even if school districts were free to allocate the promotions across schools, they did not target the promotions to schools with, for example, high teacher turnover or low student performance. To further assess the validity of the identifying assumption, we also perform an event-study analysis to rule out pre-participation trend differences in wages and separation rates between teachers in promoting and non-promoting schools. Finally, we show that our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks, including specifications that account for school-district-level trends and shocks through school-district by year fixed effects.====Our results suggest, once schools introduce career teacher promotions, there is a reduction in teacher turnover, both in general and in terms of teachers leaving the profession. This result is driven mainly by more senior teachers and applies both to teachers who were promoted and to those who were not promoted. In addition, the teaching pool improves in schools that participate in the reform as they are able to retain a higher share of certified and experienced teachers and teachers who themselves have higher compulsory school grades.====Our findings contribute to the policy debate about how to improve school quality by tightening the link between teacher pay and performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first assessment of the effectiveness of performance-based promotions. Most of the previous literature has focused either on smaller bonus programs (e.g. Clotfelter et al., 2008) or general salary increases (e.g. Falch, 2011, Figlio, 1997, Gilpin, 2012, Hendricks, 2014, Leigh, 2012). Two recent studies consider the impact of changes from fixed to more flexible pay schemes. Biasi (2021) finds higher effort and teacher quality in school districts in Wisconsin that start to pay high-quality teachers more, compared to districts retaining more rigid pay schemes. In contrast, Willén (2021) finds no support for changes in teacher composition or student outcomes when individualized wage setting was introduced to teachers in Sweden in the 1990s.====Besides providing mixed results, these studies highlight the difficulties for policy-makers to achieve a widening of the wage distribution through more local autonomy over teacher pay.==== The promotion program we study is different from these flexible pay reforms in several aspects: First, the stipulated wage-increase is financed by earmarked funding from the central government, putting no strain on the local budget. Second, it restricts the number of teachers that can be promoted, preventing principals to raise wages for everyone. Third, the promoted teachers partly have new responsibilities, which could make differential pay seem more acceptable. Consistent with this notion, we find that nearly all school districts chose to participate in the promotion program and that the reform had the intended first-stage impact on the actual wage distribution.====Finally, drawing on survey data for around a third of the school districts, we are able to shed some light on how the impact of the promotions vary with the local design of the career teacher positions. These results suggest that the local design matters, in that teaching development appears more important than coaching and mentoring in reducing school separations and exits from the profession. Hence, our results indicate that increasing pay alone may not be enough to get the desired impact on teacher selection.====The paper proceeds as follows. It begins by describing the career teacher reform and the data in Section 2. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, and Section 4 presents results on how the career teacher reform impacts teacher turnover and teacher composition. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

We consider, as a measure of influence, monthly RePEc rankings and address the dynamics of rankings within the top group as a function of age. We find that the rankings peak at age 60 or 30 years after Ph.D. ====. Differently from other leaders, current and future Nobel laureates do not experience deterioration of the rankings if their works and citations are discounted by recursive impact factor, and their ranking with respect to the breadth of citations across fields improves at old age.","The measurement of scientists’ productivity as a function of age dates back at least to Dennis (1956). Scientists accumulate experience, reputation, and a professional network, but their productivity decreases because of age-related factors (Barrett and Riddell, 2016, Desjardins and Warnke, 2012, Green and Riddell, 2013, Skirbekk, 2004).==== Young scientists stand on the shoulders of their older counterparts but are healthier, strongly incentivized, easily adopt new technology and methods, and are likely to generate novel concepts (Weinberg and Galenson (2019)).====However, influence is not the same as productivity. Although scientists become less innovative as they age, the number of their papers in highly cited journals and among highly cited papers continues to rise (Cui and Zhong, 2013, Gingras et al., 2008, Rauber and Ursprung, 2008).==== Thus, it may be asked whether the influence of scientists reflects the Matthew effect of accumulated advantage, where “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer” (Allison et al., 1982, Ek and Henrekson, 2019), or whether it reflects a non-monotonic trend.====The question in this paper is what does the average relationship between age and influence of leading economists look like. Our motivation is beautifully illustrated by the example of Gary Becker. Fig. 1 shows Becker’s publications and citations by year of publication and by year of citation. Becker had three particularly productive periods in terms of the number of publications: in his mid-40s, in his early 60s, and in his late 70s. The most frequently cited papers were published during the first of the three peaks. However, the number of citations took off only when he was in his 60s.====Becker (1962) predicted that “The next few years should provide much stronger evidence on whether the recent emphasis placed on the concept of human capital is just another fad or a development of great and lasting importance.” The human capital theory was motivated by the contemporary economic growth (Weiss (2015)), but the rise of its influence was also affected by external factors, i.e., emergence of high-quality microdata and cheap computational power, which led to the development of structural econometric methods and from there to an enormous body of empirical work based on Becker’s theory.==== Accordingly, Becker received the Nobel Prize in 1992 at age 62.====The external factors that can explain the time lag between Becker’s most influential publications and their citations do not apply to all leading economists. Yet arguments with respect to the effect of external factors are made in Jones and Weinberg (2011), who write that “age creativity relationship varies substantially more over time than across fields,” in Chiappori and Levitt (2003), Jones et al. (2014), Azoulay et al. (2010), and in Reschke et al. (2018). Moreover, Aizenman and Kletzer (2011) find that although deceased authors lose potential citations (an observation that shows that citing is a strategic decision), influence of Fischer Black and Amos Tversky soared posthumously, indicating the role of external factors.====Our second observation comes from comparison between disciplines. In Fig. 2, we compare Nobel laureates in economics to Nobel laureates in physics and literature. The horizontal axis is the age at the time of receipt of the Nobel (the figure considers prizes awarded from 1990 to 2019). The vertical axis for laureates in economics and physics is the number of years since Ph.D. graduation and for laureates in literature it is the number of years since publication of the first book. The figure shows that the distribution of ages at the time of receipt of the Nobel varies across disciplines. All Nobelists in economics except Esther Duflo were at least 50 years old. Nobelists in literature had a similar age range as economists but a wider range of experience. By contrast, a significant number of Nobelists in physics were younger than 50 and had less than 20 years of experience, even if some Nobelists in physics were very old, including the oldest person ever to receive the prize. In this sense, economists are more similar to writers than to physicists. In our context, the lack of young Nobelists in economics indicates uncertainty about the influence of economic research. This observation refers to the discussion in Friedman (1953) about similarity (and dissimilarity) of economics and physics, which is essentially the question whether economics is “story telling” rather than a positive science. What makes the reference to Friedman’s essay even more intriguing is the fact that it was published fifteen years before the Nobel prize in economics was even established. Yet decades of Nobel Committee’s decisions perfectly fit Friedman’s hypothesis.====Our research design departs from the dynamics of influence within a closed group of leading economists. The approach is to consider the overall influence as a constant term that is distributed between top authors. We aim at the identification of the intergenerational competition. We employ to this end a rich and systematic database of RePEc==== monthly rankings. We estimate the gradient of the rankings with respect to age when we control for individual fixed effects and autoregression of the residuals.====RePEc calculates the 37 rankings from its data on citations, publications, journal pages, abstract views, downloads, scientific network, and number of students. The citations and the publications are measured by a set of indices, which use different weighting schemes along the quantity / quality/ coauthorship/ time lag dimensions. Constrained by the RePEc policy of publishing explicit rankings of only top 5% of its members, the agents that we analyze are economists that are continuously included in this group. Yet this group is not small. The largest possible (in terms of ====) balanced panel that can be constructed from these data consists of 1,335 economists who are ranked over 100 months.====We find that the relationship of rankings with age follows a U-shape, where the lowest point indicates the best ranking. This “optimal” age is 60, which corresponds to around 30 years after Ph.D. graduation.==== Therefore, our results indicate that a twenty-year lag between peak of productivity, which is around age 40 (Cui and Zhong, 2013, Gingras et al., 2008, and Rauber and Ursprung (2008)), and peak of influence, discussed above for the case of Garry Becker, is the average pattern among leaders.====In the empirical analysis, we distinguish between Nobelists and other top RePEc members. The Nobel Prize is an external recognition of the scientist’s “unquestionable” influence (Hirsch (2005)), independent of RePEc. It is therefore not easy to find a proper comparison group for the Nobel laureates. A natural comparison group would be the nominees who did not win the prize (Baffes and Vamvakidis (2011)), but this data is released with a 50-year lag. Therefore, we take an advantage of the fact that in RePEc data, Nobel laureates can be consistently compared to top non-Nobelists.==== We find that differently from other leaders, current and future Nobelists do not experience a U-shaped relationship of age with rankings for indices of the number of works and citations discounted by recursive impact factor. That is to say, the marginal effect of age on their rankings does not deteriorate with age. Moreover, for breadth of citations across fields, the marginal effect of age on Nobelists’ rankings improves with age.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data and provide descriptive statistics. In Section 3, we describe the estimation procedure. In Section 4, we present the results.

This paper quantifies the importance of the key determinants of job interestingness for the first time. It also explores the reasons why there are much fewer interesting jobs in Japan than in other high-income countries (H). Decomposition analyses are performed using the International Social Survey Programme and Japanese panel survey data. In both H and Japan, interest match and prosocial meaning of the job are two of the three most important predictors of job interestingness. The third top predictor is job ==== in H, whereas in Japan it is relatedness (relationship with management and colleagues), implying that the most effective ways to make a job interesting vary across cultures and work organizations. The largest factor explaining the job interestingness gap between Japan and H is Japan's lower level of job autonomy, although promoting autonomy is a less effective way to enhance job interestingness in Japan.","Interest is an important psychological state and a motivational disposition (Renninger and Hidi, 2016: 8). It can “spark and maintain intrinsic motivation” and initiate and maintain engagement (O'Keefe et al., 2017: 49).==== In educational psychology, it is well known that interest promotes learning and improves academic performance (O'Keefe et al., 2017: 57). In workplace, recent vocational psychology literature shows that vocational interests (the match or “congruence” between individual interest and work environment, in particular) are positive predictors of task and training performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and job satisfaction, and negative predictors of labor turnover (Nye et al., 2019). In the Online Appendix B of this paper, I present original empirical evidence of job interestingness being positively associated with job satisfaction, intention to continue working in the current organization, intention to work harder to help the organization succeed, actual working efforts, and mental health (Appendix B1).==== It also shows that the predictive power of job interestingness is relatively large.====Although job interestingness benefits both workers and firms, the proportion of workers who find their job interesting varies greatly across countries. In particular, Japan is marked with fewer interesting jobs than other high-income countries. Based on the International Social Survey Programe (ISSP) data averaged over 1997, 2005, and 2015, the proportion of workers who agree that their job is interesting is 77.5% in nine high-income countries (H), but only 54.0% in Japan (Fig. 1).==== Similarly, the proportion of workers who ==== that their job is interesting is higher in Japan (20.3% in Japan vs. 8.6% in H). The average 5-point scale job interestingness score is lower in Japan (3.47 in Japan vs. 3.95 in H). A comparison with all participating countries in each survey wave also reveals that the job interestingness score of Japanese workers is relatively low (Fig. B1).====What affects job interestingness? Why are there much fewer interesting jobs in Japan compared to H? Given the scarce literature on how interests are developed and promoted in the workplace, this paper first examines the determinants of job interestingness by performing regression-based inequality decomposition (RBID) proposed by Fields (2003). Second, this paper aims to answer the second question by utilizing the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (BOD) technique. The main results of this study are as follows. First, the RBID results show that both interest match and perceived prosocial meaning of the job are among the three most important factors in both H and Japan. Job autonomy is the second most important factor in H, whereas relatedness (relationship with management and colleagues) is the second or third most important factor in Japan. This implies that the most effective ways to make a job interesting vary across cultures and work organizations. Second, the BOD results show that lower level of job autonomy is the largest factor explaining the lower job interestingness in Japan compared to H. Given the low predictive power of autonomy in Japan, however, promoting autonomy is a less effective way to enhance job interestingness in Japan compared to improving interest matching, perceived prosocial meaning, and relatedness.====This study contributes to the literature in three main ways. First, to my knowledge, this study is the first to empirically examine the determinants of job interestingness. In the field of educational psychology, theoretical and empirical studies on the development and determinants of interests have been developed (Renninger and Hidi, 2011; O'Keefe and Harackiewicz, 2017). In the workplace, similar studies are lacking, although triggering and developing interests are considered crucial for worker performance (Renninger and Hidi 2019a, 2019b; Wille and De Fruyt 2019). This is mainly because in the vocational psychology literature, interests (vocational interests) are considered stable individual traits like personality, which do not generally change in the workplace (Renninger and Hidi 2019a).====In economics, previous studies show that job interestingness is an important determinant of job satisfaction; the most widely examined subjective well-being measure (Sousa-Poza and Souza-Poza, 2000; Benz and Frey 2008; Krekel et al., 2019; Appendix B1 of the current paper). However, job interestingness is rather subjective than other determinants such as work attributes (e.g., autonomy, relations with colleagues, working conditions such as salary). How to make a job interesting to achieve higher job satisfaction remains unknown and needs to be explored. In this sense, job interestingness can be interpreted as an important mediator of various work attributes to indirectly affect job satisfaction.====On the other hand, job interestingness is not just a mediator for job satisfaction but can directly influence various productivity-related outcomes. As Appendix B1 shows, job interestingness is generally the first or second largest predictor for expected worker retention, organizational commitment, actual working efforts, and mental health. Positive effects of job satisfaction on these outcomes are also known (Weiss and Merio, 2015). However, the positive associations between job interestingness and these outcomes generally remain significant even after controlling for job satisfaction and basic worker and job characteristics (Table B6). This implies that job interestingness is likely to have direct influences besides indirect influences through job satisfaction. Interest in a job can also have positive effects on learning in the workplace. Such learning effects are emphasized in the context of education (Krapp et al., 1992; O'Keefe et al., 2017), but not so when discussing the effects of job satisfaction (Weiss and Merio, 2015). Positive learning effects of job interestingness are valuable for both workers and firms, especially now that continuous lifelong learning has become essential due to rapid technological changes, globalization, and rising life expectancy (OECD, 2021). These unique effects of job interestingness justify the study on its determinants.====Second, this study is also the first to focus on the fact that job interestingness in Japan is much lower than in other countries. Since job interestingness enhances worker motivation and task performance, finding the most effective ways to improve job interestingness has a practical implication in the Japanese economy, which has suffered from low labor productivity for several decades.==== Japan is also known for its group- and consensus-based decision-making system and collectivist culture. Consequently, focusing on Japan and comparing it with other countries sheds light on the possibility that effective prescriptions to motivate workers vary across cultures and work organizations.====Third, the empirical approach of this study is closely related to the analysis of meaningful work by Nikolova and Cnossen (2020). They examine the determinants of meaningful work based on the psychology theory (self-determination theory), decompose the variations in meaningful work into key determinants, and analyze the consequences of work meaningfulness. Their analysis, however, relies only on repeated cross-section data. I also mainly examine repeated cross-section data. However, I also utilize panel data to check the robustness of the main results by controlling for unobservable individual characteristics, such as response bias, personality, and innate ability, and by considering possible reverse causality mechanism.

The analysis utilizes a 2005 reform to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) that reduced benefits for ERSRI members who had not vested by 2005, and did not affect high-tenure ERSRI members and municipal government employees. A triple-differences research design yields an elasticity of employer-specific labor supply with respect to deferred benefits of 0.28. Although state employees were more sensitive to benefit cuts than teachers, low elasticities for both groups suggest that the labor market for public employees is not highly competitive.","One-third of state and local defined benefit pensions are so financially troubled that government sponsors may soon need to reduce the benefits promised to current employees (Aubry et al., 2018). Until recently, public pension reforms rarely affected current workers, since state constitutions and statutes traditionally entitle future retirees to the pension formula in place on their date of hire (Monahan 2010; and Munnell and Laura, 2012). Cuts for current workers became more common after the 2008 financial crisis, when courts around the country judged that pensions were crowding out vital government services like K-12 education and police protection (Cloud 2011; and Monahan 2017).==== Since then, 17 states have reduced the post-retirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) earned by current workers, and cuts to promised annuity payments have been successfully legislated in two states and are under discussion in two more (Munnell et al., 2016).==== At the same time, public sector employers are scaling back the generosity of their retiree health insurance (RHI) benefits as they grapple with rising health costs (Lutz and Sheiner 2014; The Pew Charitable Trusts and the McArthur Foundation 2016). Will these cuts to deferred benefits for current state and local government employees encourage workers to leave for the private sector, and what can workers’ response to such cuts teach us about public labor markets generally?====This project takes advantage of a 2005 reform to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) that extended the normal retirement age (NRA), reduced the annual pension benefit, and limited post-retirement COLAs for current public school teachers and state government employees. Most teachers and state employees also lost access to subsidized RHI before age 65.==== Importantly, the cuts applied only to ERSRI members who had not vested by June 30, 2005 (had fewer than 10 years of government service on that date). Vested ERSRI members and municipal government employees (covered by the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System, MERS) in Rhode Island were unaffected. This sharp difference in the level of benefits, based on tenure at a specific date, permits a triple-differences research design in which non-vested members of ERSRI are compared, before and after the reform, to vested members and to all members of MERS.====Rhode Island is an excellent setting for the analysis for both conceptual and pragmatic reasons. Substantively, it was the first state government to enact major pension cuts for current workers. Practically, data for the analysis was readily available as ERSRI provided comprehensive personnel records of state and local government employees (except police officers and firefighters) between 2003 and 2017. Importantly, the data show that Rhode Island's public workforce seems representative of state and local governments across the country, so that lessons learned might translate to future pension reforms in other settings.====To generalize the findings from Rhode Island's specific reform, the analysis scales the effect of the cut by the present value of benefits lost, arriving at an estimate of the separation response to a dollar change in deferred compensation. Specifically, the scaling procedure calculates “peak benefit wealth” for every employee in the data, which represents the maximum present value of benefits that an employee could earn given his current earnings trajectory.==== Although this calculation follows a long literature, the current context requires a methodological innovation: including employer contributions to RHI in the definition of peak wealth.==== For each employee, the magnitude of the cut equals the difference between pre-reform peak wealth and post-reform wealth assuming that the employee separates at pre-reform peak tenure.====The results show that the reform caused an immediate 2.4-percentage-point increase in the rate of separation, corresponding to a 12% increase in the baseline separation rate. For a typical non-vested member of ERSRI, the reform decreased lifetime expected present value of deferred benefits by 43%.==== Hence, the results imply an employer-specific elasticity of labor supply with regard to deferred benefits of 0.28. This elasticity is consistent with a large literature on the wage elasticity of labor supply, but is somewhat higher than the elasticity found by a growing literature on teacher pensions.====Consistent with expectations and past literature, teachers in Rhode Island were less responsive to the benefit cut than other occupations. Whereas general state employees were 4 percentage points more likely to separate due to the pension cut (a 19% increase in the baseline rate), teachers were only 1.7 percentage points more likely to separate (a 9% increase), and the difference between teachers and general state employees is statistically significant. Scaling by dollars of benefits lost permits the analysis to rule out that these differential effects are due to treatment intensity; teachers display an elasticity of separation of 0.22, while other state workers are twice as elastic, at 0.45. This finding implies that teachers’ labor responses to benefit cuts may not generalize to other state and local occupations.====These results have broader implications for the competitiveness of public sector labor markets, and can be applied directly in cost-benefit analyses of public pension and RHI reforms.==== Broadly, the analysis suggests that the labor market for mid-career public employees not perfectly competitive.==== Although state employees were more sensitive to benefit cuts than teachers, the elasticity of separation for all occupations was less than unitary. This result contributes to a growing body of evidence showing that certain labor markets behave as if employers face little competition – such as the markets for minimum-wage workers, nurses, teachers, and software engineers in Silicon Valley – but is also consistent with a monopoly model where unionized public employees earn economic rents.====Because Rhode Island is a small state embedded in a larger regional labor market, it likely provides an upper bound on the employer-specific elasticity of labor with respect to deferred benefits that other public employers might face. Whereas public employees in larger states may only be able to find substitutable employers by moving large distances (often to another state), many Rhode Island residents already commute to neighboring states for work. Therefore, public employees in Rhode Island can more easily respond to benefit cuts by taking comparable jobs elsewhere.====On the policy side, the results of this paper combined with prior literature on turnover costs imply that Rhode Island's benefit cut caused a one-time increase in direct costs of between $1.8 million and $8.1 million – small in magnitude relative to the pension savings. However, since government salaries did not compensate for lost pension benefits, highly skilled employees – such as teachers, nurses, and lawyers – may have selected out of public service. Hiring workers of similar quality in the future might become more difficult.==== How the loss of skilled workers affects government productivity is difficult to quantify, but may prove important.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides an overview of related literature. The third section describes Rhode Island's history of pension reforms and details the natural experiment that occurred in 2005. The fourth section introduces the data and empirical methodology. The fifth section presents empirical results.

Using longitudinal data on the entire Norwegian population, we find that the shock increases male income by around 7%, while reducing female income by up to 14%. Although married women experience the largest income losses, they also have higher household income, revealing the importance of labour supply adjustments within households. While these income shifts persist for two decades, the subsequent generation of female workers are able to close the income gap with their peers in areas less affected by the oil boom.","Over the past few decades, the gender wage gap in industrialized countries has been narrowing and female labour force participation has been steadily increasing. However, this overall trend varies significantly across time and geography (Goldin, 2006, Olivetti, Petrongolo, 2016). Understanding the different labour market outcomes of men and women during economic transformations has important implications for gender equality, yet it is empirically challenging to study this question (Benshaul-Tolonen and Baum, 2019). Ideally, it requires a sizeable and plausibly exogenous change in economic conditions as well as longitudinal data on labour market outcomes over a long time horizon.====This article addresses this challenge by exploiting a substantial and persistent sectoral shock, Norway’s first discovery of oil in 1969, to analyse the effects of an economic boom on individual labour market outcomes for men and women. We leverage the unexpected nature of the shock and the spatial variation in the development of oil-related industries within Norway to identify changes in individual income, household income, and labour supply. We also examine key mechanisms behind these changes, taking advantage of detailed individual- and household-level data that allows us to follow Norwegian residents over their life cycle, before and after the local shock. We hypothesize that the effects of the economic boom on the labour market depend on the substitutability of men and women in the sectors involved and on the reallocation of joint labour supply within households. In addition, the short run impacts may not persist in the long run, for instance, due to the greater flexibility to modify lifetime decisions such as full versus part-time employment, education, fertility, and occupational choices. We test these adjustment channels for different cohorts of the local population.====Following the discovery of oil and the subsequent boom, the income trajectories of men and women are starkly different. Our baseline estimates from an event study show that young working-age men earn significantly higher annual income in booming markets, while young working women, surprisingly, experience a significant fall in annual income. These changes persist for the following 20 years. Importantly, prior to the discovery of oil, differences in income across our treated and control regions are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant, indicating that there were no diverging income trajectories pre-boom. This result is robust to a battery of tests with alternative specifications of the spatial treatment units, to different definitions of the dependent variable, and is not driven by migration across different parts of Norway.====The fact that the income of women declines at times of great economic prosperity is relevant not only for gender equality broadly, but also for intra-household equality and decision-making. Since a large fraction of men and women make labour supply decisions jointly with their partner, we examine our core result not only for individual workers, but also in the context of households. We exploit data on married couples to show that intra-household dynamics are an important factor in explaining the observed decline in income for women. We find that women who are married before the oil shock experience the largest decline in individual income. However, their total household income increases as their husbands earn more. Overall, women’s relative share of household income declines by 6%. It is difficult to evaluate the welfare effects of such a loss because the reallocation of tasks within the household and the higher aggregate income could benefit both spouses. However, women’s lower share of household income is potentially problematic if it reduces their bargaining power (Basu, 2006), if it influences marital satisfaction and stability (Bertrand et al., 2015), and if gender inequality or female unemployment are linked to domestic violence (Aizer, 2010, Anderberg, Rainer, Wadsworth, Wilson, 2016, Cools, Kotsadam, 2017).====We isolate the key mechanisms that drive the reduction in female income in booming regions. In particular, we show that the local economic shock decreases female labour force participation by almost 30%. This decline is driven by a reduction in full-time employment, while for men there is little adjustment at the intensive margin among those who are already attached to the labour force. We further show that men move into high-paying occupations following the boom, while women do not. Thus, the widening gender gap in income is driven mostly by women dropping out of the labour force or not having access to high-paid jobs, either directly in the oil sector or in related industries benefiting from its economic spillovers. Importantly, women’s income losses do not seem to depend on their educational choices nor the decision to have children.====Finally, we extend the analysis to the next generation of workers, who were children at the time of the oil discovery and join the labour force only after the shock. These children are exposed to the economic shock in multiple ways at young ages, for instance through a rise in family income (Løken, 2010, Løken, Mogstad, Wiswall, 2012). We show that the income losses for women progressively disappears for the following cohorts of female workers. The youngest cohort of girls close the pre-existing lifetime income gap with their peers in control regions. In contrast, male lifetime income remains systematically higher for early and later cohorts. These results complement our main findings with an important long-term outlook. Among men and women already in the labour market, the effects of the oil boom are long lasting. Among the following generation of workers, the economic gains persist for men, while the income losses are only present among the first generation of working women.====Our study contributes to a growing literature on the spillovers from localized industrial activities that uses within-country studies (Greenstone et al., 2010). In particular, a number of articles exploit the fact that natural resources offer a source of exogenous variation in economic conditions that are associated with increases in local economic activity and employment during booms.==== Few studies, however, adopt a within-country design to compare local labour outcomes for female and male workers, with evidence on inequalities among workers and within households even scarcer. One exception is Aragón et al. (2018), who find that coal mine closures crowded out female employment in manufacturing and services at the district-level, while male employment rose, with persistent effects over two decades.==== Our paper expands this prior literature by emphasizing the differential effects of a local economic shock on male and female workers at the individual level and even inside households.====Our study also provides new evidence on the long run effects of a resource-driven boom on individual labour market outcomes of men and women. Existing studies, such as the recent literature on fracking in the US, have leveraged an analogous economic boom, but only explore short to medium-run changes in the labour market. These studies find an overall positive impact on wages and other labour market outcomes (Allcott, Keniston, 2018, Bartik, Currie, Greenstone, Knittel, 2019).==== A notable exception is the work by Jacobsen and Parker (2014), which uses US county-level data from the 1970s and 1980s to show that oil booms have long-term negative consequences in terms of joblessness and income depression when a boomtown experiences a bust. For Norway, a small body of work examines the long run consequences of the oil discovery on individuals, but gender and within-household decision making are rarely considered.====Another contribution of our study is the novel finding that women’s annual income declines and remains depressed following the boom while men’s income soars. This finding is especially surprising since Norway is considered to be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world in terms of gender norms (UNDP, 2019, WEF, 2020). One of the largest shocks studied in this literature is World War II: following manpower mobilization towards one of the most gendered industries, the military, regions with higher mobilization rates experience an increase in female labour supply (Acemoglu et al., 2004).==== The effects, however, are long-lasting only for highly educated women who could enter white-collar occupations (Goldin and Olivetti, 2013). The spillovers from these changes in labour demand are relevant also for the following generations of women (Fernández et al., 2004) and are linked to lower educational attainment and more precocious marriage and fertility choices (Jaworski, 2014). Given that the Norwegian oil boom is a substantial and long-lasting sectoral shock with general equilibrium effects on other sectors, our findings highlight the importance of the dynamics of women’s income following a positive shock in a male-dominated industry.====Finally, our study contributes to the diverse literature on the responsiveness of spousal labour supply in compensating for labour market shocks and the importance of the “added worker effect” (Lundberg, 1985). While most papers find evidence of a household labour supply response following spousal earnings shocks (Autor, Kostøl, Mogstad, Setzler, 2019b, Blundell, Pistaferri, Saporta-Eksten, 2016, Goux, Maurin, Petrongolo, 2014, Stephens Jr., 2002), others find a limited role for spousal adjustments to smooth adverse shocks (Halla et al., 2020). In line with the majority of this literature, our findings point to a significant role for within-household labour supply adjustments in response to local economic shocks. While the Norwegian oil boom occurred at a time of increasing female labour force participation, our findings are informative for understanding gender equality in the presence of economic shocks.====The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the analytical framework we use to formulate our testable hypotheses. Section 3 discusses the Norwegian oil discovery. Section 4 presents the data and the estimation sample, and Section 5 outlines the identification and estimation strategy. Section 6 discusses the results and potential mechanisms.

We explore the theoretical wage predictions of the canonical search and matching model of Diamond (1982) in laboratory bargaining experiments. Overall, wages in the experiment are less responsive to changes in the market conditions than theory predicts. Wages respond to changes in unemployment insurance in the correct direction, yet the size of the response is about half of what theory predicts. On the other hand, contrary to theory, wages are unresponsive to changes in the level of unemployment. We also find that wages of new matches are more sensitive than wages of on-going matches, and that the duration of unemployment influences wages in certain settings.","Search and matching models have become the dominant framework for modeling unemployment. The dynamics of labor market variables emitted from these models depends crucially on assumptions/behavior in the wage negotiation process (e.g. Shimer, 2005, Hall and Milgrom, 2008, Gertler and Trigari, 2009). Using field data to understand wage negotiation behavior is a difficult task as one typically does not have data on many of the relevant variables. Our study takes a canonical search and matching model of Diamond (1982) to explore in the laboratory how subjects bargain and how wages respond to changes in the market. The model of Diamond (1982) assumes exogenous matching rate, separation rate, and productivity of a successful match, thus, focusing primarily on wage negotiation in a stochastic matching market. Diamond (1982) on page 218 highlights this fact:====This narrow scope lends itself well to a laboratory test and allows us to better understand wage bargaining behavior in these settings.====In this paper, we design an experiment to replicate the theoretical setting of Diamond (1982) and examine how negotiated wages respond to changes in unemployment insurance and the unemployment rate. Our results suggest that after changes in the unemployment insurance wages move in the predicted direction, but respond by about 40–50% less than predicted. Our results also suggest that wages are unresponsive to changes in unemployment. Further, we find that the rate of failed negotiations is higher in low unemployment settings, suggesting that workers are more willing to walk away from a match when unemployment is low – something that theory says should not occur. In addition to examining the core theoretical predictions of wage formation, we also explore of number of other questions related to the labor literature. In particular, we examine how wages respond to market changes in ongoing vs. new matches (e.g. Bils, 1985, Martins et al., 2012, and Gertler et al., 2016). Our results indicate that wages in new matches are more responsive than those in ongoing matches, even though there are no contracts or concerns about workers effort present in the lab. This suggests that goodwill between match partners generates some degree of wage rigidity in our experiments. We also explore how the duration of being unmatched influences wages (see, e.g., Blanchard and Diamond, 1994, Schmieder et al., 2016, and Nekoei and Weber, 2017, among many others). Our results suggest that the duration of unemployment negatively influences wages even though there is no unemployment stigma or changes in worker productivity in the lab. This indicates that reservation wages of subjects in our experiments decline with unemployment duration.====Our paper also relates to the large experimental literature on bargaining behavior. We will not do justice to this large literature here, but some prominent surveys include Roth (1995) and Camerer (2011). In particular, our paper is closely related to the literature that examines the effect of bargaining positions on surplus division. Some recent experimental work on this includes (Fischer et al., 2007, Anbarci and Feltovich, 2013, and Anbarci and Feltovich, 2018). The literature finds that payoffs are under-responsive to bargaining position. Much of the set-up of our study is inspired by the results in Anbarci and Feltovich (2018). In particular, they find that surplus splits are more responsive to bargaining position (responsiveness of wages to unemployment insurance in our context) in an unstructured bargaining game relative to a Nash demand game.==== In addition, they find that failed negotiations are more common in the Nash demand game. In light of these results, we implement an unstructured bargaining game in our experiments to favor responsiveness in surplus splits. Unstructured bargaining also better represents the informal wage negotiation process common to labor markets. Our experiment differs from Anbarci and Feltovich (2018) in that, while Anbarci and Feltovich (2018) implements a one-period game in which all participants are matched every period (no unemployment), we implement a multi-period game in which a successful negotiation leads to a match continuing into the next period, while an unsuccessful negotiation could result in a number of subsequent unmatched periods (unemployment). This allow us to study the effect of the unemployment rate on negotiated wages. Also, the framing in our experiment differs from Anbarci and Feltovich (2018). Our participants negotiate a wage for the worker while the remainder goes to the firm, a less symmetric framing than in Anbarci and Feltovich, 2018 where participants negotiate over splitting the surplus. Holm and Runnemark (2014) report that less symmetric bargaining reduces the pull toward equal splits.====There are a number of experiments which investigate wage setting behavior in real effort settings (see, e.g., Fehr et al., 1993, Fehr and Falk, 1999, and Buchanan and Houser, 2020). They find that concerns about work effort can cause incomplete wage adjustments. Our experiment differs from these in that productivity is exogenously determined, as is assumed in most labor search models. There also a number of experiments that examine job search models (see, e.g., Cox and Oaxaca, 1989 and Cox and Oaxaca, 1992). They find that experimental results are mostly in line with the theoretical predictions of search termination and reservation wage. Our experiments differs from these in that the wage distribution is not exogenously given to workers, but rather wages are negotiated between a worker and a firm. In addition, there is no search decision in our experiments and matches are formed with some exogenous probability.====Finally, our experiment is complementary to the first chapter of Joslin (2017) that tests predictions of equilibrium unemployment theory using a novel market entry experiment. He reports that, in line with theoretical predictions, increases in productivity lead to more firms entering the market, decreasing unemployment. He also reports that few firms enter when workers have strong bargaining power, increasing unemployment. There are several important differences between Joslin (2017) and our experiment. First, while Joslin (2017) focuses on firms entry, the number of firms in our experiment is fixed. This allow us to introduce exogenous changes in unemployment holding other factors, like productivity, constant. Second, similarly to other bargaining experiments, Joslin (2017) implements a one-period game, while we implement a dynamic multi-period game. This allow us to study how the threat of being unemployed or vacant in subsequent periods affects negotiated wages, how wages respond in ongoing vs. new matches, and how duration of unemployment influences wages.====Our paper follows macroeconomic experimental research literature (see a survey by Duffy (2016)). A typical paper in this literature begins from describing a theoretical micro-founded macroeconomic model and its comparative static predictions (Section 2 in our paper). Next, it introduces modifications necessary for implementation in the laboratory and checks if the comparative static prediction still hold in the modified model (our Section 3). Finally, it conducts the experiment and compares results obtained in the laboratory to the predictions of the model (our Sections 4 and 5).",Wage bargaining in a matching market: Experimental evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001135,14 October 2021,2021,Research Article,161.0

We take advantage of China’s supply and demand’s worldwide shocks to instrument for Chinese import competition and demand for Chilean exports. Our main finding is that increasing manufacturing import competition implied a significant rise in labor informality in more exposed local markets, especially among young and unskilled workers. These groups also suffered significant relative wage losses. Meanwhile, locations that benefited most from the increased demand for primary products experienced a relative increase in employment, particularly among young individuals, and reallocation from self-employment towards salaried jobs in the formal sector, along with relative wage gains among old-age workers. Interestingly, these areas experienced a smaller increase in tertiary education enrollment rates than less exposed areas.","The study of labor market responses to changes in trade flows has long been a subject of study in Economics. The literature has placed particular emphasis on the impact of trade shocks on certain labor market variables, such as employment and wages, stressing the differential impact across sectors, occupations and skill groups (Heckscher–Ohlin, Ricardo–Viner). In this paper, we depart from this approach and join a newer line of research that has focused on the effects of trade on individuals living in geographic areas with different patterns of industrial specialization.==== These papers typically find substantial differences in the spatial distribution of the costs and benefits of trade.====We study the causal effect of trade shocks on Chilean local labor markets, exploiting spatial and time variations in trade exposure arising from initial differences in industry specialization across geographic locations and the evolution of shocks across industries. Besides considering typical outcomes such as employment, unemployment and wages, we focus on labor informality, a distinctive feature of labor markets in developing countries. We build upon recent research that finds that labor informality is a relevant margin of adjustment to trade shocks.==== We also explore the impact of trade shocks on tertiary schooling, in line with the literature that finds that trade liberalization amplifies initial differences in regional factor endowments over the long-run through its effects on human capital formation.====Our main findings suggest that the costs and benefits of trade shocks depend on the local employment structure and vary considerably across sub-population groups. Locations with greater exposure to increasing import competition from China experienced a relative decline in manufacturing employment and wage losses for unskilled and young workers (mainly, in the service sector). Interestingly, labor informality plays a key role in the responses to trade shocks. In particular, we find that rising import competition implied a significant relative rise in labor informality, mainly among male, young and unskilled workers. On the benefits side, we find that locations specialized in the production and processing of primary products experienced a relative increase in employment, driven by the expansion of Chinese demand for Chilean exports. Employment growth mainly benefited young and male individuals. Interestingly, these areas also experienced a slower increase in tertiary education enrollment rates as compared to areas with less exposure.====For identification we exploit two sources of variation: (i) Chinese supply and demand shocks vary over time and across industries; and (ii) Chilean local labor markets (LLMs) exhibit different (pre-shock) patterns of industry specialization. Notably, Chinese demand for Chilean exports was highly skewed towards the mining and manufacturing of basic precious and non-ferrous metals, mainly copper. For its part, Chinese supply shock in Chile was totally focused on manufacturing and, within this sector, was highly heterogeneous across industries.====China’s spectacular growth over the last several decades provides a unique opportunity to measure the causal effect of trade shocks on relevant outcomes. China’s growth was mostly driven by strong investments in infrastructure, increases in total factor productivity, massive migration from rural to urban regions and an export-oriented strategy that placed China as one of the world’s leading manufacturing producers and the main global consumer of primary products.==== The growth in imports and exports driven by China’s economic, political and institutional factors provides a potential exogenous shock to firms and workers from all over the world. The small size, considerable trade openness and flexible labor markets of the Chilean economy increase the suitability of this scenario to study the causal impact of trade-induced shocks on local labor market outcomes.====Our identification strategy is very close to the shift-share approach proposed by Bartik (1991).==== We assume that LLMs are units with different exposures to a common set of industry shocks (driven by China’s trade expansion) with local exposure given by initial industrial composition. In the case under study, we construct the pattern of industry specialization using 1992 census data -a date prior to China’s significant expansion in global trade. This takes into account the fact that the shock may have affected Chilean industrial composition, as our estimates indeed suggest. On the supply side, we exploit the sharp increase in Chinese supply of manufactures as a competitive shock for Chilean locations specialized in manufacturing production. On the demand side, we take advantage of the strong expansion in Chinese demand for commodities as a demand shock for Chilean regions specialized in the production and processing of primary products. In order to consider the possible endogeneity of industry shocks, we use China’s global supply and demand shocks as instruments for Chinese import competition and demand for exports. The exogeneity of local employment industrial composition is ==== more difficult to justify because it assumes that unobserved industry shocks do not affect regional outcomes through the same combination of exposure shares. We conduct several tests to justify this assumption and perform a robustness exercise applying the econometric framework developed by Borusyak et al. (2020). Under this framework, identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. Finally, and importantly, our estimates deliver relative effects across locations but cannot account for the aggregate impact of the shocks, which depend on spillovers across geographic units and other general equilibrium effects (e.g. changes in input and output prices, firms productivity, and aggregate demand multiplier effects).====The main dataset used throughout this paper is the Chilean national household survey (====) conducted by the Chile’s Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) every two or three years.==== We also use information from Chilean demographic censuses (====) sourced from the Chile’s National Institute of Statistics (====). To construct measures of Chinese import competition (CIC) and Chinese demand for exports (CDE) at the industry-level we draw on three additional datasets: ==== (INE), Sectoral GDP from National Accounts elaborated by the Chilean Central Bank (====) and the BACI database (====).====The baseline estimation equation regresses each outcome variable (employment, unemployment and labor informality rates, average wages, hours worked, sectoral employment shares) on the Chinese supply and demand shocks. Since we include LLM and year fixed effects we are exploiting within-LLM variation over time. Our preferred specification also controls for preexisting trends. Since CDE and CIC are endogenous because industry shocks affecting the labor market might be correlated with shocks to import demand and export supply, we instrument these variables with China’s average participation in manufacturing imports and in primary-manufacturing exports across all countries in the world except Chile.==== The former instrument aims to capture China’s supply-driven shocks as measured by its global average market share within specific manufacturing industries over time, and the latter is aimed at capturing China’s demand-driven shocks as measured by its increasing participation in global demand for different products. The results of first-stage regressions show both instruments as having strong predictive power. The identifying assumptions behind this approach are: (i) China’s import and export growth are not driven by Chilean demand and supply industry shocks (which is justified by the fact that Chile is a small economy); (ii) unobserved industry shocks are uncorrelated with LLM outcomes through the same combination of exposure shares than shock measures (which we assess by means of region- and industry-level balance tests); and (iii) trade shocks do not affect labor mobility across LLMs in the short-run. To verify the plausibility of the latter assumption, we study the causal impact of CIC and CDE on migration patterns.====Our main finding is that rising import competition led to a deterioration of labor market conditions in the short-run, which mainly affected young and unskilled individuals. These groups experienced a relative decline in manufacturing employment and wages, and a relative increase in labor informality (unregistered jobs with no access to social security). This is consistent with unskilled (mostly young) workers displaced by import competition relocating to new jobs, often in the service sector and under conditions of labor informality. Meanwhile, unskilled and older workers that remained employed in manufacturing experienced wage losses and rising rates of informality. Informality allows firms to reduce tax and other labor costs at the risk of being caught and forced to pay a fine. Facing stronger competition from imports, some firms may take that risk. Firms may also replace permanent employees with part-time workers and apprentices, and subcontract some production activities with other plants in the informal sector. On the other hand, workers may be more likely to accept an informal labor arrangement in the context of a weaker labor market. Additionally, we find that increasing import competition is associated with a moderate relative increase in the employment rate of young people with some tertiary education which, we argue, might be partially explained by the “added worker effect” hypothesis: as a result of the worsening labor conditions for some members of the household (e.g. old-age workers), secondary workers (e.g. children studying at university or a tertiary institute) may enter the labor market in order to ameliorate negative shocks. In fact, we find that locations facing larger import shocks experienced a relative decline in the fraction of individuals enrolled in tertiary education.====On the other hand, the main benefit from trade was a relative increase in employment in locations specialized in the production and processing of primary products, especially among young workers and males (both skilled and unskilled). Our estimates suggest that job opportunities for young individuals in the primary sector took the form of temporary contracts (presumably short-term or apprentices) instead of permanent wage jobs with social security contributions. In contrast, old-age workers experienced relative wage gains and reallocation from self-employment towards salaried jobs in the formal sector. Finally, locations favored by the demand shock experienced a lower relative rise in tertiary education enrollment, which may hinder local development through its effects on human capital formation. Overall, our findings reveal considerable heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the costs and benefits of trade across sub-population groups.====Our research contributes to a vast literature that examines the impact of Chinese import competition on domestic workers, firms, and markets. Most papers in this field emphasize the negative effects of Chinese imports on employment and wages, which generally focus on the most vulnerable firms, workers, and in particular occupations.==== The deterioration of labor market conditions driven by import competition can lead to worse health outcomes, an increase in crime rates and lower provisions of public goods in affected locations.==== On the benefits side, manufacturing productivity may rise in response to import competition through within-firm innovation and input reallocation towards more efficient plants (Bloom, Draca, Van Reenen, 2015, Utar, Torres Ruiz, 2013). Some workers might attempt to return to their education after losing their job to import competition (Utar, 2018) and young individuals may be more willing to finish secondary education (Greenland and Lopresti, 2016). Generally, consumers gain from trade due to lower prices (Traiberman, 2019; Jaravel and Sager, 2019).====Our paper is most closely related to recent works that study the impact of both supply and demand shocks on local labor markets. Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2014, Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2017 document that regions in Germany specialized in export-oriented industries experienced employment gains that outweighed the employment losses of regions specialized in import-competing industries (but net effects were driven by the rise of Eastern Europe rather than China) and conclude that globalization fostered manufacturing employment in Germany. Egger et al. (2020) document that Turkish regions more exposed to increasing demand for exports from China experienced relative employment gains, while import-competing regions encountered very small effects on the labor market. Costa et al. (2016) suggest that Brazilian regions facing stronger import competition exhibited relative slower growth in manufacturing wages than less exposed areas, while regions specialized in commodities had the benefit of relative wage gains and shifts towards formal employment.====We contribute to this literature by providing causal evidence on the heterogeneous effects of trade shocks across sub-population groups by exploiting spatial and time variations in trade exposure across local labor markets in a small and open developing economy. Our results confirm previous findings in the literature and add some novel contributions regarding the roles played by labor informality and labor supply among secondary household members in response to import competition. In particular, we find that the informal sector acts as a buffer against a negative shock on the local labor market, and that secondary workers may enter the labor market to help ameliorate the shock.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 comments on the recent economic history and reforms of Chile and China and presents a brief theoretical discussion. We discuss the identification problem and the empirical strategy in Section 3, and include a detailed description of the data and summary statistics. All empirical findings are presented and discussed in Section 4. We finish with some concluding remarks in Section 5.

In the flexible US labor market, this has had a limited impact on employment due to the strong employment growth in low-paying manual occupations for workers who are not able to reallocate to high-paying abstract occupations. This may not be the case in some rigid wage European economies, which are capable of creating fewer low-paying manual jobs. We study the effect of a decrease in the proportion of routine jobs on employment and participation rates, conditionally on the level of the minimum wage, in European local labor markets. Our OLS and ==== estimates show that the polarization process has a negative impact on employment and participation rates in high minimum wage countries only.","The polarization of the labor market is now a well-documented phenomenon in the US (Autor et al. (2003) Autor et al. (2006)) and Europe (Goos and Manning (2007), Goos et al. (2014), Dustmann et al. (2009)), beginning in the mid-1980s and accelerating in the 1990s. It corresponds to a strong increase in the share of employment in high-paying abstract occupations and low-paying manual occupations, relative to the share of routine occupations in the middle of the wage distribution. Routine occupations are indeed easier to automate using information technologies, as they contain a large share of repetitive tasks. This has led researchers to reconsider the canonical model of skill-biased technological change toward a more subtle understanding of the labor in terms of tasks. Technology can substitute for workers in a subset of tasks (Acemoglu and Autor (2011)). This process has led to a dramatic deterioration of economic opportunities for low-skilled non-college-educated workers and particularly males (see Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor (2019) or Verdugo and Allègre (2020)). First, workers with low ability who lose their relatively well-paid routine occupations tend to reallocate to manual occupations that pay less on average, as they have no comparative advantage in abstract occupations (Cortes (2016) or Autor (2019)). Second, this creates a “displacement effect”, which lowers the demand for this factor and creates downward pressure on wages for both workers in the occupation that disappeared and occupations to which a share of the workers from the middling occupations reallocate. (Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017)). We argue that, in a context in which labor market institutions do not allow wages to fully adjust, this process could lead to lower employment.====Surprisingly, the impact of this process in terms of aggregate employment has received limited attention (with some notable exceptions, however – see the literature review). The conventional wisdom is that this process has limited implications in terms of aggregate labor market performance. The destruction of routine occupations is accompanied by the massive creation of abstract occupations, mainly for high-skilled workers, and manual jobs for low-skilled workers, especially in the service sectors (Autor and Dorn (2013)). Autor et al. (2015) document an extremely limited impact of technology shocks implying routine job destruction on aggregate employment at the local labor market level in the US. Trade shocks have been argued to be much more costly in terms of aggregate employment (Autor and Dorn (2013)) but seem to be weakly related to polarization (see Goos et al. (2014) and Autor et al. (2015)). In the context of task-biased technological change, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) provide a framework in which wages adjust, allowing the lower occupations to absorb the excess labor supply from the occupations (or tasks) that disappeared at the cost of a downward wage adjustment. We argue that the polarization process could have had a very different impact from that in the US in certain European countries, given the higher minimum wage in place in the latter. In a rigid wage environment, wages do not necessarily adjust to clear the labor market, especially in the left tail of the wage distribution, where the minimum wage plays a crucial role in the wage determination process. This may prevent the creation of a sufficient number of low-paying jobs for low-skilled workers, who cannot reallocate to abstract occupations, to compensate for the destruction of routine jobs, which has been observed in every European country. The United States also has a national minimum wage, but relative to the median wage, it is much lower in many European countries. In France, for instance, in which a significant share of workers (approximately 13% in 2019 according to Garnero (2019)) are paid the minimum wage, Catherine et al. (2015) and Cahuc and Debonneuil (2004) document a strong deficit in manual job creation in the service sector relative to the US economy and relate this difference to the high minimum wage. We argue that, in such an environment, the destruction of routine jobs could have severe consequences in terms of aggregate employment, as routine jobs are often occupied by low-skilled workers, who cannot reallocate to abstract, high-paying jobs.====In this paper, we use the European Union Labor Force Survey (EULFS hereafter), which provides detailed information about the economic situation of a sample of workers from 1983 to 2014 at the subnational level (i.e., on local labor markets). The survey contains comprehensive information on occupations, allowing us to measure the polarization process (i.e., the evolution of the proportion of routine jobs) for each area within a country, which we define as a local labor market (Goos and Manning (2007) and Goos et al. (2014) use the same data). The cross-country dimension of the dataset, with important heterogeneity in minimum wage levels, enables us to measure the heterogeneity in the impact of the decrease in routine jobs on employment and participation rates in a particular local labor market within a country, depending on the level of the minimum wage. Retaining only countries with a national legal minimum wage (8 countries from the 15-country sample of Goos et al. (2014)), we ultimately have a panel of 86 local labor markets within our sample, as defined by the EULFS. There exists considerable heterogeneity in the levels of national minimum wages, ranging from 0.278 to 0.585 as a percentage of the mean wage of full-time workers. This allows us to identify the role of minimum wages in the impact of increasing job market polarization on labor market performance. Our identification relies on two sources of variation. First, we are able to compare the impacts of different degrees of routine job destruction within the same institutional setting. For instance, the local labor markets within a given country have not experienced the same degree of routine job destruction. Second, we are able to compare some local labor markets with roughly similar degrees of routine job destruction located in different countries and subjected to different institutional settings. The EULFS also contains many socioeconomic characteristics that allow us to control for key variables that plausibly affect both the polarization process and the labor market outcome variable that we seek to explain (e.g., age structure, skill supply, industry composition). First, using fixed effects (local labor market and time) regressions in level, i.e. using within local labor markets variations over time, we show that the decrease in the number of routine jobs in a given local labor market has no impact, or a very limited positive one in a local labor market characterized by a low minimum wage, but it is strongly negatively correlated with the employment and participation rates in a local labor market characterized by a strong minimum wage. This outcome is consistent with Autor et al. (2015), who find a very weak effect of polarization on the employment rate for the US economy. This result holds for European countries characterized by a low minimum wage. The very modest increase observed in some specifications is consistent with the results of Verdugo and Allègre (2020), who show an increase in the participation rate of women associated with the polarization process, which they interpret as an intra-household response to the decreasing economic opportunities of men. For flexible wage labor markets, this effect should translate into an increase in the overall participation rate. For rigid wage labor markets, however, it is likely that the overall decrease in employment opportunities for males translates into a decrease in participation for this category of workers, which could more than compensate for the increase in women’s participation.====We then provide more detailed evidence for the mechanisms. Consistent with our narrative, we show that a high minimum wage is associated with less creation of low-paying manual jobs following a decrease in the proportion of routine jobs, which we interpret as evidence of the mechanism that we have in mind to explain the effect of employment polarization in terms of aggregate labor market performance. Some of the workers who have no comparative advantage in abstract occupations and who suffer from the destruction of their routine jobs are unable to reallocate to manual occupations due to the presence of a high minimum wage that prevents the creation of low-paying occupations. We also include alternative labor market institutions, such as employment protection, and their interactions with the proportion of routine to understand whether the impact of minimum wage does not capture the effects of other labor market institutions, which may be correlated with the minimum wage. We show that labor market institutions are only weakly correlated with the level of the minimum wage in our sample. In addition, we find that, even when not controlling for minimum wage level, labor market institutions do not explain much of the dynamics in terms of employment in a context of routine job destruction.====We address the possible endogeneity of the proportion of routine jobs using an instrumental variable (IV) strategy. Despite our inclusion of numerous fixed effects and other controls, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of reverse causality, although the decrease in routine jobs is generally considered a demand shock (related to technology shocks). We follow the logic of the instrumental strategy of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) and use the shocks in ICT investment prices (from the KLEMS dataset) that occurred in the 1990s and that are recognized in the literature as having been among the major factors responsible for the decrease in the proportion of routine jobs (see Autor and Dorn (2013) or Michaels et al. (2014)). The massive adoption of computers and IT technologies substitute for workers (mostly low-skilled) in performing routine taskssuch as bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production and monitoring activitieswhich are readily automatized because they follow precise and well-defined procedures. Specifically, to capture the extent to which a local labor market has been affected by a substantial decline in the price of new technology investments, we rely on a Bartik-type instrument and use the initial sector specialization of the local labor market and the initial ICT capital intensity of sectors, under the assumption that sectors (and local labor markets specialized in these sectors) that use ICT more intensively should be more affected by price shocks in ICT. This assumption allows us to construct the degree of exposure of each local labor market to the (exogenous) technological shocks, explaining the decrease in the proportion of routine jobs. These results are qualitatively similar to those obtained with OLS but are larger in magnitude.====Our results suggest that the impact of the minimum wage may depend on the economic context and, more particularly, the rates at which routine jobs are destroyed and the labor market is experiencing structural transformation. In such a context, more flexible institutional arrangements, such as minimum wages negotiated at the sector or firm level, could be much more efficient (as in countries such as Germany and Sweden). Another possibility that might lead to efficiency gains in such an environment is to fix the minimum wage at a sub-national level because local labor markets have very different exposures to global technology shocks.====We are not the first to question the impact of polarization on aggregate employment and participation rates. Autor et al. (2015) find little evidence that technology shocks that destroy routine jobs have a sizable aggregate impact on employment for the US economy. We show that this conclusion does not necessarily hold in countries with more rigid wages, due to their poor ability to create low-paying jobs. Two papers are very closely related to the mechanisms that we have in mind to explain the potential cost of routine job destruction in term of aggregate employment. First, Bock (2017) uses a calibrated general equilibrium model and find that labor market polarization, by displacing unskilled workers from routine to manual jobs, could explain the strong decline in employment for this category of workers given its substantial labor costs. Using a similar calibration strategy, Albertini et al. (2016) compare the labor market performance of two economies with very different institutional settings (France and the US) in a context in which technology shocks destroy routine jobs. Nellas et al. (2011) also used a theoretical model to compare the employment consequences of the destruction of routine jobs between the US and the UK, which have flexible labor markets, and continental European countries. We directly use data at the local labor market level, which allows us to empirically compare the employment response to polarization across different institutional settings. Jaimovich and Siu (2020) show that the process of polarization may have been responsible for the jobless recovery after the Great Recession of 2008 in the US, given the acceleration of the destruction of routine jobs during this period, which did not recover following the recession. We focus on the long-term impact of labor market polarization on and the role of labor market institutions in this outcome.====Finally, in a very recent paper related to ours, Lordan and Neumark (2018) use the inflows and outflows of employment across the US states and show that workers who have lost their routine jobs are less likely to find a new job in states with a high minimum wage. Our results are in line with their findings, but our paper is distinct from theirs in several respects. First, we focus on aggregate equilibrium labor market performance instead of labor flows. Second, we analyze the effects on both employment and participation rates. Third, using data on European local labor markets allows us to compare very different institutional settings and heterogeneous minimum wage levels and to compare the impacts of very different labor market shocks within the same institutional setting. Finally, we use an IV strategy, which permits a causal interpretation of our results.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first present the data that we employ throughout the paper and some basic stylized facts. Then, we present our empirical strategy. Finally, we present our results and conclude the paper.","Polarization, employment and the minimum wage: Evidence from European local labor markets",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121001111,6 October 2021,2021,Research Article,163.0

Much of the economics literature on peer effects, however, has focused on how the past academic performance of peers impacts an individual’s learning outcomes. The standard peer effects literature has used mostly administrative data sets from the United States and found a range of results from positive, non-linear effects (Vigdor and Nechyba, 2007) to positive effects at the class, but not grade level (Betts, Zau, 2004, Burke, Sass, 2013) to positive effects with heterogeneity (Hoxby, 2000) of past peer academic performance on later individual outcomes.==== The results of non-linearity and heterogeneity in peer effects models indicate that how peers impact each other is a complex process, yet there has been almost no exploration of how peers impact each other in the classroom beyond their past academic performance.====In this paper, I use longitudinal data from Flanders, Belgium to look at the relationship between non-cognitive peer effects and academic performance in mathematics and language.==== This focus on non-cognitive peer effects fits within Sacerdote’s 2011 “broad definition of peer effects to encompass nearly any externality in which peers’ backgrounds, current behavior, or outcomes affect an outcome” and it is the first paper to explicitly look at how non-cognitive traits of peers impact individual learning outcomes in secondary school. This is important since secondary school is a key formative period in a young person’s life and the results produced in this paper can speak to a broad audience of educators. I build on the existing peer effects literature by explicitly using measures of non-cognitive peer and individual level traits in my analysis. I use teacher assessments of personality to construct measures of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extroversion based on the “Big Five taxonomy,” first coined by Goldberg (1981). As noted by Golsteyn et al. (2021), this is the first paper to explicitly consider non-cognitive peer effects.====In this paper, non-cognitive ability is closely related to personality and “soft skills,” which Heckman and Kautz (2012) define as “personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains.” To provide further information on the Big Five, I reproduce Table 1 from Almlund et al. (2011) as Table 1. As Almlund et al. (2011) point out, this is a widely used and accepted taxonomy of personality.====In order to conceptualize how these non-cognitive peer effects might impact learning outcomes, I draw on a range of psychological literature and the standard educational production function. As Almlund et al. (2011) discuss, attainment is a function of IQ, effort, and environment. We can think of non-cognitive peer effects entering the education production function through either effort (e.g. in terms of whether or not peers motivate each other to succeed) or environment (e.g. if peers’ behavior causes disruption to learning or if teachers are particularly motivated by engaged pupils). Golsteyn et al. (2017) helpfully note that when the environment is affected, the efficiency of learning is affected. In this context, peers’ Big Five personality traits may impact the environment (learning efficiency) and individual effort, which I discuss further in the Empirical Strategy section.====I use these non-cognitive measures to estimate three sets of models, beginning with the linear-in-means model (LIM), as well as several robustness checks. The assumption underlying the LIM is that having higher ability peers on average impacts individual level outcomes. Second, I estimate models that include a mean peer effect term and variance peer effect term in order to disentangle the effect of the tightness of the ability distribution from the mean on outcomes. There are differing schools of thought on how variance in ability can impact individual outcomes. Sacerdote (2011) highlights the “rainbow” and the “boutique” models. The rainbow model posits that high levels of variance, i.e. diversity, is beneficial, while the boutique model posits that a similar level of ability is beneficial because it allows teachers to teach at one level. Policies of tracking or streaming pupils based on ability are common in secondary school (Slavin, 1990) and reflect the boutique model. They work on the assumption that a class with a lower variance, i.e. more similar pupils, positively affects a pupil’s outcome. Including the variance terms allows me to test this.====Third I estimate models of peer effects that focus on the impact of having pupils with very high or very low non-cognitive skills in a classroom. The “shining light” model hypothesizes that having very good pupils in the classroom serves as an example for the others and thereby pulls them all up (as they increase effort), while the “bad apple” model hypothesizes that having very poor performing or ill-behaved pupils disturbs learning in such a way to drag her peers down (decreasing efficiency) (Sacerdote, 2011). The bad apple model of peer effects has received considerable attention in the literature (e.g. Lazear, 2001). In order to test the validity of these two hypotheses, I estimate a model that includes the percent of pupils in each class in the bottom and top quintiles of the entire cohort’s ability distribution. This is important since there may be differential returns to very high or very low values of these traits.====Golsteyn et al. (2021) is the only other paper to examine the importance of peer personality on individual learning outcomes. They exploit random allocation to university seminar groups at Maastricht University to examine how peers’ persistence, self-confidence, anxiety, and risk attitude impact test outcomes. Their findings show that being exposed to more persistent peers positively affects performance while being exposed to more risk taking peers negatively affects performance. My paper is different from Golsteyn et al. in several key ways. First, I use data from compulsory schooling, which is arguably more representative of how peer effects might work for a broad swath of the population. Secondary school is a key point in a young person’s life before transitioning into further education or the labor market, so understanding peer effects in this context is important. Second, I use school fixed effects as the identification strategy. Most secondary schools do not use random allocation to classrooms. The evidence generated by this paper is therefore useful to a broad range of policymakers and educators who do not plan on randomly allocating students to classes. Third, I use Big Five personality traits. These measures have been used in range of papers across disciplines, which allows for comparability of results. They are also easy to collect given recent advancements in 10 question versions, which only take one minute to administer (Rammstedt and John, 2007 and Hahn et al., 2012).====Neidell and Waldfogel (2010) also look at non-cognitive peer effects in their paper examining the impact of peer group kindergarten attendance on first grade learning outcomes. Unlike this paper, they use measures of peer behavior as predictors of individual learning outcomes. Their findings show that high peer externalizing problems, behaviors associated with “defiance, impulsivity, disruptiveness, aggression, antisocial features, and overactivity” (Hinshaw, 1992), negatively affect learning outcomes. Apart from their paper, most other peer effects studies looking beyond the traditional channel of past academic performance have focused on gender (e.g. Hoxby, 2000 and Lavy and Schlosser, 2011). Hoxby (2000) shows that having a higher proportion of girls in a classroom positively impacts learning outcomes. The mechanism through which this works, however, has yet to be fully explained. One potential explanation is that girls and boys have on average different strengths and weaknesses in terms of non-cognitive skills. Bertrand and Pan (2013) review the medical and psychological evidence that points to this, e.g. the fact that boys are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Aizer (2008) explicitly looks at ADHD and exploits exogeneity in access to treatment as a way to change peer behavior. She finds that improvements in peer behavior improve academic outcomes, which indicates that peer behavior is perhaps just as important as peer cognitive ability in determining outcomes, supporting the mechanism of environment affecting learning efficiency. This paper contributes to the peer effects literature by being the first to explicitly model how personality traits affect learning outcomes in secondary school over and above traditional academic peer effects in a context relevant to most young people.====There is a related literature on the linkage between non-cognitive traits and learning and labor market outcomes. The growing evidence out of this literature shows that non-cognitive ability may matter just as much or even more than cognitive ability for labor market outcomes. Borghans et al. (2008) and Almlund et al. (2011) provide extensive overviews of this literature.==== Heckman and Rubinstein (2001) provide evidence on the importance of non-cognitive skills on “General Educational Development” (GED) test outcomes, a high school diploma equivalency exam, in the United States. They do not identify any one non-cognitive skill in their analysis, but find that GED recipients earn less, have lower hourly wages, and obtain a lower level of schooling than high school dropouts, which they attribute to lower non-cognitive skills. Not only are non-cognitive traits important for future outcomes, but they can be developed, which makes them of interest to policy makers. Heckman et al. (2013) show that non-cognitive traits are malleable in a long-term way using data from the Perry Preschool Project.====The data used in this paper allows me to account for many of the pitfalls commonly associated with the peer effects literature. I account for the endogeneity of peers in part through a school fixed effects approach and in part through the construction of the data set. All of the pupils in this data set are starting secondary school at a new school with mostly new peers, which enables me to avoid many of the problems that arise from administrative data including the “reflection problem” (Manski, 1993). The reflection problem arises because peers influence each other over time, which means that in most cases, an individual will have helped to shape the peer effect term used in analysis. Because my peer effects are calculated using individual level measures collected from the end of primary school, most of the new peers in their secondary school will not have influenced each other over time. I show that most peers in math and language classes did not attend primary school together and that my results are robust to excluding those who did know many of the peers from primary school.====The data set also includes a rich array of socio-economic status (SES) measures, personality measures, and an intelligent quotient (IQ) test, allowing me to control for much of the unobserved heterogeneity between pupils and account for most, if not all, of the selection into classrooms. I run a series of robustness checks around the issue of selection into classrooms. They show that individuals are not selected into classes on the basis of their non-cognitive traits. Importantly, while peer non-cognitive traits impact learning outcomes at the end of the school year, they do not impact tests taken at the very beginning of the school year.====I find that having more conscientious peers in a classroom is positively related to individual math and language performance. I also find that having more extraverted peers in a classroom is negatively associated with individual math performance. I find no support for peer IQ or past subject performance positively impacting results in the standard linear-in-means framework. I also find limited support for alternative models of non-cognitive peer effects. These peer effects seem to work primarily through the class average.

This finding has important implications for the evolution of worker disparities during future downturns.,"Against a backdrop of rising inequality, the existence of racial labor market disparities is a key public concern. Economists have studied labor market disparities along several dimensions, focusing on trends in factors including differential worker productivity, the relative supply of workers, unionization, and skill-biased technical change.==== Considerable attention has also been devoted to understanding the labor market effects of economic shocks, with a view toward worker inequality in several instances.==== However, existing research has yet to determine whether and how any given shock-inequality connection is mediated by preexisting worker-firm matching, which in particular may vary across racial groups (e.g., white, Hispanic, and Black workers).====The closest that researchers have come to doing so has been through the use of information about displaced workers from survey data. Fairlie and Kletzer (1998) and Wrigley-Field and Seltzer (2020) use the Displaced Worker Survey – a supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) – to document how Black and white workers were differentially affected by job displacements during the 1980s and from 1981 to 2017, respectively. However, displacement in these articles includes losses not only from establishment closures, as in our study, but also losses from the elimination of positions/shifts and losses from insufficient demand. These additional sources of displacement potentially conflate pre-downturn matching with post-downturn employer discretion over who to let go during periods of downsizing. Similarly, Davis and von Wachter (2011), which combines CPS data with information from the Business Employment Dynamics database and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey to analyze the effect of job destruction on employment by gender and age from 1974 to 2008, defines destruction to include employment losses stemming from both closing and shrinking establishments. Other notable articles that estimate the effects of recessions and rising unemployment rates on employment by worker race include Badgett (1994), Couch et al. (2018), and Schwandt and Von Wachter (2019), but none of these consider displacement arising from establishment or firm closures.====In this article, we explore how the pre-recession matching between workers and establishments affects inequality across workers by race, in terms of employment losses related to establishment deaths during the Great Recession.==== If workers are matched to establishments non-randomly by race, then the racial groups concentrated within establishments least able to survive the downturn will experience a disproportionate share of the employment decline.==== Focusing exclusively on employment changes from establishment deaths (as opposed to changes from non-closing establishments) is key for understanding the connection between worker inequality and pre-downturn matching, given that, by definition, death-based changes cannot be affected by post-downturn employer favoritism toward one racial group over another. We use the Great Recession, a downturn that was abrupt, deep, and widespread, to uncover evidence of such sorting across establishments by race. Under our approach, the degree to which workers of different races are differentially distributed according to unobservable establishment resilience is revealed by the change in racial employment inequality explained by establishment deaths.====This concept of resilience is related to but distinct from establishment productivity. In the sizable literature on the “cleansing” of lower-productivity establishments during economic downturns, Foster et al. (2016) note that the cleansing (productivity reallocating) effect appears to have been weaker during the Great Recession relative to prior downturns.==== To the extent that firm resilience is related to productivity, this result suggests that our estimates might understate the relative employment effects to be found in a more “typical” recession. However, it is worth noting that Lee and Mukoyama (2015) does not find large productivity differences between manufacturing plants exiting during downturns versus those exiting during normal times.====In addition to establishment productivity, resilience during downturns might also be related to a number of other factors identified in the prior literature. One prominent such factor could be financial constraints, as high-productivity but financially vulnerable firms are forced to exit the market during economic recessions (see Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, Rosen, 1994, Musso, Schiavo, 2008, Osotimehin, Pappadá, 2016). Similarly, research has generally found greater cyclical employment sensitivity for smaller and younger firms (e.g., Crouzet, Mehrotra, 2020, Fort, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, Miranda, 2013), although these analyses tend not to focus on employment losses stemming specifically from establishment deaths. One exception is Lee and Mukoyama (2015), which finds little difference in the size of manufacturing plants (in terms of employment) exiting at different points in the business cycle.====Another potential correlate of resilience is the race of the business owner, as the Great Recession appears to have impacted Black-owned businesses more severely than white-owned businesses in terms of both employment and survival (Jarmin et al., 2014). To the extent that Black-led businesses have a higher share of Black employment, this channel could account for some of our aggregate findings. The subprime crisis hit Black households particularly hard (Gerardi, Willen, 2009, Rugh, Massey, 2010), suggesting highly local credit channels as a possible mechanism. Determining how much, if at all, these various factors contributed to resilience during the Great Recession is beyond the scope of our analysis.====The key methodological contribution of this article is to recover the component of the change in employment inequality that is explained by establishment deaths. In our context, this change is defined as the difference across worker race (e.g., white vs. Black) in the aggregate percent change in employment over the Great Recession.==== As direct and nationally comprehensive measures of worker-specific employment changes arising from establishment deaths are unavailable, we propose a method for statistically decomposing employment changes by worker race into four mutually exclusive and exhaustive components: those due to establishment deaths, births, contractions, and expansions. The approach exploits variation in each of these establishment-level causes while imposing restrictions so that the overall predicted employment changes by race and by cause match those observed in the data.====With the decomposition in hand, we adapt the well-established procedure from the literature for isolating across- and within-industry variation,==== separating the overall employment change attributed to establishment deaths into across and within components. These terms intuitively depend on the race-specific employment changes and employment shares at the industry level; the across component is a function of the average employment changes across race groups and the differences in shares by race, while the within component is a function of the differences in employment changes by race and the average employment shares across race groups. While the extent to which establishment deaths can explain across-industry patterns is interesting, focusing on the within-industry changes is particularly informative. Doing so rules out the deaths effects from being driven by a correlation between industry-specific preferences and industry vulnerability to demand shocks.====We apply our empirical framework to employment data from the Census Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), broken down by worker race, geography (county), and industry (at the NAICS four-digit level). These publicly available data cover the vast majority of private sector employment for virtually all counties in the United States for the years surrounding the Great Recession. Our near-universal coverage is important – in order to identify the aggregate effect on worker inequality, it is necessary to trace out how ==== industry and ==== county is impacted by the Great Recession, rather than a subset. Our administrative data is in contrast to individual survey data (e.g., CPS), which does not contain a sufficient number of observations to conduct analyses at the four-digit industry by county level, and which may suffer from recall bias. We supplement the QWI with Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) data from the Census on the number of establishment deaths, births, contractions, and expansions by county and four-digit NAICS. We then link this establishment information to employment shifts by industry, county, and worker race.====Applying our decomposition method reveals substantial changes in employment inequality by race over the Great Recession. In keeping with prior analyses, while all racial groups lost employment, Black workers were disproportionately affected by the downturn, with a decline that was about 25% larger than the loss for white workers and approximately five-sixths larger than Hispanic workers. Black workers fared even worse with respect to employment losses stemming from establishment deaths, losing at twice the rate of white and Hispanic workers.====The decomposition into across- and within-industry components reveals that the more pronounced employment losses for Black workers were driven entirely by within-industry declines, with white and Hispanic workers incurring greater losses as a result of their unfavorable preexisting distribution across industries. More importantly, the within-deaths estimates indicate that Black workers were disadvantaged within industry precisely because they were concentrated in less resilient establishments prior to the recession.====Our work relates to a prior literature that examines the effects of individual establishment closures, arguing that these can be seen as natural experiments that allow researchers to evaluate the wage losses that result from job separations.==== Our approach offers a complementary view, focusing on aggregate employment losses across all establishment deaths, rather than the subsequent effects of a single establishment death on its former workers. Our finding that minority workers are more likely to be employed at firms that are less resilient to negative shocks and more likely to close is not something one could discern using data from a single establishment.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the data used in our analysis. Section 3 sets out our framework for exploring changes in inequality, detailing the procedure for determining the extent to which the gap in the employment growth rates by race can be attributed to each establishment-level cause (deaths, births, contractions, and expansions), as well as decomposing each gap into across- and within-industry components. Section 4 provides several stylized facts about the Great Recession, lending context to our main empirical results, which we present in Section 5. Section 6 then justifies our approach by formalizing the sources and direction of potential bias, undertaking a sensitivity analysis, assessing goodness-of-fit using an out-of-sample exercise, and showing that our results are robust to the use of alternative geographical and industry definitions.

In many states transgender people are forced to undergo surgical procedures if they wish to change their gender on ID documents, which can be invasive, expensive, and is not always desired. In the present work state variation in the timing of the removal of surgical requirements is exploited within a triple difference framework to analyse the causal impact of these removals on the employment of transgender people, for the first time. The findings highlight that removing surgical requirements for transgender people to be able to reassign gender on birth certificates increases the employment of female to male transgender people, but has no effect on male to female or gender non-conforming transgender people.","Around 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender==== (Flores et al., 2016), and it is well documented that these individuals face prolific transphobia and bias in the labour market, resulting in harassment, exclusion, and poverty (Kollen, 2016; Leppel, 2016, 2019; Carpenter, 2020). However, economic research relating to trans-experience is limited, mainly due to a dearth of data on trans identities. Of the limited research that has been completed, economists have generally documented that trans people are less likely to be employed than cisgender people (Leppel, 2016, 2019; Carpenter et al., 2020) and face discrimination in the labour market (Van Borm and Baert, 2018; Van Borm et al., 2020; Granberg et al., 2020).====Trans people face serious exclusions when their identification documents do not reflect their gender identity (Drydakis, 2017a; Centre for American Progress, 2015). The process of obtaining identification documents that reflect gender identity differs significantly across US states (Centre for American Progress, 2015). In many states trans people are only allowed to amend their identification if they have undergone surgical treatment, which involves changing the genitalia of an individual to reflect their gender identity. But, for many trans people sex reassignment surgery may not be affordable, or even desired (Drydakis, 2017a). Not only has descriptive evidence highlighted the impact of incongruent documents on the discrimination faced by transgender people in the workplace (James et al., 2016), but the labour market consequences of incongruent documents have a theoretical underpinning.====Incongruent documents signal to potential employers that an individual is transgender, and as such, this increases the possibility of discriminatory employers discriminating against individuals with incongruent documents. In addition, gender markers on identification documents offer a signal of gender to employers and these may impact the likelihood of discrimination along the lines of binary gender, where previous research has documented a preference for men in the labour market (Guryan and Charles, 2013; Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014). Obtaining congruent documentation is also positively associated with health and wellbeing (Meyer, 2003; Sheim et al., 2020), which is positively associated with labour force outcomes (see inter alia; Ettner et al., 1997; Ojeda et al., 2010; Banerjee et al., 2017; Gondek, 2018; Isham et al., 2020).====The effect of surgical restrictions to change the gender marker on identification documents on the labour market outcomes of trans people are yet to be explored. These may have serious implications considering that the removal of these restrictions increases access to congruent documentation, especially for those transgender individuals that may choose to not undergo surgical treatment or cannot afford to do so. Indeed, recent descriptive work by the Williams Institute demonstrates that fewer barriers to changing identity documents are associated with increased likelihood of having congruent documents amongst transgender people (Herman and O'Niell, 2021).====Studying the labour market outcomes of trans people is important for several reasons. Firstly, studying the labour market outcomes of trans populations is important considering its policy relevance. In the US, trans legislation varies across states, and as such empirical analysis can evaluate what policies have the best traction in improving the labour market outcomes of trans people, as well as informing economists and policy makers of what works for LGBT+ workers. More broadly, empirical analysis of trans populations offers new insights into the broader effects of gender in the labour market, enabling an analysis of the differential effects of presentation, identity, and sex.====In the current work variation in the timing of the removal of surgical restrictions to change legal gender on identification documents is exploited in a triple difference framework to explore the effect of the removal of these restrictions on the employment of transgender people, for the first time. This is the first paper to consider the implications of requiring people to undergo surgical procedures (by law) to be able to change their documentation to reflect their identity. The analysis presented in the current work is important for policy makers as it highlights the negative impact that surgical restrictions to change legal gender have on the labour market outcomes of trans people. More broadly, results presented in this study are one of the first to document the economic effects of the expansion of transgender rights which is particularly important given the rise in transgender restrictive policies (such as transgender exclusions in sport and bathroom bills) in recent years.====The remainder of this article is structured as follows.

Like many other countries, during this period, the Netherlands experienced a quick spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, adopted a set of fairly strict social distancing measures, gradually reopened, and imposed another lockdown to contain the second wave. We show that socioeconomic status is strongly related to changes in working hours, especially when strict economic restrictions are in place. In contrast, household income is equally unaffected for all socioeconomic groups. Examining the drivers of these observations, we find that pandemic-specific ==== (the ability to work from home and essential worker status) help explain the socioeconomic gradient in total working hours. Household income is largely decoupled from shocks to working hours for employees. We provide suggestive evidence that large-scale labor hoarding schemes have helped insure employees against shocks to their employers.","Beginning in early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemiccc has strongly affected working lives around the world. A large number of studies have tracked the crisis’ initial impact in the US and European countries on employment, hours worked, and income.====). Neither is it well understood how employment, hours, and income developed throughout the first year of the pandemic; nor why variations across countries are so large.====We add to this understanding by providing an in-depth analysis of individual labor market trajectories throughout 2020 in the Netherlands, a stereotypical Northwestern European country along many core dimensions.==== The Dutch government imposed a lockdown from March to May 2020, which was followed by re-opening most parts of the social and economic life over the summer. A second wave of the pandemic led to another lockdown in autumn and winter. Business closures were accompanied by labor hoarding schemes for the employed and various subsidies for the self-employed. Government restrictions and changes in consumer behavior directly affected firm demand; labor supply may be affected by fear of infection or childcare needs.====We make use of customized panel data collected for seven periods during the year 2020 in the LISS panel, a high-quality online survey based on a probability sample of the Dutch population. Doing so allows us to access a ==== of background characteristics from prior years in addition to contemporaneous measures of labor market outcomes and potential drivers thereof.====) and in Canada employment fell by about 15 percentage points (====).====Second, working hours declined strongly among those who were working just before the pandemic started to affect labor markets. Considering the extensive and intensive margin jointly, hours had dropped by 15 percent on average by April. They stayed roughly at this level for the rest of 2020—aggregate changes were within the realm of seasonal fluctuations. This pattern is very different when breaking down the evolution of working hours by socioeconomic group, measured by education and personal income. Less educated or low-income individuals reduced working hours roughly twice as much as others. This socioeconomic gradient becomes smaller during the summer when infection rates were low and social-distancing restrictions were more relaxed. Again, these facts are consistent with administrative microdata covering the first half of 2020 (====). The initial impact on aggregate working hours is only about half of what ==== find for Canada, but the heterogeneity in the effect is comparable to their findings. During the second lockdown in December, the gradient becomes steeper again but stays below its spring levels. Throughout the year, the evolution of hours worked from home by socioeconomic group tracks the differential evolution of total hours worked.====The third stylized fact is that the distribution of household income hardly changed throughout 2020. Relative to household income in the pre-pandemic months, the median of subsequent changes is zero. This is true across different socioeconomic groups, whether these are measured by education, personal income, or long-run household income. Across these groups, the first and third quartiles of changes in household income are very similar and of limited magnitude. These patterns stand in contrast to the experiences of countries like the UK, where household earnings around the median decreased by 15 percentage points between February and May and poorer households were affected much stronger (====). Their earnings measure includes transfers made through the furloughing scheme; its dynamics should be similar for most parts of the income distribution to our comprehensive measure of income. Similarly, earnings decreased for almost 40 percent of the US population until April (====). Losses were, however, more than compensated by direct transfers from the unemployment insurance system which had a (temporary) replacement rate above pre-pandemic earnings for the lowest income groups (====, ====, ====). Unlike our results, most countries surveyed in this literature experienced some form of heterogeneity in the income response, either by age or education (see, e.g., ==== for China, Japan, Korea, Italy, UK, US; ==== for Thailand, Malaysia, UK, Italy, Slovenia), but only some countries had regressive effects on the lowest income groups, such as France (====) and Italy (====).====We then leverage our panel data and the tailor-made questionnaires to examine the drivers of these observed trends. During the initial lockdown, essential worker status and the fraction of work that can be done from home explain most of the socioeconomic gradient in total hours worked.==== The two characteristics interact strongly: telecommutability only plays a role for non-essential workers. In September—when infection rates were low and restrictions on social and economic life were few—these pandemic-specific mechanisms do not play a role and there hardly is a socioeconomic gradient in hours worked. Their importance is large again in December, but weaker than in early spring. These patterns suggest that the best way to ameliorate the socioeconomic gradient inherent in the pandemic’s impact on labor markets is to keep infection rates low.====7 and ====13 percent, whereas the third quartile is between 13 and 17 percent. There is no relation with hours worked. By contrast, the first quartile of the distribution of household income innovations is a loss of about one quarter for the self-employed, for those who become unemployed, and for those who drop out of the labor force. The median is clearly negative for the three groups as well. For those who become unemployed, losses at the third quartile are still 14 percent.====Compared to other countries, separations to non-employment are very low in the Netherlands. The perfect insurance against changes in hours worked for employees that we just described is very rare. We thus run another set of quantile regressions of household income on employment transitions and whether employers’ took up the wage subsidy scheme (NOW), which required to continue paying the full wage. Across quartiles, employer take-up of policies is unrelated to household income, suggesting that the combination of firing restrictions and large-scale support policies helped insure employees very well against the fallout of the crisis. The self-employed were hit much harder; the first quartile of those who benefited from any program targeting the self-employed saw their households’ income drop by around 70%.====The next section describes the setting for our analysis and the data we collected.

In an environment where both the skill premium and the share of skilled workers are changing, however, the between-skill-group component of inequality may fall even as the skill premium rises – a pattern that is indeed observed in the U.S. and in many local labor markets during the 2010s. Understanding the evolution of the skill premium is therefore not always useful in terms of understanding why broad inequality measures are changing.","Models of Skill-Biased Technical Change (SBTC) have been very influential in the analysis of wage inequality. These models posit that a key driver of inequality is the increasing demand for skilled workers due to the development of new technologies (Autor, Katz, Krueger, 1998, Juhn, Murphy, Pierce, 1993, Katz, Murphy, 1992, Tinbergen, 1974, Tinbergen, 1975). If the growth in the demand for skilled workers outstrips the growth in the supply of these workers induced by rising educational attainment, then the skill premium (i.e. the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers) will grow. Understanding the drivers of the skill premium is viewed, through the lens of these models, as being critical to our understanding of broader wage inequality patterns. A wide range of empirical work has been inspired by these models and has focused on the skill premium as a key outcome of interest.====The skill premium is, however, not a comprehensive measure of wage inequality. In this paper we highlight the fact that wage inequality – and in particular the “between-skill-group” component of wage inequality – may fall even as the skill premium is rising. This is due to the fact that overall between-group inequality depends not only on the wage gap between the two skill groups, but also on the size of each group. All else equal, a rise in the skill premium increases between-group inequality. However, a rise in the skill share, all else equal, will decrease between-group inequality if the share of skilled workers is high enough. Hence, in an environment where both the skill premium and the share of skilled workers are growing (as is the case in practice), a rising skill premium may be observed alongside a decline in between-group inequality. We show that over recent years in the U.S. the between-group component of inequality has indeed declined in absolute terms, even as the skill premium has continued to rise. The same pattern is observed in many local labor markets. Increases in the skill premium therefore do not provide clear insights for understanding the rise in overall wage inequality in the U.S. economy over recent years.====Our analysis uses data for the period 1980–2019 from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey. We begin by verifying the well-documented rise in the skill premium and in overall wage inequality in the U.S. economy over this time period. We then perform a decomposition of the variance of log wages into a component related to differences between skill groups (i.e. those with at least some college education and those with at most a high school degree), and a component related to wage differences within skill groups. Naturally, the skill premium is unrelated to the within-group component, but one may expect that it would provide useful guidance on the evolution of the between-group component. This is not however the case. Over the most recent decade (2010–2019), in spite of the continued increase in the skill premium, between-group inequality actually fell.====In order to clarify why between-group inequality can fall even as the skill premium is rising, we analyze the statistical link between these two measures. Between-group inequality depends not only on the skill premium, but also on the relative size of the two skill groups.==== Holding the skill composition constant, a rise in the skill premium indeed leads to more between-group inequality. On the other hand, changes in the share of skilled workers (holding the skill premium constant) have an ambiguous effect on between-group inequality. A rise in the share of skilled workers will lead to a rise in between-group inequality if the share of skilled workers is below 50%, and will lead to a decline in between-group inequality if the share is above this threshold. This threshold is empirically relevant, given that it was crossed in the U.S. economy during the 1980s. Indeed, between 2010 and 2019, the downward pressure on between-group inequality exerted by the rising share of skilled workers empirically dominated the upward pressure on between-group inequality exerted by the rising skill premium.====Our conclusions about the lack of a direct empirical link between the skill premium and overall between-group inequality (in an environment where skill shares are changing) are valid beyond a measure based on the variance of log wages, and are also observed when using other standard measures of inequality such as the Gini or the Theil indices. We also illustrate the potentially diverging signs of the change in between-group inequality and the change in the skill premium using data at the local labor market level. We find that locations where the skill premium went up but between-group inequality fell between 2010 and 2019 account for around one-fifth of the total workforce in 2019.====The SBTC framework is considered to be the “canonical model” for understanding changes in wage inequality (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). The model is conceptually attractive and has proven to be empirically successful, at least over certain time periods and subject to some caveats (see for example Acemoglu, 2002, Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008, Card, Lemieux, 2001, Carneiro, Lee, 2011, Goldin, Katz, 2008, Johnson, 1997). Even though the predictions of the SBTC model relate solely to the skill premium, it is generally perceived to be a useful model in terms of understanding (at least some of) the reasons behind the rise in overall wage inequality. For example, as summarized by Acemoglu (2002), “the recent consensus is that technical change favors more skilled workers, replaces tasks previously performed by the unskilled, and exacerbates inequality”. In a more policy-oriented setting, Mishel et al. (2013) state that “the influential “skill-biased technological change” (SBTC) explanation claims that technology raises demand for educated workers, thus allowing them to command higher wages – which in turn increases wage inequality”, while Steelman and Weinberg (2005) argue that “overall, the best explanation for the increase in wage inequality appears to be skill-biased technical change”. While many of the papers that study wage inequality provide more comprehensive analyses that go beyond the skill premium, the usefulness of the SBTC model as a framework to understand overall wage inequality relies on the premise that the skill premium is informative about broader inequality patterns.====Our paper makes two key contributions to the literature. The first is to show that, in an environment where both the skill premium and the share of skilled workers are changing, there is no direct empirical link between changes in the skill premium and changes in overall inequality patterns. As we indeed observe for the U.S. and for many local labor markets in the 2010s, between-group wage inequality may decline even as the skill premium is rising. In such cases, between-group differences are not contributing to the rise in overall inequality in spite of the increase in the skill premium. Understanding the evolution of the skill premium is therefore not necessarily in and of itself useful in order to understand why inequality is changing. Researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding why aggregate measures of inequality are rising should be cautious about drawing inferences based on the rise in the skill premium alone.====The second key contribution of the paper is to show that educational expansions will lead to changes in wage inequality that go beyond the channel that has been highlighted in SBTC models, i.e. the idea that an increase in the supply of skills decreases inequality because it puts downward pressure on the skill premium. As we show, in addition to this indirect effect through the skill premium, a change in the supply of skills has a direct effect on inequality due to the statistical properties of standard inequality measures. This direct effect may amplify or offset the indirect effect operating through the change in the skill premium. It is important for researchers and policymakers to take this additional channel into account when considering the inequality-related implications of an educational expansion policy.====The key messages of this paper also apply to the more recent literature which presents a more nuanced view of the impacts of technological change by distinguishing between the skills that workers possess and the tasks that they perform (Acemoglu, Autor, 2011, Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003, Goos, Manning, 2007). Recent work in this area, such as Acemoglu and Restrepo (2021), focuses on how the automation of certain tasks has led to changes in the wage structure across different demographic groups. Similarly to the SBTC literature, their framework assumes that the size of each demographic group is fixed. Hence, while the results in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2021) provide key new insights about how the wages of different groups have evolved, if we want to understand aggregate changes in between-group wage inequality (and hence the contribution of between-group differences to overall inequality), it is crucial to also take into account how the relative size of the different groups has changed. Our results show that overall between-group inequality may fall even if the relative wage gaps across demographic groups are rising. Moreover, educational expansions and other changes in the demographic composition of the economy may have first-order effects on aggregate measures of inequality that go beyond what is captured by the relative wage structure.",Between-group inequality may decline despite a rising skill premium,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000981,14 September 2021,2021,Research Article,168.0

We exploit a representative survey of establishments covering all European Union countries to measure employers’ search for internal candidates. Internal search is a widespread practice: 66% of establishments typically search internally. The accumulation of specific skills and the provision of incentives for employees are the main advantages of hiring internally in the theoretical literature. Ordered probit estimates show that on-the-job training and internal search are positively associated. On the contrary, incentive schemes such as variable pay are not associated with employer search. These results help to assess competing theories, and in particular, suggest that specific human capital is an important driver of internal hiring. Finally, we uncover two interesting facts that need further research: internal hiring is less likely in service firms and in non-competitive product markets.","Employers fill a vacancy by hiring from outside the firm or by promoting or re-assigning their own workers. A longstanding and still debated question in personnel economics concerns the reasons for the high share of job vacancies (hovering around 60%) that are filled internally (DeVaro, 2020). Why should a firm favor inside candidates over outside ones? A well developed theoretical literature has explored different motives (Waldman, 2013). Employers are expected to select internal candidates to increase work incentives or save on training costs as incumbent employees have accumulated firm-specific skills. However, empirical evidence on this question is scarce. This is because commonly used data sources for studying recruitment methods are not appropriate. For example, case studies of individual firms show how internal hiring is correlated with worker characteristics, but not with firm characteristics (Baker et al., 1994).==== The contribution of this paper is to document, in a representative sample, the importance of search for internal candidates and examine whether patterns in data conform to competing theories.====To measure employer search behavior, we exploit a survey on management practices conducted in 2019 in 28 countries of the European Union. The European Company Survey (ECS) is a unique cross-industry data set covering 21,000 establishments, which allows us to reveal the prevalence of and reasons behind certain Human Resources practices (HR). The survey covers hiring methods, work organization, incentive schemes and training. The outcome of interest is the response to the question: ==== 66% respond ==== or ====. Only 9% declare never looking for internal candidates. In comparison, in their study of the Swedish labor market, Lazear and Oyer (2004) find that 42% to 88% of jobs are filled internally depending on occupations. Our evidence shows, across countries and industries, that searching for internal candidates is a common recruiting practice.====We isolate HR practices and then establishment characteristics to explain the frequency of internal search using ordered probit models. We report marginal effects for models that include sector and country fixed effects. Accordingly, our results show how different HR practices and establishment characteristics predict the frequency of internal search, controlling for country-specific and sector-specific variations. We first investigate whether training policies complement internal hiring. We find that establishments that train their workers through on-the-job training, i.e., any form of direct instruction by more experienced colleagues, search more for internal candidates when hiring. There is no such association with other types of training, such as training sessions during paid working time. To better understand the role of training policies, we investigate what drives the decision to train employees. Developing firm-specific and job-specific skills are positively associated with internal search. In contrast, improving employee motivation through training is not associated with internal search. Our results suggest that search for internal candidates is associated with training policies that aim to develop firm-specific skills as predicted by human capital theory (Becker, 1964).====Reassignments and promotions within firms can also promote work incentives. Encouraging workers’ efforts through competition, as in a tournament, is one potential channel to promote incentives (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). The main theoretical argument is that opening vacant positions to external candidates reduces the chance of promotion for incumbent employees and, therefore, their incentives (Chan, 1996). Although this idea is difficult to test, such a mechanism is expected to be at play in workplaces where individual incentive schemes are particularly valuable. This is not the case in workplaces in which the need for collaboration between employees is prevalent. In contrast, ordered probit estimates show that employers are more likely to search internally in establishments where employees work in teams. However, the overall motivation of employees and different incentive practices are positively associated with internal search.==== This finding is consistent with the view that incentive schemes and internal hiring are correlated, but competition between employees is possibly not the main answer to rationalize internal hiring.====Finally, we investigate how employer search for internal candidates is associated with other establishment characteristics. Employers search less internally in the professional service sector relative to the manufacturing sector. Professional and technical services activities represent 7.4% of employment in 1995, and 13.1% in 2019. Differences in recruitment methods across sectors suggest that the transformation of European economies towards more services possibly explains the decline in internal hiring, as documented in Maurin and Signorelli (2019). We also find that reducing the level of competitiveness in the product market reduces the probability of searching internally. ==== Hiring methods have received a growing interest outside of personnel economics over the past few years since they offer new perspectives on important issues, such as unemployment, wage inequality or government policies.====Most of the recent empirical work focus on “formal” recruitment policies: posting an advertisement and soliciting job applicants. For example, Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2021) find that faster hiring goes along with higher search effort, lower hiring standards and more generous wages. In contrast, this paper contributes to the literature on “informal” recruiting methods (Kuhn, 2018). Existing empirical work describes the prevalence, the characteristics of workers, and wage changes associated with this recruitment method (Doeringer, 1986, Waldman, 2013). Reviewing the literature, DeVaro (2020) argues that there is a lack of empirical evidence on the reasons for internal hiring. Scarcity of evidence on this topic is caused by the fact that most empirical contributions use data of a single firm (Bidwell and Mollick, 2015) and, therefore, cannot relate firm heterogeneity to employer search behavior.====Bayo-Moriones and Ortín-Ángel (2006) is the closest study. However, their empirical setting is specific, limiting the external validity of the results.====The rich data that we leverage, containing more than 21,000 observations with various dimensions of HR practices and establishment characteristics, allow us to shed light on the determinants of internal hiring for the first time to our knowledge.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the survey data set and the econometric model. Section 3 presents the empirical results.

We study the effects of such skill-altering technological change in the context of men’s professional tennis, which was unexpectedly transformed by the invention of composite racquets during the late 1970s. We explore the consequences of this innovation on player productivity, entry, and exit. We find that young players benefited at the expense of older players and that the disruptive effects of the new racquets persisted over two to four generations.","The last two centuries have witnessed an enormous amount of technological innovation, and this is widely viewed as the primary source of long-run economic growth and improvements in well-being. At the same time, at least since Ricardo, economists have recognized that innovation can also be disruptive. As Acemoglu (2002) vividly states, “in nineteenth-century Britain, skilled artisans destroyed weaving, spinning, and threshing machines during the Luddite and Captain Swing riots, in the belief that the new machines would make their skills redundant. They were right: the artisan shop was replaced by the factory and later by interchangeable parts and the assembly line.” New technologies disrupt the labor market when they raise the returns to some skills while making others less valuable or obsolete.====We develop a theory, inspired by MacDonald and Weisbach (2004), of this phenomenon, which we call skill-altering technical change. Our theory emphasizes that workers endogenously invest in a portfolio of skills over their life cycle. We show that new technologies that change the relative values of skills can hurt older workers, who have spent a lifetime investing in the old, ideal skill mix, and better workers, who, by definition, possess more of the skills that were previously more valuable. We find that, depending on the elasticity of demand for workers’ output, the effect of a new technology can either increase or decrease exit rates and cross-sectional inequality. Moreover, the specter of future, skill-altering change makes current human capital investment risky, especially investment in specialized skills.====To test our model’s predictions empirically and quantify the effects of skill-altering technical change, we exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men’s professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These new racquets drastically changed the way the game was played, increasing the importance of hitting with spin and power relative to control. There are four reasons this episode in men’s professional tennis is a useful setting to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers. First, we have detailed panel data on multiple cohorts of individual workers (players), allowing us to track the impacts of skill-altering change over multiple generations of workers. Such data is difficult to obtain in most settings. Second, the new technology arrived suddenly and unexpectedly and was adopted universally within a few years. This is valuable because the timing of the innovation is obvious, the speed of the transition reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results, and this particular innovation was specific to tennis, thereby minimizing concerns about general equilibrium effects. Third, tennis careers are short—six years on average and rarely more than fifteen years—which allows us to follow multiple cohorts of players over their entire careers. Another advantage of short careers is that it further reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results. Fourth, since we can observe the performance of a player without worrying about the effects of teammates, professional tennis offers unusually clean measures of worker productivity.====We find that the introduction of the new composite racquets substantially disrupted the tour, with repercussions lasting for between two and four generations. It temporarily reduced the rank correlation in player quality over time, helped younger players at the expense of older ones, reduced the average age of tennis players, and increased exit rates of older players relative to younger ones. We find that inter-generational inequality rose, though we find mixed evidence for the new racquets’ effects on cross-sectional inequality. We also consider competing explanations, but we conclude that they cannot explain many of the other patterns we find. Moreover, when we compare the ages of tennis players with other Olympic athletes, we do not find a similar drop in the ages of Olympic athletes during the same time period.====While tennis provides an ideal setting for documenting skill-altering technical change, the phenomenon extends far beyond tennis. Consider the case of farmers during the mid-twentieth century. It is difficult to overstate the effect of the rise of tractors on the nature of farming. While tractors made all farmers more productive, they also had subtler effects on optimal farming practices. With a tractor, the traditional approach to farming, which relied on work animals, gave way to new farming techniques that relied on machines. Thus, farmers who had spent a lifetime investing in animal husbandry skills saw the value of their skills eroded by the arrival of tractors. As another example, consider the development of computer-aided drafting in architecture during the 1980s, discussed in MacDonald and Weisbach (2004). This new software devalued drafting and engineering skills relative to artistic skills when designing new buildings. Older architects found the transition difficult, with the ==== reporting that “as young architects plunge into the high-tech tide, older colleagues wade in gingerly.”==== In both examples, the new technology altered the relative value of different skills in an occupation. Consistent with skill-altering technical change, Fig. 1 shows that the average age in those occupations fell temporarily relative to the general population just after the new technology arrived.====This paper contributes to the literature on skills and technological change, and to the more recent literature on the effects of labor demand shocks on workers. A large literature has explored the evidence and consequences of skill-biased technical change (SBTC), which Autor et al., 2008 define as “any introduction of a new technology...that increases the demand for more-skilled labor relative to less-skilled labor at fixed relative wages.” In contrast, the phenomenon we identify—skill-altering technical change—is the introduction of a technology that raises the demand for, or productivity of, one skill relative to another at fixed implicit (skill-specific) wages. Whereas models of SBTC make predictions about wage differences between, for example, college and non-college educated workers, our model of skill-altering change primarily makes predictions about wage differences between more- and less-experienced workers. Furthermore, because skill-altering technical change focuses on differential effects of technical change over the life cycle, it allows us to address intergenerational inequality and exit decisions. This allows us to address a puzzle Card and DiNardo, 2002 identify; “SBTC also fails to explain...the age gradient in the return to education” which we explain as resulting from a change in which skills are valued rather than a change in the general value of skill. Moreover, while the prospect of future SBTC raises returns to human capital investment, the prospect of future skill-altering change discourages human capital investment. Thus, while skill-biased and skill-altering change are not mutually exclusive phenomenon, they are conceptually distinct and offer distinct empirical predictions.====We build most closely on four papers that measure how the introduction of technology affects workers. Akerman et al. (2015) use the exogenous roll-out of broadband internet in Norway, Gaggl and Wright, 2017 use variation induced by an unexpected U.K. tax credit for small firms which invested in information and communication technology, Hanssen (2020) uses the transition to sound motion pictures, and Horton and Tambe (2020) use the transition away from Flash. We also build on Gannaway et al., 2014, who investigate the effects of a new technology in professional sports—the three-point line in NBA basketball. We build on these papers by introducing a model of skill-altering technological change and using panel data to trace its effects on workers over time, and examining how the effects differ based on worker experience.====The structure of the paper is as follows. We explain the nature of the technological shock in men’s tennis in Section 2, and introduce our model in Section 3. In Section 4 we use this model to understand how players are affected by the introduction of a skill-altering technology. We introduce our data in Section 5 and describe how we estimate player quality using this data in Section 6. We test the predictions of the model in Section 7 and discuss our results and limitations in Section 8.

This paper focuses on the integration of families seeking asylum in Germany between 2013 and 2016. Exploiting regional differences in early childhood education and care (ECEC) services and dispersal policies as exogenous sources of variation, as well as controlling for local level heterogeneity that could drive the results, we estimate the effect of ==== attendance by refugee children on their parents’ integration. We find a significant positive effect, especially for the integration of mothers. The size of the estimate is substantial and is particularly strong for improved language proficiency and employment prospects.","The number of refugees living in European countries increased dramatically in the mid-2010s, with EU countries receiving almost five million asylum applications between 2013 and 2018 (Eurostat 2019). In Germany alone, close to one million refugees entered the country in the second half of 2015 (BAMF 2016). This influx had important repercussions on public policy. Measures were implemented, first, to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees and, then, to integrate them into the host countries.====Using data from Germany, this study focuses on early childhood education and care (ECEC) as a potential factor contributing to the integration of refugee families. By providing care and early education to children below the compulsory school age, ECEC services have the potential to reach many refugee families, who often have very young children (e.g. Gambaro et al., 2018). Indeed approximately 144,000 refugee children under the age of seven arrived in German with their families between January 2014 and December 2017.==== Moreover, refugee women tend to display high fertility soon after arrival, making the provision of ECEC particularly relevant for them (Liebig and Tronstad 2018).====There is wide consensus that ECEC services can help the acquisition of the host-country language amongst migrant children with a different first-language. Indeed, research documents positive effects of ECEC on children's outcomes, suggesting that migrant children stand to gain disproportionately from ECEC attendance (amongst others, Bleakley and Chin 2008; Cornelissen et al., 2018; Drange and Telle 2015; Felfe and Lalive 2018).==== By contrast, relatively little attention has been dedicated to the specific benefits ECEC may provide to migrant ====. One exception is the study of Norway by Drange and Telle (2015), who find no effects of immigrant children's ECEC attendance on their parents’ integration, measured by employment and education. In this paper, we contribute to this emerging literature and investigate the unique position of refugee parents and the role of ECEC provision for their integration.====Refugees are a particularly vulnerable group of migrants. Especially in the first years after arrival, they typically have worse health, poorer language skills, and much lower employment rates than other migrant groups with otherwise similar characteristics (Dustmann et al., 2017; Fasani et al., 2018). In addition, dispersal policies, which apply to refuges but not to migrants, can make refugees feel socially isolated (Fasani et al., 2018). Therefore, we hypothesize that refugees with young children are likely to benefit from their children's participation in ECEC in several ways. First, they are likely to profit from the social contacts that ECEC participation potentially brings. Regular interactions with ECEC staff and other parents are likely to give refugees the opportunity to practice the host country language and foster job search networks (Dustmann et al., 2017; OECD 2016). Indeed, most surveyed refugees who have recently arrived in Germany and are employed report having found their job through social contacts (Eisnecker and Schacht 2016). Second, parents whose children are enroled in ECEC may develop familiarity with the culture of the host country by seeing their children learning the language, celebrating local traditions, and possibly enjoying attending a host-country community setting such as an ECEC centre (e.g. Dustmann 1996; Avitabile et al., 2013). Third, as with all parents, ECEC services relieve refugees, especially mothers, from child care duties, freeing up time to participate in employment or training courses as well as to actively engage in the integration process (e.g. Müller and Wrohlich, 2020).====To estimate the impact of ECEC attendance by refugee children on the integration of their parents, we have the advantage of drawing on a large, recent survey, providing data from a nationally representative sample of refugees who applied for asylum in Germany between 2013 and 2016. This dataset includes a rich set of information on pre- and post-migration characteristics of the respondents and of their family members, including children. Using geographical identifiers, we link this survey data to administrative data on local ECEC services, capturing variation across lower administrative levels (counties) within federal states. We further augment our data with administrative information on the economic and institutional characteristics of the county where survey respondents live.====Our estimation strategy exploits the fact that refugees arriving in Germany are randomly dispersed, first across federal states, then within each respective state to ensure an even distribution throughout the country. As a consequence of this dispersal policy, the communities where refugees settle differ greatly along several dimensions. One dimension relevant to families with children under school age regards the availability and characteristics of ECEC services, which may make it more or less likely that refugee children attend a centre. Our estimation strategy uses German dispersal policy and the geographical differences in ECEC services as exogenous source of variation: by applying a factor-based instrumental variable (IV) approach, we avoid bias from selection into ECEC and we are able to offer the first estimates that support a causal interpretation of the association between refugee children’ participation in ECEC and the integration of their parents.====A further contribution of our study is that we capture different dimensions of integration. Through a principal component analysis, we construct an integration index that combines the information contained in twelve survey items, spanning the domains of economic, cultural, and social integration. Our results show that ECEC participation of refugee children substantially affects the integration of their mothers, whereas we cannot detect significant effects for fathers. The integration of parents whose children attend ECEC is significantly higher than the integration of parents with children not attending ECEC, with the difference equivalent to 22% of the average integration of the sample. The IV estimate shows that the integration boost given by ECEC enrolment for mothers is about 67%, which is equivalent to living in Germany for more than six years. Examining the individual items underlying the integration index, we show that the effects are particularly strong for self-assessed language proficiency and the perceived probability of future employment in Germany.====We extensively test the validity of our instrument and the robustness of our results. In particular, we control for the county level average integration of refugees without children and of refugees with school aged children only. The integration of these two groups is arguably affected by the overall suitability of the local context but cannot directly benefit from ECEC provision. Indeed, we run a placebo test of the effect of our instrument (an index that summarizes different dimensions of the county level ECEC supply) on the integration of refugees without children or with children of school age only and show that it does not have a significant relationship with their integration. Finally, we exploit the longitudinal nature of the survey and estimate a model including individual fixed effects on the sample of families that participated in two survey waves. The panel results confirm that ECEC enrolment of refugee children has a positive and significant effect on the integration of their mothers, whereas estimates were not significant for fathers.====Our results provide new evidence on the integration of refuge families in a European country. In particular, they show how ECEC services hold the potential to support the integration of not only, as conventionally assumed, refugee children, but of their parents too. Our findings also call for greater attention to the distinct circumstances of refugee mothers relative to their male counterparts.",The effect of early childhood education and care services on the integration of refugee families,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000889,4 September 2021,2021,Research Article,171.0

We shed light on the correlates of local sexism and find that the most important factors that predict it are the economic outcomes of men. Finally, we show that online sexism is associated with higher levels of the residual gender wage gap, the wage gap after controlling for education, occupation, ","Hostile sexism invokes explicitly negative beliefs about women and can be difficult to capture in survey data due to individuals’ reluctance to reveal their true beliefs. This paper develops a new measure of hostile sexism in the U.S. using publicly available Google Trends data which incorporates multiple dimensions of sexism. After explaining the construction of the index and the underlying Google data, we then use this new measure to study the association between hostile sexism and the gender wage gap.====Google data provides several advantages over previous measures constructed exclusively with the General Social Survey (GSS) (Charles et al., 2009, 2018). First, it identifies sexism at a more local level, providing a larger sample size compared to studies that examine labor market outcomes of women at the state level. Second, it is based on searches that occur mostly in private. In contrast, the GSS collects data with face-to-face interviews, a method that may understate an individual's sexism due to social censoring (Bound et al., 2001; Tourangeau and Yan, 2007; Berinsky, 1999, 2002).====The work most closely related to ours is Charles et al. (2018) who study sexism, the gender wage gap, and household decisions of women across states, measuring attitudes about women with survey responses from the General Social Survey (GSS). However, we approach the same issue with a different method for measuring sexism that relies on Google search data. This allows us to study sexism and the wage gap in a media market, a smaller geographic area than a state. This is appealing intuitively because a media market more closely resembles a local labor market than a state. Especially in large states, there can be significant variation in wage gaps and culture across media markets in the same state. For example, in Odessa, TX, we estimate that the average woman with the same education, occupation, and industry earns 76 cents for every dollar the average man earns. In Austin, the average woman earns 82 cents for every dollar earned by a comparable man.====There is also considerable variation in hostile sexism across media markets, with the most sexist areas having sexism levels that are three standard deviations above the mean and the least sexist areas having levels that are four standard deviations below the mean. Interestingly, we find that some of the most important predictors of hostile sexism are related to the economic outcomes of men. Lower levels of college attainment for men, lower labor force participation rates, and lower rates of employment are all associated with higher levels of hostile sexism. Those same outcomes for women are also associated with sexism, but are less informative in predicting it.====Overall, we find that including our newly developed index in the estimation of the wage gap between white men and white women that exists after controlling for education, occupation, industry, and age narrows the gap. This result is consistent with discrimination and we find corroborating evidence that sexism is related to discrimination by showing larger correlations in circumstances in which discrimination would be less costly. The seminal work of Becker (1971) predicts that sexism may decrease a woman's relative wage by causing disutility among employers, co-workers, or customers who interact with women. However, discrimination could be less prevalent in competitive markets because employers who choose to pay to discriminate may be driven out. (See, for example, Blau and Khan, 2017; Janssen et al., 2016; or Hirsch et al., 2010.)====Consistent with the idea that the extent of discrimination that occurs is influenced by its economic costs and benefits, we find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap in less competitive labor markets. We assess the competitiveness of labor markets with worker characteristics such as education, industry, and gender and find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap in less competitive industries, in industries in which workers are more likely to directly interact with customers, and in industries with a smaller share of female workers. Furthermore, we also find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap for workers without college education. Finally, we find that sexism is associated with lower wages of women and somewhat weaker evidence that it is associated with higher wages of men.====There may also be an indirect correlation because sexism can influence the non-labor market choices of women, such as marriage and having children and hostile sexism is correlated with these household decisions as well. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) predict that utility from household decisions depends on the extent an outcome is consistent with identity. Norms in more sexist areas may reinforce a more traditional female identity, and women in these areas may feel compelled to pursue household decisions traditionally associated with being female. (See, for example, Bertrand et al., 2015 or Fernandez and Fogli, 2009).==== Consistent with this idea, we find that in more sexist areas, women are more likely to marry, have children, and spend more time at home relative to men.====Because we exploit geographic variation in the wage gap, household decisions, and sexism within the U.S. to obtain our results, our work is also closely related to the strand of the literature that examines how household decisions and economic outcomes of women vary geographically within the U.S. Many have studied the evolution of household decisions and economic outcomes of women through time (e.g., Bailey et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2019; Black and Spitz-Oener, 2010). In contrast, relatively few examine how household decisions and economic outcomes of women vary geographically within the U.S. Beaudry and Lewis (2014) study the change in the gender wage gap over the 1980 – 2000 time period using cross-city differences, attributing a decline in the wage gap over this time period to the adoption of computers. Black et al. (2014) explain the cross-city difference in the labor supply of married women with variation in commuting times.====We proceed by first explaining the construction of the measures of sexism and the wage gap in Section 2. Section 3 explains our methods and presents results for the correlations between sexism and the wage gap. Section 4 examines the correlation between sexism and male and female wages and considers alternative explanations for our results.

In the first four months of the pandemic period (March-June 2020) the average month-over-month nonresponse rate increased by 58 percent, while the size of newly entering cohorts declined by 37 percent relative to the prior 15 months. Together, these factors reduced the overall sample size of the CPS by around 16 percent. We hypothesize that these changes, and significant associated shifts in the demographic composition of the sample, were caused by the cessation of in-person interviewing. Geographic variation in nonresponse over this period does not appear related to variation in COVID case rates across metro areas or states.

In an exercise generating a counterfactual group of “missing” respondents, we estimate that, between April and August of 2020, the average unemployment rate was 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points higher, and the labor force participation rate was 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points lower than estimates using the actual sample of respondents. One implication of these results is that web-based surveys, which are increasingly relied on in empirical labor market studies, may fail to reach important subpopulations of the labor market and that reweighting is unlikely to address the selection on outcomes we document.","Since the late 1940s, Current Population Survey (CPS) household survey data has been a primary measure of the health of the U.S. labor market (====). It has served as a key data source for policymakers, as well as for thousands of social science studies in the last half-century. But the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to the CPS data collection process and, in turn, for the representativeness of the resulting data. During the pandemic, the size of the CPS sample declined by approximately 16 percent, driven primarily by a 37 percent decline in the size of entering cohorts over a period of several months.====One prime candidate for these changes is an unprecedented change in interview method. In order to adhere to social distancing protocol, in-person interviewing was officially suspended by the Census Bureau on March 20====, 2020 (====).====We also test for evidence of an alternate channel for these patterns, namely that geographic variation in the intensity of COVID cases may have driven this increased nonresponse, but we do not find evidence that such variation was an important factor. Instead, the evidence is consistent with a causal link running from interview method to both respondent demographic characteristics and labor market outcomes.====We explore the link between interview method and respondent characteristics by making use of the fact that cohorts of respondents surveyed over the same months of the pandemic vary in whether they entered the survey in a period prior to the pandemic via an in-person interviewing option or during the pandemic months when in-person interviewing was suspended. Our analyses indicate that after in-person interviewing was suspended, survey participation among prime-aged respondents in the absence of in-person interviewing was positively correlated with ==== and employment. However, this was not true for all respondents. For those who initially responded to the survey only in the second or later months of their assigned survey rotation, which we use as a proxy for requiring additional effort being required on the part of field representatives to secure respondent participation, we estimate higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of labor force participation. Without narrowing the focus to prime-aged respondents, this pattern appears to go in the opposite direction due to a significant shift toward relatively older respondents entering the survey in cohorts recruited after in-person interviewing was suspended.====In what we view as a conservative counterfactual exercise, we randomly draw a pool of “missing” prime-aged respondents from a subsample of these harder-to-recruit respondents in a manner that balances the composition of the overall sample selected during the pandemic months according to race/ethnicity, age, income, gender, and education. Using this alternate sample, we estimate modestly higher rates of both unemployment and labor force participation, suggesting that potential respondents who experienced employment shocks during the pandemic were less likely to participate in the survey in the absence of in-person interviewing.====This study relates to a large existing literature on survey nonresponse. A comprehensive summary of issues related to nonresponse in the CPS and other key labor market and demographic surveys is beyond the scope of this article, but we point interested readers to Meyer, Mok and Sullivan (2015) for a thorough overview of the subject.==== This study is among a very small body of work we are aware of investigating the effects of the pandemic on nonresponse in the CPS and the first study we are aware of to focus on how the change in interview method affected the monthly survey data.====Our primary aim in writing this article is to highlight how the interview method used in social and demographic surveys affects the characteristics of respondents. One important upshot of our results is that web-based surveys, which have been used extensively during the COVID pandemic and are used increasingly in a wide variety of settings across the social sciences, may be unlikely to reach important subgroups in the labor market and may, thus, fail to be representative of the population at large, even with survey weighting.","CPS Nonresponse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Explanations, Extent, and Effects",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000956,3 September 2021,2021,Research Article,173.0

I investigate the effect of changes in the minimum wage on high school dropout decisions. Consistently across two sources of variation and three individual-level datasets, I find that increases in the minimum wage substantially reduce the dropout likelihood of low-socioeconomic status (SES) teens but have no effect on other teens.","The economic literature on the consequences of the minimum wage is both vast and contentious. Researchers concentrate mainly on the possible disemployment effects of the minimum wage, frequently focusing on teens, the age group most subject to the minimum wage.==== Much less attention has been paid to the policy’s impact on teen educational investments, despite the growing literature finding substantial effects of labor demand shocks on educational attainment (Atkin, 2016, Cascio and Narayan, 2015, Charles, Hurst, Notowidigdo, 2018)5 and the primary importance generally accorded to teen educational attainment over teen employment by policymakers. I contribute to this literature by using multiple data sources and sources of variation in concert to establish the causal effect of minimum wage changes on the educational choices of high-risk teens.====While the effect of the minimum wage on educational investment is indirect, it is an intuitive byproduct of a simple model of human capital investment where teens decide whether to drop out of high school by weighing their opportunity cost and psychic cost of schooling against the expected future return to earning a high school diploma. To the extent that changes in the minimum wage alter the teen labor market (Neumark and Wascher, 2008), these changes will also alter the opportunity cost of schooling and therefore their dropout decision. Furthermore, to the extent that returns to a high school diploma increase more steeply with ability for higher socio-economic status (SES) teens (e.g. due to better school quality, job networks, or likelihood of proceeding to higher education) or the distribution of ability differs by socio-economic status (e.g. due to differences in parental investments or accumulated past exposure to school quality), then we would expect the impacts of a minimum wage change on high school dropout decisions to differ dramatically by SES.====I investigate the impact of changes in the minimum wage on high school dropout decisions using two distinct sources of variation and three individual-level datasets. I use two decades of the Current Population Survey (CPS), one decade of the American Community Survey (ACS), and the 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 4-year panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). To identify the effect of a minimum wage change, I leverage both variation in minimum wage rates within states over time and variation in minimum wage rates between neighboring localities on either side of a state border at a given point in time. Each of these sources of data and variation have their own advantages and disadvantages in measuring the educational effect of minimum wage changes. I use them in concert to address a variety of internal validity threats that would not be possible to address with only one source of data and variation.====Consistently across data sources, sources of variation, and empirical specifications, I find that an increase in the minimum wage lowers the likelihood that low-SES teens will drop out of high school but has no effect on the likelihood of drop out for other teens. The effect on low-SES teens, who have a higher ==== dropout rate, is substantial. I find that a ten percent increase in the minimum wage, equivalent to an increase of 73 cents per hour at the current federal minimum, lowers the likelihood of dropping out by 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points, or between four and ten percent of the average dropout rate for the low-SES group.====Taken together, my results suggest that the focus of prior research on the teen employment effects of the minimum wage may have missed part of the larger picture of this policy’s impact on teens. While increasing the minimum wage may reduce contemporaneous teen employment outcomes, it may also increase the future productivity and labor market prospects for teens from low-SES families, making the long-run effects on this group far less clear.",The minimum wage and teen educational attainment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000968,2 September 2021,2021,Research Article,174.0

We utilize the introduction of a minimum wage of South Korea in 1988 and exploit a data covering the universe of new plants subject to this law. From difference-in-differences analyses, we first confirm that the introduction of the minimum wage caused new plants to remit higher remuneration to workers. Due to the minimum wage, new plants tended to start with fewer employees and to equip their employees with more capital. Finally, we find that the minimum wage led to higher labor productivity among entering plants.","A minimum wage is a form of labor regulation in which a state or a local government sets and regulates the lowest amount of remuneration that employers must pay to workers. As the regulation is imposed on employers, observing their response to the minimum wage helps to predict the economic consequences of the minimum wage, such as changes in employment. For this reason, many economists have examined the impact of a minimum wage using firm or establishment-level data (Bossler and Gerner, 2020; Card and Krueger, 1994; Neumark and Wascher, 2000; Dube et al., 2007; Skedinger, 2006; Haepp and Lin, 2017; Gan et al., 2016; Luca and Luca, 2019; Fan et al., 2018).====A vast majority of the existing studies employing employer-based data focus on firms that were operating before a change in the minimum wage policy arrives. In other words, the literature explored how ==== firms make decisions to exit from the market and to adjust their employment, labor productivity, profitability or prices in response to a change in the minimum wage (Aaronson et al., 2008; Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019; Huang et al., 2014; Stewart and Swaffield, 2008; Draca etal., 2011; Riley and Rosazza Bondibene 2017).====This paper contributes to this strand of the literature by focusing on the effect of the minimum wage on ==== establishments and their characteristics. Due to the employment protection law and other adjustment costs stemming from the putty-clay nature of technology, incumbent firms are less likely swiftly to adjust certain aspects, such as their employment or capital intensity, in response to a change in the minimum wage (Sorkin, 2015; Johansen, 1959). In contrast, new firms have more flexibility when choosing an input mix between labor and capital or can even reconsider whether to enter the market in the first place (Williamson, 1968; Bachmann et al., 2014). The aspects of the minimum wage impact on new firms allow us to draw implications regarding the long-term effects of the minimum wage because the changing composition of entering firms would gradually be reflected in aggregate indicators (Aaronson et al., 2018). However, despite its importance, only a few empirical studies have validated this theoretical prediction.====We exploit the introduction of the minimum wage in South Korea in 1988 to identify the impact of the minimum wage on new plants. In particular, we compare changes in the characteristics of new plants in more affected sectors with those in less affected sectors. Because the employer bears the labor cost, the minimum wage would have more ‘bite’ on low-paying sectors. We use the remuneration to workers prior to the introduction of minimum wage to capture the heterogeneous degrees of exposure to the minimum wage across sectors.==== To be more specific, we define the intensity of the treatment at the sector-level using the fraction of firms for which the average wage to workers was below the initial minimum wage. We then apply a generalized difference-in-differences framework to repeated cross-sectional data of new plants to explore the causal effect of the introduction of the minimum wage on various characteristics of new plants.====First, we confirm that the introduction of the minimum wage in Korea in 1988 was a binding regulation for entering businesses. Specifically, we document that the average remuneration to workers at new plants increased as a result of the minimum wage introduction. We then show that new plants in sectors highly exposed to the minimum wage started with fewer employees. This stands in contrast with the findings of Baek and Park (2016), who showed that the introduction of the minimum wage did not negatively affect the employment of existing plants. Another finding helps explain the smaller employment size of new plants. These firms adopted capital-intensive technology—i.e., a higher capital-to-labor ratio—as a response to the introduction of the minimum wage.====We also find an improvement in labor productivity at new plants. The increased capital intensity may be part of the cause, and the positive self-selection mechanism could have been working as well; only entrepreneurs who could make more out of workers chose to enter the market after the introduction of the minimum wage. Our findings on the productivity of new plants are in line with recent findings showing that the minimum wage could enhance the overall efficiency of an economy by improving the productivity of incumbent firms and forcing less productive firms to exit the market (Riley and Rosazza Bondibene 2017; Luca and Luca, 2019).====We make two distinct contributions to the firm-level studies of minimum wages. First, our results are based on data that cover all firms which have been subject to the introduction of the minimum wage. As will be explained in detail in the following sections, the minimum wage in Korea was initially applied to establishments with ten or more employees in the manufacturing sector, and our dataset covers not a sample but the universe of establishments meeting this criterion. This makes our estimates, based on the population of plants subject to the introduction, more representative than those in previous studies that use samples of firms. Most firm-level analyses tend to underrepresent the firms being affected by the minimum wage due to the nature of firm-level surveys. While those affected firms tend to be small, detailed firm-level information, such as that pertaining to revenue, wage, and employment, is much more readily available for sufficiently large firms.==== Therefore, compared to previous works employing firm-level data, our work is less likely to suffer from bias stemming from the underrepresentation of firms being affected by the minimum wage.====Second, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to examine the impact of the minimum wage on certain characteristics—i.e. employment, capital intensity, and labor productivity—of new establishments entering the market. A few papers have examined the impact of the minimum wage on firm's decisions with regard to whether or not to enter the market. Using the state minimum wage increase in the U.S., Rohlin (2011) finds that the minimum wage negatively affects the entry of new establishments measured by the share of the new business birth. On the other hand, Aaronson et al. (2018) documents an increase in restaurant entries following the state minimum wage hikes in the U.S.====This paper explores the impact of the minimum wage on various characteristics of plants that have chosen to enter the market. This allows us to draw detailed implications regarding the long-term consequences of the introduction of the minimum wage. In particular, we document that capital deepening was as a potentially important channel by which to improve the productivity of entering firms. Therefore, the introduction of the minimum wage would have caused an increase in per-worker output at the cost of an employment reduction over the long run.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information about the introduction of the minimum wage in South Korea. Section 3 provides a description of the data used in the analysis, followed by a discussion on the empirical model. Section 4 presents the main result along with various robustness checks.

However, there is little causal evidence about the effects of training on firms. This paper studies a large training grants programme supported by the ====, contrasting firms in Portugal that received the grants and others that also applied but were unsuccessful. Combining several rich data sets, we compare a large number of potential outcomes of these firms, while following them over several years both before and after the grant decision. Our difference-in-differences models estimate significant positive effects on take up (training hours and expenditure), with limited deadweight; and that such additional training led to increased sales, value added, employment, productivity, and exports. These effects tend to be of at least 5% and, in some cases, 10% or more, and are robust in multiple dimensions.","As technology evolves more rapidly, firm-provided employee training can play an increasingly important role. Training can update and extend the schooling qualifications of workers in their jobs and deliver important private and social benefits. The pandemic crisis may also represent an opportunity for firms to invest in the skills of their workers in the context of growing importance of remote work. However, employee training also faces a number of well-known obstacles. These include worker mobility, namely through poaching by other firms, and credit constraints for firms to fund the direct and indirect costs of training. Such obstacles can lead to sub-optimal levels of this particular type of human capital investment (Leuven, 2005).====Even if the obstacles above can be addressed, firms may find it difficult to estimate the returns to their training activities. Training sessions may be more or less effective; and the relationship between human capital improvements and gains in productivity and sales may be difficult to establish, leading to uncertainty that can further discourage training. This point is further underlined by the fact that the academic literature on the firm-level returns to employee training has not yet drawn on experimental or quasi-experimental variation. All approaches adopted so far are based on assumptions about the production technology of firms (Almeida, Carneiro, 2009, Konings, Vanormelingen, 2015, Mehra, Langer, Bapna, Gopal, 2014), controls for firm heterogeneity, including firm fixed effects (Barrett, O’Connell, 2001, Dostie, 2018, Goux, Maurin, 2000, Zwick, 2006) or case studies of single or small numbers of firms (Krueger, Rouse, 1998, Lyons, 2020). As stated in Fialho et al. (2019), ’it is very difficult to measure the returns to training [for employers] and very few studies have attempted to estimate it’ (page 24). Brunello and Wruuck (2020) also highlight this point and argue that a ’more systematic assessment of the benefits [of training for firms] could contribute to explain the heterogeneity in training investment’ (page 29).====In contrast to the literature above, this paper is one of the first to provide evidence on the effects of employee training on firm performance based on potentially quasi-experimental variation, even if not drawing on a randomised control trial. The variation in training across firms that we use here is drawn from a large, 200 million euro training grants programme supported by the European Social Fund of the European Union. This programme, FIG, implemented in Portugal, supported the training of employees of different skill levels, from factory workers to managers, and in diverse areas, including innovation, marketing, and international trade (Bloom, Manova, Van Reenen, Sun, Yu, Bloom, Reenen, 2007). FIG involved five annual calls between 2007 and 2011, all studied here, each one receiving applications from about 2000 firms. As demand exceeded the funding available, less than half of the applicants were selected and funded, receiving a grant of about 30,000 euros on average. While assignment to treatment is not random (and in, that sense, our study is observational), variation in treatment status is influenced by the changing circumstances of each call, namely the funding available, the number of firms applying for support, and the binding (or not) nature of minimum scores, as explained in detail in the next section.====Our analysis is based on matching the administrative data from all applicants in each call to a rich matched employer-employee panel. This allows us to follow both the funded and the rejected firms, using difference-in-differences (Lechner, 2011), and drawing on a more comparable (self-selected) set of firms. We follow these firms over a period of up to ten years before their application and up to ten years after the funding was or was not awarded. (Our approach bears some similarity to Holzer et al. (1993), which studies a training programme in Michigan, and Howell (2017), which studies an R&D programme in the US. See also Criscuolo et al. (2019) which studies the effects of an industrial policy in the UK, which can also include worker training components.) Moreover, we consider a very large number of potential firm-level outcomes, all of which collected from the same compulsory surveys across firms and years, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of training. Some of these variables have not been examined before in the training literature. We also examine the effects of training at different times over the business cycle, which strengthens the external validity of our findings.====Our findings indicate that, first, the training grants had a significant positive effect on training activities: both training expenditure and training hours more than double. This increase also involved limited deadweight loss: we estimate that at least 74% of the grant led to additional training and, under some assumptions, cannot rule out some form of crowd-in (whereby the increase in training exceeded the support provided by the programme). Our finding of limited deadweight is in contrast to several studies (Abramovsky, Battistin, Fitzsimons, Goodman, Simpson, 2011, Hidalgo, Oosterbeek, Webbink, 2014, Leuven, Oosterbeek, 2004, Schwerdt, Messer, Woessmann, Wolter, 2012) but certainly not all (Goerlitz, 2010, Holzer, Block, Cheatham, Knott, 1993). Our results may be driven by the format of the programme, which required an application by interested parties (where they made their cases about the relevance of the grant) and established levels of co-payment by firms that decreased with the generality of the skills provided.====Second, we find that the additional training driven by the programme led to economically and statistically significant improvements in several dimensions of firm performance. Sales, value added, employment, productivity, and exports increase in the firms that received the training grant compared to the control group of unsuccessful applicants. On the other hand, total (accounting) investment and profits appear to not be positively affected by training, although these variables are subject to measurement error. As to the variables that increase, the effects are typically of around 10%, emerge one or two years after the grant is provided and the training is conducted, and in some cases remain in place for at least ten years. Interestingly, the employment effects we find tend to be stronger in periods of recession. This may correspond to a positive form of training ’lock-in’, in contrast to the case of training programmes for the unemployed, which may reduce transitions to employment at least in the short-run.====The large and durable positive effects in several firm performance variables and the relatively low cost of the additional training indicate that there may be significant underprovision of employee training. At the same time, the results highlight the potential of public programmes in addressing at least part of this underprovision. Quasi-experimental evidence may also go some way in informing firms regarding the likely returns from training. Our results also contribute to the evaluation of the 100 billion European Social Fund (Becker et al., 2013), of which FIG was a small component, and towards the design and implementation of the new funding schemes currently under plan to alleviate the pandemic crisis.====The structure of the remaining of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the training programme evaluated here.

To this end, I sent fictitious visit requests to more than 2,500 schools located in the ==== of Madrid (Spain). I signaled cultural assimilation of immigrant families through the parents' decision of giving their child a native name. Overall, Romanian families who gave a Spanish name to their child receive 7 % (5 p.p.) more responses than those who selected a Romanian name. Emails from families whose members have Romanian names are 12 % (9 p.p.) less likely to receive a response than those from native Spanish-named families. The results show a consistent pattern across schools with differing characteristics.","Over the last decade, discussions over immigrant assimilation have become increasingly heated in political arenas across the Western world. On the one hand, nativist politicians argue that rising multiculturalism poses a threat to the preservation of autochthonous culture and hence ensuring immigrant assimilation is essential. On the other hand, some mainstream democratic governments, such as that of Denmark, have made assimilation mandatory to grant immigrants full access to social benefits. While most liberal democracies agree to concede rights and protection to immigrants, whether assimilation should constitute a duty for accessing public services is an increasingly debated question. Yet little is known about the role that assimilation plays in immigrants' access to important services, like health or education. Do discriminatory attitudes of natives affect immigrants' access to these services? Can newcomers mitigate entry barriers to welfare services by signaling assimilation? What incentives drive such biases?====Using a field experiment, this paper addresses these questions by focusing on access to early- and compulsory-education. Education is arguably the most crucial means of easing the socioeconomic integration of first- and second-generation immigrants. First, it constitutes a fundamental engine of human capital formation and upward mobility (Chetty et al., 2011;2017, Card et al., 2018). Second, it acts as a powerful tool to inculcate shared civic values and to enhance social cohesion (Billings et al., 2014). In this study, I assess the presence of discriminatory attitudes towards immigrant families in the acquisition of school-related information, and evaluate the potential of cultural assimilation to mitigate such barriers. Before the school registration period takes place, families engage in an active process of gathering information in order to decide upon a school for their children. By selectively providing information, schools can influence their applicant pool and ""cream skim"" students by discouraging certain incoming families from enrolling their children. Although declining to provide information and denying access to a given service is not equivalent, previous evidence suggests that the former is causally linked to participation decisions (Hastings & Weinstein, 2008; Hoxby & Turner, 2013). Ultimately, this behavior can result in worsened educational outcomes for minority students through limited access to high-quality schools, thus harming their later labor market opportunities. Hence, investigating unequal treatment in the provision of information helps to reveal underlying discriminatory attitudes from schools that can significantly influence immigrant students' long-term labor market outcomes (Acemoglu & Angrist, 2001).====To quantify the size of these discriminatory frictions and study the role of immigrants' cultural assimilation on discrimination, I emailed more than 2500 kindergartens and compulsory schools located in the Community of Madrid in the period leading up to the 2018 student registration. In these messages, three types of fictitious couples, one Spanish and two Romanian, requested to visit the school.==== The respective Romanian couples signaled different levels of cultural assimilation with the origin of their child's name. Similar to other studies, I signed the emails using common Spanish- or immigrant-sounding names to evoke the different ethnic origins of the couples. Whether cultural assimilation mitigates discriminatory behavior is evaluated by testing for the presence of distinctive response patterns of the schools. To enhance the comparability across family profiles, I fix a number of socioeconomic characteristics that drive the selection into assimilation and affect discrimination. These characteristics include paternal occupation and working sector, the language proficiency of the couple, and the age-adequacy of the child.====The Spanish context provides a particularly suitable context for analyzing the aforementioned questions. From 1998–2008, the foreign-born share of the population increased by 10 percentage points. This constituted one of the most remarkable immigration periods experienced in recent history by an OECD country. With specific regard to the education system, immigration led to significant native flight towards private schools and increased student-teacher ratios in public schools (Farré et al., 2018). Moreover, this occurred after public education had been transferred from the central to regional governments, the size of the private school network had increased, and parents' freedom of choice favored (Arellano & Zamarro, 2007).====A focus on immigrant families' name choices as a proxy of assimilation provides a number of advantages relative to other widespread measures. First, studying the implications of cultural assimilation by looking at actual assimilation outcomes, like intermarriages or labor-market assimilation, can produce misleading conclusions. The reason being that such measures are equilibrium outcomes that depend on the interplay of both natives' and immigrants' actions and are therefore constrained by the stance of the native population (Fouka et al., 2021). Second, other proxies of assimilation, such as naturalization, might be affected by financial restrictions, labor market prospects, the composition of immigrants' social networks, etc. They hence can fail to disentangle assimilation from other factors associated with socioeconomic success since they may be disturbed, ultimately, by discriminatory attitudes. Name-choices, on the other hand, are unconstrained by such barriers, act as crucial markers of individual identity, and carry significant cultural content (Algan et al., 2013). At the social level, names are relevant descriptors of a family's cultural background and trigger preliminary judgments about ethnic group affiliation. Shifting towards native names manifests learning about the host culture, or making a durable choice of remaining in the country (Abramitzky et al., 2020). At the same time, names reflect a personal choice that embodies a migrant family's trade-off between transmitting their own cultural identity and adapting to the traditions of their new environment.====Several findings emerge from this analysis. First, I find that immigrants who chose a foreign (Romanian) name for their children face important discriminatory barriers in the acquisition of information (9 p.p. lower response rate relative to a baseline of a 77 % response rate for natives). Second, I show that immigrant parents' decision of giving their child a native name significantly reduces discrimination by 50 %. The emails from the Romanian couple who chose a Spanish name for their child are significantly more likely to get a response than those from the couple who selected a Romanian name (73 % as opposed to 68 % response rate). I perform a number of checks (i.e., considering the qualitative tone of the response and employing a duration analysis of the delay in response) that support the robustness of my findings.====To uncover the main mechanisms driving the results, I assess whether a diverse set of predictors explain the differences in response patterns. In particular, I consider both the characteristics of the schools and their surrounding geographical areas. At the school level, I examine attributes that are associated with higher tuition expenditures and the type of instruction. This set of characteristics includes the type of school (i.e., whether it is public, charter, or private), the age of the child, the linguistic model, and the number of extra services provided by the school. At the geographical level, I account for political preferences, incidence of Romanian immigration, and the size and housing prices of the neighborhood or municipality where the school is located. Overall, the aforementioned qualitative nature of findings remains across schools with differing characteristics. From a statistical standpoint, I find no significant heterogeneous effects in any of the considered dimensions. However, I find that response patterns display substantial variability based on these characteristics. This suggests that the findings may suffer from limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity. Altogether, the evidence is consistent with certain school level incentives (e.g., the age of the child being served) and community characteristics (e.g., relative presence of Romanian migrants) mediating observed discrimination.====The case for statistical discrimination cannot be entirely ruled out in the current setting, despite being arguably weaker than in similar audit studies focusing on the labor market. Thus, results may not be entirely attributed to prejudice or taste-based discrimination stemming from perceived cultural assimilation. In absence of direct evidence for the role of taste-based vis-à-vis statistical discrimination, some patterns suggest that the findings can be partially associated with the former. For instance, the observation that there is a larger gap between assimilated and non-assimilated families in kindergartens is consistent with perceived place of birth not being the main driver of the results. However, I cannot exclude the possibility that statistical discrimination plays a significant role in explaining the gap between assimilated and non-assimilated families. Irrespective of their causes, the findings are relevant from a regulatory perspective. Even if school staff use names as proxies for parental background, the differential treatment based on ethnically distinct names is likely to be seen by courts as a pretext for discrimination (Kline & Walters, 2020).====This paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, it speaks to the ample body of work on immigrant assimilation. An increasing number of studies have leveraged the informativeness of migrant parents' name choices as a proxy of cultural assimilation. However, most focus on understanding the labor market penalty associated with foreign-sounding names using observational data (for instance, Arai & Skogman Thoursie, 2009; Goldstein & Stecklov (2016) and Abramitzky et al., 2020). My study differs in two ways. First, it evaluates the influence of assimilation efforts on discriminatory attitudes in access to education services. Second, it concentrates on the implications of assimilation at early-life stages as opposed to evaluating outcomes observed in adulthood.====My analysis also contributes to the literature on school choice. Existing scholarship has provided ambivalent evidence regarding the impact of the latter on student stratification (Böhlmark et al., 2016; Söderström & Uusitalo (2010; Zimmer & Guarino (2013; Gortazar et al., 2020). The presence of heterogeneous preferences based on family socioeconomic characteristics has been a widely studied motive that rationalizes these findings (Burgess et al., 2015; Hastings et al., 2009; Beuermann et al., 2019). Yet little research has been conducted on the role of school ""cream skimming"" through the generating of informational frictions. This is largely due to the fact that observational studies do not allow to disentangle the two. In response to such limitations, a few studies have adopted an experimental approach to understand the active role of schools in dissuading minority students. These include, among others, Diaz-Serrano & Meix-Llop (2016) for homosexual parents in Catalonia (Spain), Pfaff et al., 2021) for religious minorities, and Bergman & McFarlin Jr. (2020) for children with poor behavior, learning disabilities, and low achievement in the US.==== To my knowledge, however, there has been no comprehensive study that quantifies specifically the role of assimilation on schools' attitudes towards migrants.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. I begin in Section 2 by introducing the institutional setting. Section 3 presents the experimental design and the data. Section 4 shows the main results. Sections 5 and 6 provide the heterogeneity analysis and the robustness checks. Section 7 discusses the limitations of the experiment and the interpretation of results.

Using French administrative data, I estimate its effect on employment growth and worker flows in eligible firms more than two years after its end. The credit had a positive effect on employment growth due to more hires. Employment growth did not fall below its pre-treatment trends after the end of the credit, meaning created jobs were not transitory. The public cost per job created is 19% of its private cost in 2012.","Hiring entails considerable costs for the employer: locating the best candidate for a position can be a time-consuming and exhausting procedure. Because of the existence of these fixed costs, certain hires that are profitable in relation to their variable costs are not made because potential employers are unwilling to pay these fixed costs on top of their variable costs. Manning (2006) reports that hiring costs in the Labour Turnover Survey conducted by the UK Institute for Personnel are between 2.4% and 11.2% of earnings. More recently, Muehlemann and Pfeifer (2016), using firm-level data from Germany, find that average hiring costs per new worker are substantial, averaging around 4700 €, or about 8 weeks of earnings. Still, hiring costs are likely to vary a lot depending on the type of firms and the economic context. They may be greater for a small business that lacks a human resources department to efficiently vet candidates. Furthermore, when the future activity or the worker’s quality is uncertain, these expenses can be amplified. Risk-averse employers may not want to take the risk of a bad fit, especially when separation costs are significant. Finally, the risk premium that an employer adds to these costs is likely to be influenced by the current economic climate.====This paper examines the introduction of a hiring credit for small firms in France in 2008, in order to give new light on how to boost employment during a crisis. This credit was not announced in advance by the French Government and therefore could not be anticipated. For 18 months, all low wage hires (lower then 1.6 times the minimum wage) in firms with less than 10 full-time equivalent workers in November 2008 were eligible to a partial refund of its employer contributions. One expects this hiring credit to increase employment in eligible firms, at least while it lasts. It could do so for three different reasons. First of all, if it is integrated by firms as a wage subsidy (a reduction of labor cost). Second, if it leads firms to change the timing of their hires to take the opportunity of the credit (a displacement effect). Third, if it is integrated by firms as an adjustment subsidy and leads them to hire more (but also to terminate more employment relationships). The actual source of job creation will matter for the sustainability of jobs created by the hiring credit and its longer term effects. Indeed, jobs created thanks to a wage subsidy may no longer be profitable once the credit is over and might be eliminated. Also, jobs are not really created by a displacement effect as much as their timing is modified: in the long term, the total number of months worked in addition thanks to the hiring credit in this case should be 0. However, jobs created thanks to an adjustment subsidy are in theory sustainable beyond the duration of the credit because their variable costs are not in question. To sum up, in the short term, all of these scenarios lead to the same outcome: an increase of employment in eligible firms. But they will have different outcomes once the credit is over: stability of employment growth in the case of the hiring subsidy hypothesis and negative employment growth in the two others.====This research builds on two previous studies that looked at the impact of the 2009 hiring credit on employment and worker flows, Cahuc et al. (2019) and Ananian and Pons (2017). They used different data and evaluation strategies and reached divergent conclusions. Cahuc et al. (2019) find a positive effect of the 2009 hiring credit on employment while Ananian and Pons (2017) find no effect on hiring and separation flows. Both, however, are unable to explain why employment in eligible firms could increase or remain high after 2009 since they only consider the hiring credit’s static effect in 2009, rather than its dynamics from 2009 to 2012, i.e. whether eligible firms in 2008 continue to benefit from it in 2012. The channel of job creation can only be determined by looking at what happens after 2009, and in particular whether jobs created in eligible firms are sustainable. For this purpose, I use an exhaustive administrative database linking employer and employees (the ==== or DADS) to measure the evolution of full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in eligible and ineligible firms to the credit from 2007 to 2012. By calculating the average difference between eligible and ineligible firms month by month while adjusting for their baseline differences, I can assess the effect of eligibility on employment growth before and after the implementation of the hiring credit. That is, I implement a dynamic difference-in-difference approach. I also use an administrative survey (the “Enquête sur les Mouvements de Main d’Oeuvre d’Oeuvre” or EMMO) to measure the effects of the credit on worker flows. My estimation approach is close to Cahuc et al. (2019) but compared to them, in addition to look at worker flows, eligibility is fixed over time which allows to look at the longer term effect of the hiring credit and not just its effect in 2009.====The hiring credit had a positive effect on employment in eligible firms. First, from January 2009 to July 2010, employment growth was consistently higher in eligible firms compared to similar ineligible firms controlling for initial differences. This is mainly explained by a surplus of hires. Second, the hiring credit had a more than transitory impact on employment in eligible firms: employment growth did not fall below similar ineligible firms following the end of the hiring credit, as one would have expected if jobs created by the credit were destroyed. This means that jobs created thanks to the credit are sustainable. Firms did not integrate the credit as a wage subsidy and there was no displacement effect. On the contrary, the credit led firms to create new positions even though their profitability was uncertain in the context of the 2009 recession. In the end, I estimate that the public cost per month of work was low: less than 19% of its private cost; and that it came at no cost for ineligible workers in eligible firms.====I contribute to the literature on employer subsidies as a means of promoting employment by examining the medium-term impact of hiring subsidies in the context of the French recession of 2009, and demonstrating that hiring subsidies achieve this goal, but for different reasons than traditional wage subsidies. In his review of the literature, Katz (1996) argues that existing evidences broadly support wage subsidies as an efficient tool to raise the demand for labor, especially for disadvantaged groups. But he also models hiring subsidies akin to wage subsidies while there may be several important differences. More recent articles have focused specifically on hiring subsidies and highlight their ambiguous effect on employment. Chirinko and Wilson (2016) find that state hiring credits in the US increase employment but also that eligible firms change the timing of hires, which may lead to an overestimation of their impact on employment. Neumark and Grijalva (2017), which are reviewing the effect of state hiring credits in the US too, find that hiring subsidies increase churning more than net employment but seem to be more efficient during recessions. Saez et al. (2021) show that a temporary employment subsidy in Sweden had long term effect even after its repeal. My results are also in line with the literature on dynamic labor demand, according to which employment reacts quickly to shocks on labor costs, with a delay that is clearly infra-annual (Hamermesh, 1988).====This article is divided into several parts. In Section 2, I describe two type of models that can help to illustrate the effect of a hiring credit on labor flows and employment. In Section 3, I present the 2009 French hiring credit and the context of its implementation. In Section 4, I introduce the different sources I use. In Section 5, I highlight several important descriptive statistics. In Section 6, I describe the methodology I use and its results. Finally, in Section 7, I show several robustness checks and in Section 8, I conclude.",The longer term impact of hiring credits.

Our results caution against considering changes in SPA in isolation from personal and family circumstances, given that these affect outcomes significantly.","Between 2010 and 2020, women born in the UK in the 1950s have been affected by several reforms of the state pension age (SPA), resulting in increases of up to six years. Partly because of lack of effective communication, a large proportion of these women were not aware of the changes, thus leading to public discontent, campaigning and several parliamentary discussions (Thurley and McInnes, 2020)====The overall effects of pension reforms are complex but are often analysed only partially. In their report to the European Commission, Bettio et al. (2013) remarked that gender imbalance in pensions is affected by three separate sets of factors. The first is ageing: women have higher life expectancy than men and their past employment patterns typically differ substantially to those of men both in participation and remuneration (Costa Dias et al., 2016); in addition, the effect of family arrangements are also asymmetrically distributed as evidence on the child wage penalty indicates (Kleven et al., 2019). The second factor is past pension reforms and particularly the asymmetric effects occurring from the privatisation of risk that has accompanied the shift from entitlement-based to benefit-based pensions. The third factor is the effect of short-term pressures connected to the different responses of women and men to labour market changes and economic crisis. In addition to reduced working lives due to caring responsibilities, pay and career gaps, women also make up the majority of those giving and receiving late life care (McKenna, 2017). The pension gap can thus be seen as the cumulative outcome of gender inequalities accumulated over the life course that determine women's lower pensions entitlements (Arcanjo, 2019; Burkevica et al., 2015; Tinios et al., 2015).====Using changes in the UK SPA as a natural experiment, in this paper we concentrate on the effects that waiting longer than anticipated to reach SPA has on labour market participation, mental health and life satisfaction of women affected by the reform. To our knowledge, the effect on mental health and life satisfaction has not been analysed before. In addition, we investigate time use changes, income and financial wellbeing as possible mechanisms that affect wellbeing. Not only we analyse the effect on women, but also investigate spill-over effects on their partners which to our knowledge have rarely been considered in the large literature on gender impacts of pension reforms. Finally, we also provide novel evidence on the heterogeneity of the effects by showing that changes in the SPA have larger negative effects on women who already are more vulnerable to low income and poverty.====Ours is the first comprehensive analysis of the direct and indirect effects that the changes in the SPA in the UK had on cohorts of women born in the 1950s. Cribb et al. (2016) and Cribb and Emmerson (2019) have analysed the impact of the change in the SPA on employment, income, poverty and deprivation using either cross-section or a very short panel of 5 quarters, focussing only on the first part of the reform By analysing the impact of the full reform that ended up equalising the SPA between men and women and by using an eight-year long panel data we control better for various confounding factors and are able to identify heterogeneous effects across groups of women by level of education, partnership status and phase of the reform. With the additional investigation of spill-over effects on partners, we provide important information for the design of future reforms wishing to redress gender inequality in later life.",Stung by pension reforms: The unequal impact of changes in state pension age on UK women and their partners,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000841,18 August 2021,2021,Research Article,179.0

Few studies on lower-income countries, in which low household ","An extensive and longstanding literature on the effects of children on household behavior emphasizes their costs in terms of maternal time inputs. Empirical research from high-income countries fuels this by exclusively finding a negative causal relationship between family size and maternal labor supply.==== Hence, economists often hypothesize that having more children, especially young ones, clearly decreases the time mothers spend in the labor market. However, from a theoretical point of view, the sign of the relationship between family size and maternal labor supply is ambiguous. Under reasonable assumptions, a woman is predicted to decrease her leisure time after increasing her fertility. However, some women will increase labor supply and focus on monetary investments while others will reduce labor supply and focus on time investments in order to increase child quality. Besides the monetary inputs in child quality, there are recurring costs of children that do not vary with the mother's hours of work. These fixed costs decrease available income for other consumption, which makes increases in labor supply more valuable by increasing the marginal utility of income.====This paper provides new insights about the effect of fertility on maternal labor supply in a setting with a low level of average household wealth, informal child care provision within extended households, and a high prevalence of informal work. These are all conditions that are typically more prevalent in middle- and low-income countries than in high-income countries; all playing a potentially interesting role in the relationship between fertility and maternal employment. First, low income implies that households already have a high marginal utility of income. Budgetary consequences of children might be more severe in these households and they can have a larger impact on the mother’s propensity to take up employment in order to provide for additional resources. Second, if there are other household members who provide some child care, this will lower the return to maternal time relative to monetary investments into the children. Hence, they increase the incentives to augment labor supply and focus on monetary inputs. Third, the informal labor market might provide preferable employment opportunities to mothers: informal employment might be easier to arrange with child care schedules, which are often half-day, it might provide the possibility to take care of the children while working, and fixed costs of work might be lower in informal than in formal employment.====In order to establish a causal link between the two variables, an instrumental variable approach exploiting parental preferences for mixed-sex siblings, as outlined in Angrist and Evans (1998), is used. My empirical analysis uses data on a sample of about 500,000 Mexican women. The setting provides two attractive features. First, Mexican census data from 2010 allows for observing detailed labor market outcomes in both the informal and formal sectors as well as for identifying the complex household constellations for a large sample of mothers. Second, Mexican parents show a preference for a mixed-sex sibling composition of their children while at the same time there are no strong preferences and discriminatory practices toward one sex.====My results confirm the presence of mixed-sex sibling preferences: Families with two children of the same sex are more likely to have another child compared to those with children of different sexes. Taking into account the potential endogeneity of fertility with the proposed instrumental strategy, I can reject negative effects on employment at the 10 percent significance level and rule out moderate employment decreases due to an increase in family size at the 5 percent significance level, such as decreases of more than 2.1 percentage points. Employment in the informal sector increases by 4.3 percentage points when fertility increases beyond two children. This effect is statistically significant at the 10 percent level and corresponds to a 17 percent increase relative to the average employment level in the sample. With 95 percent confidence, I can rule out decreases in informal employment of more than 0.8 percentage points. There is no effect on employment in the formal sector. This is in line with suggestive evidence that informal jobs provide greater flexibility to care for children compared to formal jobs for women in my sample. I further show that having more than two children increases the probability of living with the maternal grandmother who might provide childcare. Moreover, I find suggestive evidence that the positive employment effect is mainly driven by women who live in households with relatively low household wealth, which have a particularly high utility value for labor income as family size increases. Fathers do not change their employment status or working hours in response to an increase in family size. One potential explanation for the differential effect of family size on mothers and fathers is that the labor market environment was more favorable for women around the time of the Great Recession and, hence, women were increasingly responsible for the provision of financial resources to the family.====In contrast with findings for other settings, in particular with those for high-income countries, I do not find evidence for negative employment effects of an increase in family size. This raises a number of questions: Can potential violations of the identification assumptions challenge the findings? Are there heterogeneous effects across the working hours distribution for the group of compliers? And what can be learned from the estimated effects that pertain to the group of compliers, i.e., mothers who had more children than they otherwise would have due to the sex composition of their first two children? I provide several pieces of evidence in order to shed light on these questions.====First, I carefully assess the concerns that are discussed with respect to the internal validity of the instrument (for example, Wolpin and Rosenzweig, 2000 and Lee (2008)) using several additional data sources. None point to a violation of the identification assumptions. In addition, I take advantage of a formal test procedure for the validity of the identification assumptions proposed by Huber and Mellace (2015). Applying this test, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that the identification assumptions are valid. Second, I estimate local quantile treatment effects which correspond to the effects of having more than two children on the maternal working hours distribution of the complier subpopulation. My findings suggest that fertility increases maternal labor supply in the formal sector at the intensive margin by shifting a few quantiles from around 20 to 40 hours, while mainly having an impact at the extensive margin in the informal sector. Third, I assess the question of generalizability beyond the group of mothers who comply with the instrument. The proportion of compliers is estimated to be around three to four percent and compliers are, on average, different from other population groups both in terms of their observable characteristics and potential labor market outcomes. This challenges the one-to-one transferability of this local effect to a broad group of women. However, by imposing further assumptions, I can bound the effect of having more than two children on the propensity to be informally employed to be non-negative for all mothers in the sample based on approaches by Brinch, Mogstad, and Wiswall (2017) and Kowalski (2021a).====My paper is primarily related to the large literature on the relationship between fertility and female labor supply. As illustrated in Online Appendix Table A1, there are numerous studies on high-income countries that unambiguously find a negative effect of an exogenous increase in family size on maternal labor supply at the extensive margin.==== In contrast, Online Appendix Table A2 indicates that the few studies examining this relationship in middle- and low-income countries find mixed results.==== Agüero, Marks, 2008, Agüero, Marks, 2011 find close to zero and insignificant effects of different fertility measures on the decision to work in a pooled sample of middle- and low-income countries. Cáceres-Delpiano (2012) finds a significant negative effect on the probability of working when increasing fertility beyond one child, but no significant effect when moving beyond two. Cruces and Galiani (2007) and Heath (2017) find significant negative effects of having more than two children and of the number of children, respectively, on the probability to work. I contribute to this literature by providing evidence that mothers do not necessarily decrease their employment when having a larger family and by identifying multiple mechanisms that can explain the difference in the results between high- and lower-income countries, for example, low wealth and informal care provision by other family members.====In addition to the effect on maternal employment, there are other dimensions of maternal labor supply that are important to consider. First, I go beyond the effect at the extensive margin of maternal labor supply and investigate how the working hours distribution of compliers changes with children. Among the studies of middle- and low-income countries in Online Appendix Table A2, only Heath (2017) investigates the intensive margin of labor supply and finds a positive effect of having children on self-employment conditional on employment.==== Second, I illustrate that informal compared to formal labor arrangements appear to provide more job flexibility at the cost of lower wages. Distinguishing between the two, I show that women increase employment in informal jobs when having more children.====Most of the studies listed in Online Appendix Tables A1 and A2 rely on an IV strategy that is applied in a specific context. Still, the local nature of the estimated local average treatment effects is rarely discussed, despite its importance for interpretation and the derived policy implications. One exception is Bisbee, Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii (2017), who apply the samesex-instrument across a large number of countries and time periods and provide an approach to extrapolate the complier-specific local average treatment effect ====. In contrast, my paper zooms in and investigates the potential to extrapolate the local treatment effect for compliers to a broad group of women ====. Hence, the two studies are highly complementary in the discussion about the local nature of average treatment effects that are estimated using the instrument in a specific context.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides background information on households and several aspects of the labor market in Mexico. This information is helpful for putting the results into perspective. In Section 3, I describe the data and the construction of the sample. In particular, I provide details on informal employment in the Mexican setting. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and assesses the underlying identification assumptions. Section 5 presents my findings on the relationship between family size and parental labor market outcomes. In Section 6, I provide some evidence on potential mechanisms behind my findings. The extrapolation of the effects for compliers to non-compliers within the sample is discussed in Section 7.

The salience of gender norms varies across treatments: the ==== group chooses between strategies labelled as a family specialisation game (==== vs. ====), the ==== group chooses ==== vs. ====. Women respond strongly to the salience of ====; they opt for ==== at a significantly lower rate compared to ====, regardless of familiarity with their partner. By contrast, men’s response is weak and heterogeneous across partner and stranger pairings. Additional analyses suggest that the pattern is not explained by differential beliefs, but is consistent with marriage market motives of some men who may want to signal progressive gender attitudes to their partner.","In most industrialised societies, women perform more unpaid work in the home and less paid work in the market than men. Fig. 1 documents this gendered division of labour for OECD countries: on average, men spend a larger fraction of their total daily time working for pay than women, while the reverse is true for unpaid work. Economists have long viewed this pattern as the result of intra-household specialisation according to comparative advantage (Becker, 1973, Gronau, 1973, Gronau, 1973), assuming that women are, on average, relatively less productive in the labour market than men.==== More recent work, however, suggests that gender gaps in the labour market arise only ==== couples begin to divide labour along gender lines, assigning primary responsibility for unpaid child-rearing activities to women (Blau, Kahn, 2017, Goldin, 2014, Goldin, Kerr, Olivetti, Barth, 2017, Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2018, Lundberg, Rose, 2000, Lundborg, Plug, Rasmussen, 2017, OECD, 2017). But if gender differences in labour market productivity are more likely a result rather than the initial reason for gendered specialisation in families, what other factors motivate couples to divide labour along gender lines?====The present paper focuses on gender norms and their potential power to reinforce the gendered division of labour. In recent years, gender norms received increasing attention by academics and policy makers concerned over their potentially negative impacts on the economic efficiency of households (Akerlof, Kranton, 2000, Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015, European Commission, 2016, OECD, 2017, OECD, 2017). Using a model of household labour supply, Cudeville and Recoules (2015) show how gender norms and couples’ desire for social conformity can distort male and female labour supplies in couples where women have a comparative advantage for market work. While the theoretical model is intuitive, the impact of norms on household division of labour is notoriously difficult to study empirically. Prior work has documented behaviours that are consistent with the notion that social gender norms regulate women’s relative involvement in market work (Akerlof, Kranton, 2000, Alesina, Giuliano, Nunn, 2013, Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015, Fernandez, Fogli, 2009, Fernández, Fogli, Olivetti, 2004, Fortin, 2005, Fortin, 2015), but much of the evidence is also consistent with alternative channels. For instance, systematic gender differences in productivities or in hedonic returns to engaging in market versus care work would yield similar results and are likely not orthogonal to gender norms (see Görges and Nosenzo, 2020, for a detailed discussion).====In this paper, I take advantage of a controlled lab experiment to study the causal impact of gender norms on couples’ specialisation choices. By varying the salience of gender norms exogenously and ruling out gender differences in productivity and preferences by design, this paper provides evidence that norms exert a ==== effect on division of labour choices, independent of other motives that may factor into that decision outside the lab. 192 subjects, real heterosexual couples, play a symmetric ====-style coordination game, in which each partner can choose one of two available actions. Across treatments, I vary whether the labeling of the actions is neutral (==== vs. ====) or makes gender norms salient (==== vs. ====). Coordination occurs when each of the two available actions are simultaneously chosen by one of the partners (i.e., each partner ‘specialises’ in one of two actions), but payoffs are asymmetric and favour the player who chose ====/====. Each subject plays with their real partner and a randomly matched stranger of the same sex as their partner.====The main result of the experiment is that women’s specialisation choices are highly sensitive to the salience of gender norms. Compared to the ==== group, women opt for ==== at a significantly lower rate in the ==== group. The reduction is large, women in ==== choose ==== more than twice as often compared to women in ====. Notably, the drop occurs both when women are paired with their partners and strangers. This shows that gender norms directly affect women’s behaviour and, by extension, lower their claims to a joint pie, even when they receive no other forms of compensation and intra-couple redistribution is ruled out (as is the case with strangers).====A second result is that men’s response to the salience of norms is much weaker than that of women and sensitive to whether men are paired with a stranger or their real partner. When paired with their real partner, men in the ==== group are in fact no more likely to opt for ==== than men in ====; a quantitatively large, yet statistically not significant increase of around 20 percentage points is only observed in stranger pairings. Exploring potential mechanisms for this heterogeneity, I find suggestive evidence that this discrepancy might be a result of men’s marriage market signalling, in the spirit of Bursztyn et al. (2017). Specifically, I document patterns consistent with the interpretation that some men care to signal progressive gender attitudes to their potential long-term partners—“acting feminist”—but not to an anonymous, randomly matched woman. An alternative explanation, differential beliefs regarding partners’ and strangers’ ==== choices, is not borne out by the data.====Apart from its contribution to the growing economics literature on gender norms, the paper’s perspective on norms as a coordination device relates it to a small number of experimental studies on the effectiveness of focal points (Crawford, Gneezy, Rottenstreich, 2008, Isoni, Poulsen, Sugden, Tsutsui, 2013, Isoni, Poulsen, Sugden, Tsutsui, 2014). In a study most closely related to this paper, Holm (2000) shows that gender in itself can provide a focal point in a symmetric coordination game where the two pure strategy Nash equilibria result in unequal payoffs. He presents evidence that mixed-sex pairs of players are indeed more likely to coordinate than same-sex pairs and that the equilibrium that favours the male player is focal. Surprisingly, despite recurring interest in the question of whether gender norms provide a focal point in the household division of labour problem in the theoretical literature (Baker, Jacobsen, 2007, Engineer, Welling, 1999, Hadfield, 1999), it has not been studied empirically. The present paper addresses this gap by studying a classic ==== game played by ==== heterosexual couples and mixed-sex pairs of strangers, thus offering insights into whether societal gender norms, or couple-specific norms, can improve coordination outcomes.====The paper also contributes to a growing literature on economic experiments with real couples (for an overview, see Hopfensitz, Munro, 2020, Munro, 2018). Most closely related to this study are the experiments by Görges (2015) and Cochard et al. (2018), who study division of labour. Görges (2015) finds that women are more likely to perform an unpaid real effort task to reach efficiency gains when paired with their partner compared to women paired with a male stranger. Cochard et al. (2018) present couples with an abstract public good game and show that women are no more likely than men to shift money or time from their private into the public account. This result is somewhat surprising given that, outside the lab, women are frequently observed to spend more time than men providing the family public good.==== Both Görges (2015) and Cochard et al. (2018) conjecture that their findings may be related to the salience of gender norms, which is low in the lab setting in Cochard et al. (2018), and lower for individuals playing with strangers compared to real partners in Görges (2015). The present paper corroborates this interpretation by providing first empirical evidence that women tend to claim a smaller share of a joint pie when gender norms are salient.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 lays out the experimental game, while details on the procedure are provided in Section 3.

Using a difference-in-differences approach and a unique 12-year panel of personnel records from a large French company, we find that the arrival of a child creates a persistent penalty in earnings for mothers. The gap in internal ====, both at the extensive and intensive margin, accounts for the vast majority of the motherhood penalty within the firm. We believe that firm-level policies on child-related leaves, if not gender-neutral, can exacerbate the motherhood penalty.","How does the birth of the first child affect a woman’s earnings, as compared to her childless female co-workers? What is the main source of the wage penalty to mothers in the workplace? Is there an association between firms’ child-related leave policies and the motherhood penalty? To answer these questions, this paper exploits a rich 12-year panel of confidential administrative data from a large manufacturing company in France to investigate the parenthood pay gap within the firm.====Despite having made significant progress in the labour market, women continue to earn considerably less than men, remain highly underrepresented in the upper part of the earnings distribution and their career develop at a slower pace (Blau and Winkler (2017); Bertrand (2018)). One of the most prominent factors preventing women back is that they continue to bear the brunt of the labour-market costs of non-market work, in particular childcare (Waldfogel (1997); Budig and England (2001); Lundberg and Rose (2000); Miller (2011); Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017); Lundborg et al. (2017)). A large literature showed that most of the career costs of children are due to intermittency or reduced labour supply, i.e. part-time switches, lower investments in skills and human capital depreciation (Angrist and Evans (1998); Altonji and Blank (1999); Albrecht et al. (1999); Bertrand et al. (2010); Adda et al. (2017)). Other works have investigated the role of productivity differences related to workforce commitment and social norms (Azmat and Ferrer (2017); Bertrand et al. (2015)), sorting of workers into different industries, occupations and firms (Bayard et al., 2003), differences in bargaining ability (Card et al., 2016), and the long-term effects of childcare duties on mothers’ earnings and career opportunities (Angelov et al. (2016); Lundborg et al. (2017); Kleven et al. (2019b); Kleven et al. (2019a)).====A recent stream of research has explored gender differences in careers within firms (Bronson and Thoursie (2020); Hotz et al. (2018)). In line with this literature, this paper uses personnel data from a French firm from 2005 to 2016 to provide evidence that the promotion gap between mothers and their childless female co-workers is the main driver of the motherhood penalty in the workplace. An important limitation of previous works stands in the inability to precisely measure promotions. Focusing on one firm allows us to create reliable criteria to identify vertical moves within the internal hierarchy. Our main contribution stands in the provision of a detailed empirical characterization of the difference between parents’ and non-parents’ career patterns within the firm by clearly identifying both job transitions in the internal career ladder and the change in earnings attached to such transitions.====On the one hand, the clear identification of promotions within the firm is our comparative advantage for studying the main mechanism through which the child penalty operates in the workplace. On the other hand, we acknowledge that we are estimating local effects and that our findings are suggestive as far as other similar firms are considered. Our company is very large – it accounted for 61,000 employees in 2016 – has establishments all over the French territory and, as we show, its employees do not differ from the average French population. It is also a very attractive firm, which pays higher wages than the average of its sector and, on top of remuneration, provides different welfare-entitlements. In this sense, we believe that a firm perspective can offer an interesting insight on the practices that companies can adopt to mitigate the motherhood penalty. Indeed, very recent works have suggested that public policies, in particular parental leave and child care subsidies, have actually played a limited role in improving mothers’ labour market outcomes (Kleven et al., 2021). Given these findings, new studies are focusing on the role played by individual firms in the provision of extended parental leave and paid family leave (Goldin et al., 2020). We believe that if such practices are not gender-neutral, they can negatively affect mothers’ career advancements.====To analyze the motherhood penalty in the workplace we develop a difference-in-differences analysis in which we estimate changes in labour market outcomes for employees who experience the birth of the first child as compared to a group of childless co-workers. While trends are similar prior to childbirth, after the transition into motherhood, women’s earnings fall with no evidence of catching-up. Eight years after the birth of the first child, mothers are still earning around ==== less than non-mothers. The main source of the motherhood penalty is the gap in promotions. In the year of and in the year immediately following childbirth, mothers’ career advancements drop. Only two years after birth, they start again to make some upward moves within the firm’s hierarchy. However, the wage gains attached to such moves are much lower than those of non-mothers. Mothers end-up in a slower and less steep career path, a “mommy track”, that leads them behind non-mothers in the job ladder and largely decreases their probability to be promoted in a managerial position. The promotion gap also contributes to explain the widening in the performance-related pay, i.e. the pay component related to individual productivity, which share on overall earnings tends to increase with job title. Despite not having a direct measure of workers’ productivity, all our estimates include individual fixed effects that allow us to hold constant individual intrinsic productivity. We further investigate the possible role of discrimination and find that the difference in career patterns between mothers and non-mothers is highest in early career, then decreases with tenure. This finding is consistent with statistical discrimination (Altonji and Pierret, 2001).====Evidence on the motherhood penalty is common to many countries, despite the wide range of policies and norms (Kleven et al., 2019a). Most of our knowledge comes from the experience of Northern European countries, characterized by both high female employment rates and generous public family policies. Kleven et al. (2019b), using administrative data for Denmark and an event study methodology, show that the long-run child penalty in earnings is about 20 percent and that this can explain up to ==== of the residual gender pay gap in the country. Angelov et al. (2016) compare the income and wage trajectories of women to those of their male partners before and after parenthood in Sweden. They find that 15 years after the first child was born, the male-female gender gap in income increased by 32 percentage points. Studies on the French population are much more scarce, a gap that we contribute to fill. Wilner (2016) uses matched employer-employee data and estimates a motherhood penalty in hourly wage of around ==== for the first child, smaller than our findings of ==== However, due to the sample specific population considered – the sample selected only covers individuals who entered the labour market after 1995, who are on average 26.9 years old – these results are not readily comparable with ours.====A more recent literature has moved the analysis of the motherhood penalty to the workplace. This is the stream of research we primarily speak to. In particular, our paper is closely related to the work of Bronson and Thoursie (2020). Studying college-educated Swedish employees from 1985 to 2013 and defining promotions as an employee’s large wage increase relative to his/her co-workers, they find that women’s probability of promotions drops around the timing of childbirth and that this drop accounts for about ==== of the gender difference in cumulative promotions by age 45 for individuals who ever have children. However, as Baker and Holmstrom (1995) note, defining promotions as movements from a lower average pay to a higher average pay can be problematic for analyzing the relationship between wages and promotions. Focusing on a single firm further allows us to give a more precise measure of promotions. We characterize both job transitions in the internal career ladder and the change in earnings attached to such transitions. We also explore the motherhood gap in promotions both at the extensive, i.e. the probability of being promoted, and at the intensive margin, i.e. the number of career advancements within the job ladder, conditional on being promoted.====Another stream of this literature has focused on the role of workplace characteristics in explaining the divergence in careers of women and men (Nielsen et al. (2004); Felfe (2012); Beblo et al. (2008); Goldin (2014); Cortés and Pan (2019)). Note that since we focus on a single company, our results are not contaminated by different human resource practices across firms, nor by the sorting effect of mothers and non-mothers across firms with different job amenities and pay==== Hotz et al. (2018) find that women’s job mobility, relative to that of men, increases with the onset of parenthood. They also find that the income penalty to motherhood declines with improvements with the family friendliness of workplaces, in particular facilitating mothers in working more hours. In this sense, we are able to further suggest how specific firms’ practices related to extended parental leave and paid family leave can influence the motherhood penalty. In particular, we believe that the non-gender-neutrality of some our company’s internal policies, such as guaranteeing extra-weeks of leave or paid child-related leave to mothers only, despite non directly affecting their earnings, influence their managers’ assessment in terms of chances of career advancement. Our findings are consistent with Thomas (2020), who shows that, in a world where statistical discrimination exists, extended maternal leave policies exacerbate and widen the motherhood gap in promotions.====Evidence on the effects of fatherhood on earnings are more scarce and controversial. The predominant idea is that men gain from fatherhood. According to Millimet (2000), firms are willing to increase fathers’ wages since they assume that men with children are more reliable and less likely to relocate. Fathers are seen as more committed to paid work and advantaged over childless men in several ways, for example being offered higher starting salaries (Correll et al., 2007). Simonsen and Skipper (2008) estimated a ==== gain in earnings for fathers in Denmark. Other findings question this view. Cools and Strøm (2016), on a panel of employees over the years ====, found a small wage penalty for men with children in Norway. This penalty was larger for fathers who work full time in the private sector and mostly explained by paternity leave. Instead, Wilner (2016) found that men in France do not receive any premium nor suffer any penalty from fatherhood. These results are in line with our findings: we find no effects of parenthood for male employees.====The structure of the paper is as follows. We describe the institutional context and the dataset in Section 2. In Section 3 we present our empirical strategy. Section 4 shows the main results and explains the underlying mechanisms of the child penalty for mothers. In Section 5 we propose a decomposition of this penalty, while in Section 6 we perform different robustness checks. Section 7 concludes.",The “mommy track” in the workplace.

It uses a data case, whereby a worker could decide to work in a richer economy and place himself there by a daily or weekly commute. This set-up faciliates the disentanglement of income differences motives from a plethora of other motives. Thus it eschews the bias inherent in many studies.====The paper emphasizes the idea that tasks are tied to locations, and workers choose a location-task-wage ‘pack.’ The task demanded, which is a bundle of skills, constrains human capital returns for movers. Relatively low task returns generate a substantial offset to the productivity gain for migrants, stemming from the rich economy having higher TFP and capital.","The phenomenon of workers moving from a poor to a rich economy is a very prevalent one. It may be an internal migration or commuting move or migration across countries.==== It is a salient issue, with such migration flows very high on the political agenda in many rich countries. When a worker moves to an economy richer than the home economy, what are the outcomes of the move? There is a view whereby the migrant gains from this move are very large. For example, Kennan (2013) estimates a gain in net income of 125% in a model of migrants from poor countries to rich ones. This view is reinforced by findings in the literature, whereby there are large GDP per capita and wage cross-country differences; see, for example, the review in Jones (2016).====It is not straightforward, however, to answer the question of the gains and costs of the move to a rich country. The difficulty is related to the need to disentangle the effects of income differences on movers decisions from many other determinants of such mobility. The set of determinants includes geographical distance, socio-demographic factors, including family linkages and social networks, credit constraints, welfare benefits, insurance motives, psychological issues, and more. Many estimates in the literature are potentially biased due to substantial mis-specification of the model, when omitting relevant determinants, often because data are unavailable. This paper studies a case that allows to isolate the pure effects of cross-country income differences. The data set consists of repeated cross-sections of a Labor Force Survey of Palestinian workers who were working in Israel and in the local economy. The survey sampled both movers and stayers within a unified setting.==== During most of the 1980s a sizeable fraction of the male labor force from these areas worked in Israel, a far richer economy.==== The features of this labor market were such that the other cited determinants of mobility played no role. There existed a situation, whereby a worker could decide to work in a richer economy and place himself there by a daily or weekly commute. Without the confounding factors, the decision to work in the rich economy can be estimated without bias. The data used here engender the following set-up: capital and productivity differences were sufficiently high so as to conform oft-documented rich-poor countries differences, typically not found within a single country. At the same time, the relatively short distances facilitated a low-cost move from the poor to the rich economy.====A key rationale underlying the analysis is the distinction between factors external to the worker, such as technology, capital, and institutions, and factors embodied in the worker, such as skills and abilities. Hence, when estimating wage equations so as to infer the gains of the move from a poor to a rich economy, it explicitly address the question of what workers experience in the richer economy (say, higher TFP), what is taken from the poor economy (human capital), and their choices in moving (self-selection).====Importantly, it takes into account the fact that movers and stayers are typically constrained in terms of the job tasks offered and the skills required for them. The paper recognizes that workers face job tasks requirements and particular rewards for their skills in performing these tasks. It connects with Autor and Handel (2013), who estimate a similar self-selection model with U.S. job and wage data, and note the issue of skill bundling within tasks. The bundling in the current paper is in terms of location, tasks, and skills. Workers are demanded for a particular task, utilizing a bundle of skills, rewarded in a specific way, in each location.====The task perspective is relevant for many cases of foreign minorities in advanced economies. Often, workers belonging to such minorities are demanded to perform low-skill tasks. In a review of migration, productivity, and the labor market, Peri (2016) emphasizes, the importance of recognizing the role of tasks performed by migrants, especially manual tasks. He references studies documenting this widespread phenomenon, showing that employment in manual, low-skill occupations is a salient feature.====I use a self-selection model employing two alternative estimation methodologies to examine wage regressions of movers and stayers. I analyze the findings across the two economies both in terms of the mean wage differential and in terms of the distributions involved. My findings offer a new take on the outcomes, as the pure effects of income differences in the choice to move to a rich economy are made up of diverse elements, operating in opposition. Productivity differences in favor of the richer economy, due to differences in TFP and in the stock and quality of physical capital, are sizeable and operate to raise wages. However, lower returns to human capital and lower stocks of human capital for movers, operate to lower wages. The latter is due to negative selection on observables by movers, who are offered low-skill tasks in the rich economy. The latter effect offsets to large extent the former gain, sometimes overturning it. Self-selection on unobservables, however is positive, consistently with the nature of the tasks in question.====These findings reveal large ==== differences and small ==== migrant gains, due to the afore-mentioned offset. The findings also imply that the self-selection of movers in terms of skills is not the unique major determinant here, and that the productivity differences involved need to be recognized as playing a big role. Knowing the patterns of self-selection does not suffice to understand the poor to rich economy move.====The contribution of this paper may be better understood when noting that the literature often looks at the move from poor to rich economies (i) without disentangling the income differences motive from the other motives, and (ii) anticipating a big productivity gain due to the rich economy having higher TFP and capital. This paper shows that with respect to point (i), there is normally the potential for substantial misspecification and bias, while the unique data set used here eschews such bias. With respect to point (ii), the paper emphasizes the idea that tasks are tied to locations, and so workers choose a location-task-wage ‘pack’ that determines rewards to the skills bundled in the task. The low rewards for tasks offered to movers generate a substantial offset to the productivity gain.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers the background and context in the literature. Section 3 presents the model. It elaborates on the role of skills and tasks in the model and highlights the distinction between factors external to the worker and those embodied in the worker. Section 4 presents the Palestinian labor market and its key features, justifying the use of various elements in the model, and discusses the data set (with further elaboration in online Appendix A).

I show why the exporters are generally more productive and skill intensive and how trade cost reductions induce more productive firms to choose a higher degree of labor specialization, become more skill intensive and start to export. I further demonstrate how such internal horizontal organizational changes, after a trade cost reduction, can directly increase aggregate skill intensity and the relative demand for skilled workers, resulting in higher skill premium in a general equilibrium setting. Lastly, I calibrate this model to the Mexican data to quantify the rise in the skill premium in the period of its trade liberalization 1985~1993.","In the last two decades of the 20th century, many countries implemented trade liberalization policies which opened them up to the international markets. Conventional theories such as Stopler-Samuelson’s theorem have stressed that free trade would lead to a greater degree of equality in a developing country. However, as evidence shows and reviewed in Online Appendix F, the skill premium, defined as the relative wage of the high-skilled and low-skilled workers has risen in the past decades following the trade liberalizations in those countries which implemented such policies.====In this paper, by extending the labor specialization model in Madanizadeh (2017) and Chaney and Ossa (2013), I develop and quantify a micro-founded model of international trade with endogenous skill intensities at the firm level to complement the researches explaining such a phenomenon. I show how opening to trade can raise skill premium in an economy through endogenous decisions on the specialization at the firm level, and within-industry reallocations of labor. In this new framework, consistent with the empirical findings,==== I show how international trade induces firms to increase the level of worker specialization==== and become more skill-intensive; and how it increases the relative labor demand of high-skilled workers vs. low-skilled ones, since there is more gain in specializing the high-skilled workers. Taking the supply of workers fixed, the relative wage of high vs low-skilled workers may increase as the relative demand has increased.====In this framework, a firm decides about the structure of its division of labor. Basically, the firm chooses how many divisions of specialization it needs, how many tasks a worker should perform in a division, and how it can coordinate different divisions to produce the output. In particular, a firm pays some “Fixed Specialization Costs (FSC)”,==== designs its organization and assigns its workers to different imperfect substitute groups, performing different tasks. Having more groups means higher division of labor and specialization, thus higher gains.====The firm faces a trade-off: implementing more groups gives a productivity gain to the firm at the cost of paying the FSC. This trade-off generates an economy of scale based on the firm’s desire to meet its production demand. Higher demand provides more incentive to the firm to pay FSC and increase its division of labor. Consequently, an increase in the production demand or in the firm’s productivity would induce the firm to increase the number of its specialized groups, resulting in an increase in its labor productivity.====Also the less substitute the groups are, the higher gain the firm enjoys from this specialization. Here, I assume the skilled workers are generally less substitutable with each other giving an advantage towards their specialization.==== This means that the difference between high and low-skilled workers is that the skilled workers’ gain from specialization is more than low-skilled ones’. Therefore, a firm benefits more from specializing the high-skilled workers. This gap in productivity gain generates a shift toward the specialization of high-skilled workers. Thus, an increase in a firm’s production demand or an increase in its productivity leads to the firm’s decision to specialize its skilled workers more. This biased expansion consequently increases a firm’s relative labor demand (the ratio of the demand for high-skilled vs low-skilled workers).====International trade, through a reduction in trade costs, introduces a rise in demand. This new demand induces the more productive firms to export; thus, old and new exporters restructure to not only become more specialized but also more skill-intensive.==== With a reduction in trade costs, a larger number of productive firms and exporters endogenously decide to become more skill-intensive, and demand a larger number of high-skilled workers relative to low-skilled ones. This horizontal organizational expansion, especially in the new exporters, increases the proportion of more skill-intensive firms in the industry. Such organizational changes in the above-mentioned firms result in a reallocation of high-skilled workers within the industry toward the exporters. I show how these changes can result in a rise in the aggregate relative demand of high-skilled, relative to low-skilled labor, and consequently a rise in their relative wages.====A by-product of the described model is the introduction of a new channel for the gains from international trade.==== As previously described, trade integration increases the exporters’ degree of specialization which raises their overall labor productivity; hence, leading to a rise in the aggregate productivity leading to increases in real wages, which is similar to Chaney and Ossa (2013).====To show the model’s results quantitatively, I calibrate the model to the data from Mexico as a developing country by matching some moments of the model with the Mexican data. I match the fraction of exporters, the export share of sales, skill premium, and the average number of employees per firm from data to the predictions of the model to calibrate the primitive parameters of the model. Then I analyze several counterfactual scenarios to find out how much of the increase in the skill premium in a trade liberalization period can be elucidated by my model. I find that 10% of the rise of the skill premium in Mexico from 1985 to 1993 can be explained by this model through changes in the bilateral iceberg trade costs. I also examine the counterfactual policies of changing fixed exporting cost, foreign aggregate demand, and relative supply of high-skilled labor.====Finally, I analyze some comparative statics of changes in fundamental parameters of the model: gains from specialization and fixed specialization costs. I show that an increase/decrease in the gain from the specialization of high/low-skilled workers or a decrease in the fixed cost of specialization for the high-skilled workers can increase the skill premium; although they have different implications on the extensive and intensive margins of trade.==== In contrast to conventional theories, skill premium rose in the last decades following the worldwide trade liberalizations, even in developing countries. Evidence and the related mechanisms are reviewed in the Online Appendix F. This paper develops a new mechanism complementary to the “skill-biased technology” mechanism for describing the skill premium through the lens of labor division and endogenous firm organization.====First, my model is close to Bustos (2011) which shows that more productive firms and exporters upgrade their skill-biased technologies and become more skill-intensive. In contrast, this paper constructs a micro-founded model for the endogenous skill intensity as an organizational decision of a firm, similar to Caliendo et al. (2015). My model is more particularly focused on within-firm organizational decisions rather than a technology selection.====Second, my work is related to Harrigan and Reshef (2011), Burstein et al. (2013) and Burstein and Vogel (2017) which employ a skill-biased production technology with inherently correlated productivity and skill intensity at the firm level. Therefore, the trade will result in the survival of more productive firms and thus the more skill-intensive ones. Thus, a direct consequence would be higher skill intensity in the industry, resulting in an increase in the skill premium due to the rise in the aggregate demand for skill. But, in my model, all the changes happen endogenously inside the firm due to a rise in the output demand or a rise in an unbiased firm’s productivity. In other words, in contrast to Burstein and Vogel (2017), I make this skill-biased technology to be endogenous and firm-dependent. In my paper, it is the firm that decides about its organization and the level of specialization towards skilled workers and chooses to be biased towards more skilled workers. In Burstein and Vogel (2017), the critical issue of firm’s demand has no role in the organization of the firm and no role in the skill-bias effect.====From the micro-foundation point of view, this paper relates to the original work of Adam Smith (1776). Similarly, it relates to Becker and Murphy (1992) that shows if workers focus on narrower tasks, they get higher returns, and thus a more extensive division of labor increases productivity. Also, this paper is close to Chaney and Ossa (2013) that show how exposition to larger markets and exportation can induce firms to increase the division of labor and become more productive. It is also related to Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Costinot (2009), as they study the patterns of specialization and comparative advantage across tasks.====Moreover, this paper is connected to Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012), Caliendo et al. (2015) where they study the role of organization and the number of layers in a firm and how international trade can affect it. They show that reducing trade costs and the increase in demand will induce firms, especially the exporters, to increase the number of organizational layers and expand. In my paper, I focus on the distributional effects of trade on firms’ horizontal organization and labor division. Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg’s model focuses on the vertical organization of a firm whereas my model is discussing a horizontal expansion of a firm. In other words, two firms can have different divisions of labor in a layer but have the same number of layers. Also, in this paper, the wage differences are coming from differences of high-skilled versus low-skilled substitutability which is a result of the gain from specialization.====On the empirical side, the literature is very narrow. Coviello et al. (2019) use micro data of judges in Italy and show that the productivity of judges increases as they specialize and focus on cases of a certain type. Garicano and Hubbard (2009) show that in US law firms, specialization increases as market size extends. Tian (2019) uses Brazilian firm-level data and shows that firms’ division of labor and thus their productivity increases with city size which is a proxy for the market size; this effect is larger for more export-oriented industries. They also show that larger cities reduce the costs associated with larger labor divisions and thus it increases the specializations in firms. Also, Duranton and Jayet (2011) use data from French cities and show that the level of specialization increases in larger cities.

Our analysis uses data from an experiment, which randomly assigned low-income individuals to perform a cognitive test before or after payday. On average, and based on traditional subgroup analysis, the experiment did not suggest that the poorer financial circumstances before payday impeded cognitive function. Using the causal forest method, however, our heterogeneity analysis suggests that there are indeed detrimental effects among young and elderly individuals with very low incomes. We can confirm this finding in an independent experiment, using only traditional subgroup analysis.","Many studies have documented associations between poverty and less beneficial behavior. For example, the poor are less likely than those with higher incomes to make use of preventive health services, and more likely to smoke cigarettes, play the lottery, and borrow more often at high cost.==== Despite long-standing debates in economics and other disciplines, the reasons for such behavior remain unclear and the topic itself controversial. One recent hypothesis has focused on the financial circumstances of the poor and the potentially detrimental impact of these on attentional focus: In a sample of farmers from India, Mani et al. (2013) found that participants showed reduced attentional performance before harvest, when poor, compared to after harvest, when rich. The authors suggested that a preoccupation with monetary concerns may leave the farmers before harvest with fewer mental resources available for other processes.====In the only other study to have investigated this hypothesis empirically to date, Carvalho et al. (2016) assigned a sample of low-income US individuals randomly to perform a number of cognitive tests before or after payday. The individuals surveyed before payday faced poorer financial circumstances than those surveyed after payday. However, the authors found no before-after differences in cognitive function in the full sample or selected subgroups. These mixed empirical findings, and the dearth of studies on this hypothesis in general, highlight the need to identify, at a more detailed level, the groups of individuals in which poor financial circumstances might have detrimental effects on cognitive function.====To contribute to this area of study, we therefore analyze heterogeneity in the effect of financial circumstances on attention, focusing on identifying individuals in whom poorer financial circumstances have negative effects. To do so, we use data from the experiment conducted by Carvalho et al. (2016). For our heterogeneity analysis, we use the causal forest method by Athey et al. (2019), which was developed specifically to explore heterogeneous treatment effects in experiments. The method can be described as an adaptive nearest-neighbors approach that exploits ideas from the random forest machine learning literature to determine the relevant neighborhoods for estimating conditional average treatment effects at given points in the covariate space. Compared with traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) subgroup analyses, the causal forest method allows non-linear treatment effects to be estimated in a fully flexible way and circumvents the need to specify an interacted model, which may not always be straightforward (especially when the number of covariates is large). We examine effect heterogeneity using a rich set of 37 policy-relevant, pre-treatment covariates, including age, income, employment status, and measures of financial strain in the past. Our causal forest analysis proceeds in the following steps: First, we investigate which covariates are particularly relevant for heterogeneity in the treatment effect. Next, we examine how the effect varies across the most important variables. Subsequently, we study, in greater detail, the effect heterogeneity in regions of the covariate space where the previous step indicates particularly detrimental effects.====The results of our analysis suggest that there is strong effect heterogeneity in the two covariates age and income. For old and young individuals who received a very low income around the time of the experiment, we find that the poorer financial circumstances before payday had detrimental cognitive effects. We verify this finding using a second, independent, experiment conducted by Carvalho et al. (2016). Our results provide further evidence that there may be a causal effect of poverty on attention. They also demonstrate the benefit of using the causal forest method to identify treatment effect heterogeneity that may have been overlooked in traditional subgroup analyses.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the experiment and our analysis sample. Section 3 explains the causal forest method.

Xia Xing,"Yale-NUS College. 28 College Avenue West 01–501, 138533 Singapore","Received 16 June 2020, Revised 4 June 2021, Accepted 8 June 2021, Available online 27 June 2021, Version of Record 7 July 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2021.102027,Cited by (3)," suggests that occupational licensing can be a barrier to entry that restricts labor supply (Friedman, 1962; Stigler, 1971) or a signal of quality that enhances the labor market (Leland, 1979). This paper studies two types of licenses for dental assistants (DAs) in the U.S. to illustrate the competing supply-restricting and quality-signaling effects of licensing on minority workers. Specifically, I study the effects of introducing the X-ray permit, a state-issued license to perform X-ray procedures that also carries information about a DA’ s competence, against that of the entry-level license, which provides little information about a DA’ s competence. I find that the X-ray permit requirement reduces the wage gap between non-Hispanic white and minority DAs by 8 percent, presumably because it helps minority DAs secure jobs that entail X-ray procedures. In contrast, entry-level licensing does not reduce the racial wage gap. These findings suggest that licensing alleviates statistical discrimination if it reveals information about the holder’ s productivity.","Economic theory offers two alternative views of occupational licensing with opposing implications for minority workers. The first view sees licensing as a barrier to entry that restricts labor supply and, thereby, reduces employment and raises incumbents’ wages (Friedman, 1962, Stigler, 1971). This supply-restricting effect is likely to be felt if the qualification requirements for licensing are more stringent than the labor market equilibrium qualification level in the absence of licensing. According to this view, licensing diminishes the employment opportunities of minorities if minorities have a harder time fulfilling the qualification requirements (Kleiner, 2000). The alternative view sees licensing as a signal of quality, revealing information that would otherwise be costly for employers and customers to obtain (Akerlof, 1970, Leland, 1979). This quality-assuring effect is likely to arise in the presence of asymmetric information. If the information asymmetry gives rise to statistical discrimination, licensing may then enhance the labor market outcome of minorities (Blair, Chung, 2018, Law, Marks, 2009).====This paper studies two types of licenses for one occupation in the U.S. – dental assistants (DAs) – to provide evidence that the labor market effects of occupational licensing vary, depending on the restrictiveness of the licensing requirements and the extent of pre-existing information asymmetries regarding professionals’ competence.====DAs are now the most numerous members of a dental team, outnumbering dentists by three to one. As a relatively new and fast-growing occupation, their scope of practice has gradually expanded over time. Licensing requirements for DAs depend on their job scope. At the entry level, all states allow DAs to perform entry-level procedures (legally referred to as “basic supportive procedures”); six states and D.C. require an entry-level license for these procedures. Beyond the entry-level procedures, DAs’ scope of practice has varied substantially over time and across states. One particular procedure, taking X-rays, is now recognized by both the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and O*NET as a task routinely performed by DAs, yet it was allowed only through gradual scope-of-practice (SOP) expansions. At present, all states allow DAs to take X-rays; twenty states require a state-issued X-ray permit for this procedure. This paper focuses on the effects of these three regulations over the last four decades: the X-ray SOP expansion, the X-ray permit, and the entry-level license.====To study the effects of the regulations on the labor market, I use a generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) method exploiting variations across states in the timing of the regulations. I use the Current Population Survey (CPS) to obtain a sample of DAs and their hourly wages between 1979 and 2019. This data is supplemented with the decennial Census 1980–2000 and the American Community Survey (ACS) 2001–2019 for robustness, as the Census/ACS data offer a larger sample of minority DAs. However, Census/ACS does not provide hourly wages, but only annual earnings for all jobs held in the past 12 months, which may include income from other occupations.====The CPS estimates suggest that, in the absence of any occupational regulation, minority DAs’ wages are 11 percent lower than the wages of non-Hispanic white DAs with similar observable characteristics. The X-ray SOP expansion has large, positive, statistically significant effects on both average wages and the employment of DAs. The X-ray permit requirement, although having small effects on overall wages and employment, is associated with a statistically significant 8 percent reduction in the size of the wage gap between non-Hispanic whites and minorities (henceforth, the racial wage gap). In other words, the X-ray permit requirement reduces the racial wage gap. This income-equalizing effect is also found in the Census/ACS data, where the X-ray permit requirement reduces the annual income gap between non-Hispanic whites and minorities by 6 percent.====In contrast, although estimates for the effects of entry-level licensing are sensitive to the choice of dataset and the inclusion of state-specific trends, all estimates point to either a widening of the racial wage gap or null effects on the racial wage gap. The CPS estimates suggest that entry-level licensing has small, statistically non-significant effects on average wages but is associated with a 5 to 6 percent increase in the size of the racial wage gap (albeit only statistically significant at the 10 percent level).==== The Census/ACS estimates suggest small effects (less than 1 percent) on both average earnings and the racial income gap.====What could account for the differences between the effects of the entry-level license and the X-ray permit? Recent empirical research suggests that licensing with stringent qualification requirements reduces the representation of minorities in an occupation, plausibly because minorities have more difficulties fulfilling the licensing requirements (Cathles, Harrington, Krynski, 2010, Federman, Harrington, Krynski, 2006). Several recent papers also show that licensing can improve the employment opportunities of minorities and reduce the racial/gender wage gap if the license reveals information that would otherwise be difficult to ascertain (Blair, Chung, 2018, Law, Marks, 2009, Law, Marks, 2017).====Could these mechanisms be at play here? Entry-level procedures involve low risk and are always performed when the supervising dentist is present in the treatment room; in contrast, DAs usually take X-rays without the dentist’s immediate presence in the treatment room (Bird and Robinson, 2017, p. 35). X-ray procedures also involve higher risk due to the harm of radiation exposure and the potential for cross-contamination of equipment and environmental surfaces (Bird and Robinson, 2017, p. 629). Hence, a DA’s competence is particularly crucial for X-ray procedures. To the extent that information regarding minorities’ competence is noisier than information about non-minorities’ (Bartik, Nelson, 2019, Card, Giuliano, 2016), a risk-averse dentist-employer is less likely to hire a minority for X-ray procedures. The X-ray permit requires at least six hours of training and the passage of an exam on dental radiography. These requirements provide some assurance about the DA’s ability to take X-rays and can plausibly alleviate statistical discrimination by reducing the information asymmetry between dentists and minority DAs.====To test these mechanisms, I investigate whether the possession of an alternative signal of ability changes the effects of the X-ray permit. Arcidiacono et al. (2010) show that statistical discrimination is less severe among college graduates because post-secondary education allows individuals to signal their ability to potential employers. I split the sample in two, the DAs who have never attended college and those who have had some post-secondary education, to examine how the effects of licensing vary by DAs’ education level. The wage-equalizing effects of the X-ray permit are larger for DAs who have never attended college than for DAs who have attended some college, suggesting that the X-ray permit serves as a signal of quality that substitutes the education signal.====I also estimate the effects of the education and exam requirements associated with entry-level and X-ray procedures. Results suggest that, for the X-ray procedures, education/exam requirements alone, unaccompanied by a state-issued license, do not reduce the racial wage gap. For entry-level procedures, the education requirement alone poses enough of an entry barrier for DAs, amounting to a barrier similar to that of the entry-level license requirement.==== This is consistent with Cathles et al. (2010) and Federman et al. (2006)’s findings that stringent qualification requirements reduce the representation of minorities in an occupation. Event study graphs suggest that, like the entry-level license, the X-ray permit also has supply-restricting effects in the first few years after implementation. However, as minority DAs acquire the X-ray permit over time, the quality-signaling effects of the permit overcome the supply-restricting effects.====These findings relate to a body of research that shows licensing can be a barrier to entry that restricts labor supply (Friedman, Kuznets, 1945, Gittleman, Klee, Kleiner, 2018, Kleiner, 2013, Kleiner, Kudrle, 2000, Kugler, Sauer, 2005, Thornton, Timmons, 2013, Timmons, Thornton, 2008). These previous studies all find large positive effects of licensing on incumbents’ earnings. In contrast, the entry-level licensing studied here has small effects on average DA wages or income. This difference is not surprising as DAs are regulated by dentists – their employers – whereas the occupations in previous studies are mostly self-regulated. I find suggestive evidence that all three regulations are associated with positive, albeit statistically non-significant, changes in dentists’ hourly earnings, which attests to the hypothesis that the regulations were adopted by dentists for the benefit of dentists. Section 2.4 explores the factors that influence the timing of the regulations.====Recent empirical research also shows that licensing can enhance efficiency by reducing information asymmetry, particularly in markets where quality information is important but difficult to ascertain (Anderson, Brown, Charles, Rees, 2020, Law, Kim, 2005). A separate strand of research shows that information regarding minorities’ ability or qualification is often noisier, which gives rises to statistical discrimination; policies such as standardized testing, drug tests, credit checks, and criminal background checks can enhance minority workers’ educational (Card and Giuliano, 2016) and employment opportunities (Bartik, Nelson, 2019, Doleac, Hansen, 2020, Wozniak, 2015) by providing more precise information than what would be revealed in an interview. Recent papers have shown that occupational licensing can also enhance minority workers’ labor market outcomes by reducing information asymmetries regarding worker quality (Blair, Chung, 2018, Law, Marks, 2009, Law, Marks, 2017).====This paper also contributes to the study of the labor markets for non-physician health workers (Thurston, Libby, 2000, Thurston, Libby, 2002) and adds to a growing literature on SOP regulations for non-physician health workers (Kleiner, Marier, Park, Wing, 2016, Kleiner, Park, 2010, Markowitz, Adams, Lewitt, Dunlop, 2017, Stange, 2014, Wanchek, 2010, Wing, Marier, 2014). I review these papers in Section 2. The main difference between DAs and the occupations in previous studies – nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and hygienists – is that DAs have less autonomy and are complements for dentists in the production function (DeVany, Gramm, Saving, Smithson, 1982, Thurston, Libby, 2002). In contrast, the previously studied occupations are imperfect substitutes for doctors/dentists (Kleiner, Marier, Park, Wing, 2016, Wing, Marier, 2014).",Barrier to Entry or Signal of Quality?

Motghare Swapnil,"Pulte Institute for Global Development, University of Notre Dame, 2139 Jenkins Nanovic Halls, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Received 19 April 2018, Revised 18 June 2021, Accepted 21 June 2021, Available online 25 June 2021, Version of Record 21 July 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2021.102025,Cited by (0),"I study how New York City taxicab drivers change their work hours in response to a permanent wage change. Exploiting the effective wage increase induced by a regulatory change in fares, I estimate the long-run elasticity of labor supply to be -0.5. I show that the data limitations may have biased the estimates in a previous study that also use data for New York City taxicab drivers. Since the drivers are almost exclusively males, the estimate likely represents male labor supply elasticity. The negative elasticity is consistent with rising wages and declining work hours per worker observed over many decades, and is useful evidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.","How do individuals adjust their work hours in response to a permanent wage change? Knowing the responsiveness of labor supply to wage change is important to understand the implications of policies affecting individuals’ budget constraint. These policies range from tax and welfare programs to the alteration of institutional features of labor markets. Consequently, this understanding is crucial for the effective design of tax/transfer systems, and for assessing the efficiency costs of labor income taxation (Keane, 2011). The Congressional Budget Office periodically reviews different types of labor supply elasticities to understand the changes in the economy’s supply of labor in response to adjustments in federal tax rates (McClelland, Mok, 2012, Reichling, Whalen, 2012, and Russek et al., 1996).==== Another motivation to study labor supply response to wage change is to explain the secular decline in the work hours per worker over last many decades (Kopytov et al., 2020). One of the explanations for this decline has been that rising productivity and wages reduce work hours through the income effect.====The theoretical prediction for the labor supply response to a permanent-unanticipated wage change is ambiguous. In the standard neoclassical static model of labor supply, a permanent wage change is associated with income and substitution effects which go in opposite directions. For example, in the case of a wage increase, the income effect causes work hours to decrease while the substitution effect causes work hours to increase. The net effect of the wage increase thus depends on the strength of the income and substitution effects.====There are two common problems in observing the labor supply response to a permanent wage change. First, it is difficult to find an exogenous permanent wage change. Wage changes, either within or across jobs, may be correlated with employee unobservable characteristics or may be accompanied by changes in responsibilities, both of which may affect work hours directly. A second issue is the worker’s inflexibility in adjusting work hours as documented in Blundell et al. (2008) and Golden, Lonnie and Gebreselassie, Tesfayi (2007). The work hours are typically decided by the employer and can rarely be adjusted by the worker. Thus, even with an exogenous wage change, we may not observe people changing work hours. Field experiments that generate a permanent change in the wage would be financially infeasible.====Several papers have studied the labor supply response to a permanent wage change by estimating the Marshallian elasticity, which is the percentage change in work hours for a one percent change in wage. The literature has differentiated elasticities for males and women as they are considered to have very different elasticities. One stream of literature has addressed the wage endogeneity issue by either using instruments for wages or employing a difference-in-difference framework by using exogenous wage changes generated by tax policy changes (Blundell, Duncan, Meghir, 1998, Eissa, 1995 and other studies mentioned in Blundell and Macurdy (1999)). Most of these studies have found small and positive Marshallian elasticities for men: a simple average of Marshallian elasticities in 23 studies reviewed in Keane (2011) is +0.06 (median = +0.05).====In another stream of literature, researchers have focused on case studies of groups of workers in which a clear source of wage variation can be identified, and where individuals are free to choose work hours. Although the results are less generalizable, the knowledge of workers and institutional details make these studies attractive.==== Boulier (1979) studies the labor supply of self-employed dentists using cross-sectional data collected in 1968 and finds that their annual hours are negatively related to the price of a tooth extraction with an elasticity of -0.049. Doran (2014) exploits the fare change in 2004 to estimate the wage elasticity of daily hours for New York City taxicab drivers to be +0.05. Pencavel (2015) studies the labor supply of workers at plywood mills in the Pacific Northwest from 1968 to 1986. Modeling these co-operative mills as a group of self-employed individuals who collectively decide their hours worked, the estimated elasticity of supply of hours worked is -0.3, although it is imprecisely estimated.====In the same vein, Ashenfelter et al. (2010) study the hours response to wage changes of New York City (NYC) taxicab drivers by estimating their long-run elasticity of labor supply.==== These drivers were free to choose their work hours, and they experienced a change in their hourly wage due to changes in the fare structure in March 1996 and May 2004. Comparing the driving behavior of the taxis before and after the fare change, the authors estimate long-run wage elasticity for drivers who own their taxis to be -0.2. Thus, for a 10% increase in hourly wage, the drivers decreased their work hours by 2%.====However, there are some limitations of the data used in Ashenfelter et al. (2010), which might have resulted in biased estimates. First, the estimation uses only a small sample of taxi owners who self-report driving the taxis and do not rent them to other drivers. The study thus provides no information on the choices of the large majority of taxi drivers who are employed as contract workers by taxi companies (around 90% of all drivers). These “renter-drivers” may have a different response to wage changes as compared to the “owner-drivers”. For example, since the owner-drivers experienced an additional income effect due to an increase in medallion prices after the fare change, they are likely to reduce their work hours by a larger amount. The estimated owner-driver elasticity will thus be more negative as compared to that of the renters (and average driver). Second, even for the subsample of owner-drivers who self-report driving their taxis exclusively, the medallion fixed effect may not be a good proxy for driver fixed effect if these drivers rent the taxi to other drivers. In such a case, the medallion hours and wage may not correspond to owner hours and wage which can affect the elasticity estimate. For example, in the extreme case when owners only rent their taxis and don’t drive themselves, the estimation sample would comprise only renters, who experienced smaller income effects and hence a smaller reduction in hours. Thus, the estimated elasticity will be biased in the positive direction as compared to the true elasticity of owner-drivers. Lastly, the estimation uses miles driven as a proxy for work hours. If the driver waiting time, such as time spent stuck in traffic or queuing at the airport, is significant, or if the driver-specific speed changes as the fare changes, this can cause measurement error in work hours leading to division bias (Borjas (1980)). In presence of division bias, the estimated elasticity will be a weighted average of true elasticity and minus one. Since these biases go in opposite directions, the net effect on the estimate is ambiguous.====In this paper, I estimate the long-run elasticity of labor supply of NYC taxicab drivers using a new dataset and fare change that allows me to overcome the data limitations in Ashenfelter et al. (2010). I use electronically recorded trip records for the universe of NYC yellow cab drivers that enables me to (a) estimate the elasticity using the population of all the drivers (instead of a subsample of owner-drivers), (b) directly control for driver fixed effects (instead of medallion fixed effects), and (c) use exact measures of work hours (instead of using miles driven as a proxy for hours). I use a fixed effects instrumental variable regression model to estimate the wage elasticity. The instrument that causes an exogenous change in the wage is the city-wide fare change that affected all drivers in the data. I first show that the fare change resulted in increased driver hourly wages. I then use the fare change indicator as an instrument for the wage in a labor supply equation to estimate the wage elasticity. The identification relies on the exogeneity of the fare change to the labor supply equation. I argue that this assumption holds because the fare change is unlikely to affect driver preferences to work through any other path than wage change.====The results show that the fare change increased driver hourly wages by 12.8% (====$3.5) and decreased monthly work hours by 6.4% (====11 hours), leading to a long-run wage elasticity of -0.5: for a 10% ==== in the hourly wage, the drivers ==== their work hours by 5%. Thus, the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Drivers respond both at the intensive and extensive margins by driving fewer shifts and fewer hours per shift. At the market level, this decrease in work hours only marginally affects the aggregate supply of rides, as the slack created by the decrease in work hours by drivers is compensated by new drivers entering the market. Since the model essentially does a “before-after” comparison within drivers, one needs to be careful about other changes occuring along with the fare change that might have influenced work hours or wages. I discuss such changes and argue that their effect on elasticity estimate is likely to be small.====Since positive elasticities are theoretically possible, I explore the heterogeneity of the elasticity estimate by hours quantiles and driver types. The quantile estimates suggest that while the elasticities are likely negative for the entire distribution of hours, the magnitude is smaller at lower quantiles. This is plausible as the lower hours quantiles experienced a smaller income effect and hence reduce work hours by a smaller amount. Comparing subsamples of drivers, I find negative elasticities for full-time and part-time drivers, drivers who drive during different times of the day, renter-drivers and owner-drivers. Thus, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that elasticity is negative for different hours quantiles and several driver types. I do not find positive elasticities.====The long-run elasticity estimate in Ashenfelter et al. (2010) (-0.2) is smaller in magnitude than what this paper finds (-0.5). I explore if the data limitations in Ashenfelter et al. (2010) can explain the difference. I replicate results in Ashenfelter et al. (2010) using the same data source and estimate a smaller-in-magnitude elasticity of -0.4. I find that focusing on owner-drivers moves the elasticity estimate in the negative direction. These owner-drivers experience the same wage increase but reduce the work hours by a larger amount, likely because of the additional income effect due to an increase in the medallion price. On the other hand, I find that the bias due to using medallion fixed effect as a proxy for driver fixed effect moves the elasticity estimate in the positive direction. Owner-drivers are frequently observed renting their taxis, which creates the possibility that the medallion hours and wage may not correspond to owner hours and wage. Elasticity estimates with and without these shared taxis are different, suggesting this bias is substantial. Furthermore, I show (theoretically) that pooling the owners and renters using medallion fixed effect causes the estimated hours change and elasticity to be biased in the positive direction. Lastly, the division bias is found to be negligible, suggesting that the instrumental variable estimation strategy corrects for this bias. Thus, if the bias due to using medallion fixed effect as a proxy for driver fixed effect is strong, it is possible to get an estimate that is smaller in magnitude than what I find, explaining the difference in estimates.====The study makes several contributions to the labor supply literature. First, the results add to the literature on Marshallian labor supply elasticity of men by presenting an elasticity estimate that is more negative than many previous studies. Second, the analysis shows that the previous estimate using data from the same labor market may have been biased due to data limitations. Third, the negative elasticity supports the argument that rising wages and the resulting income effect is one of the reasons for the decline in the work hours per worker over many decades. Finally, the results provide insights into the labor supply of individuals in an industry that is largely under scrutiny due to the entry of Uber and other ride-sharing apps, and one that has been extensively studied by labor economists.====The most direct policy implication of the results is for designing policies regulating ride-sharing apps that affect the permanent wages of taxicab drivers. Focusing on NYC taxicab drivers limits generalizing the elasticity for other workers. However, since the drivers are almost exclusively males, a case can be made that the elasticity estimate is closer to the elasticity of males. More studies like these in other settings should provide useful evidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.",The long-run elasticity of labor supply: New evidence for New York City taxicab drivers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000609,25 June 2021,2021,Research Article,187.0

I develop a model of ==== and detail the conditions that determine joint-aim appraisal systems’ contribution to teacher productivity. I then simulate the long-term effects of a set of teacher evaluation policies. Policies that treat evaluation for accountability and evaluation for growth as substitutes outperform those that treat them as complements. I conclude that an optimal teacher evaluation policy would impose accountability on teachers performing below a defined level and above which teachers would be subject to no accountability pressure but would receive intensive instructional supports.,"Most organizations seek to design employee evaluation systems that encourage workers to put forth maximal effort, that permit differentiated rewards and sanctions for various performance levels, and that stimulate employee skill development through feedback and learning generated as part of the appraisal process. The purported mechanisms through which present-day teacher evaluation design might improve the average quality of instruction are through (a) incentives to motivate teachers, (b) tools for retaining high-performing teachers and deselecting low-performing ones, (c) shifts to the labor market pool of prospective teachers, and (d) feedback mechanisms to improve the skills of current teachers. Most consequential teacher evaluation policies attempt to achieve a blend of these accountability and skill developmental goals. While these multiple goals are firmly part of the design of most modern teacher evaluation policies, researchers and policy makers have reflected surprisingly little on their interactions.====In this paper, I argue that a clear explication of the tenets underlying teacher evaluation policies is critical to estimating their likelihood of success. I develop a stylized model of teacher effectiveness that includes improvement from evaluation. My model’s central contribution is to highlight that improvement in teaching effectiveness from evaluation depends not only on the independent effects of accountability pressures and skill development supports, but also on their interaction. From this model, I identify several conditions that determine the effectiveness of potential teacher evaluation policy designs.====I then develop a set of simple simulations to assess the effect of policies that emphasize the growth or accountability aims of teacher evaluation. To do so, I draw on the current causal evidence base to select parameters related to my model’s production function. I build on prior work from Staiger and Rockoff (2010), Winters and Cowen (2013) and Rothstein (2015). I extend their simulations by allowing for teachers to improve their skills as a result of evaluation, by assessing the effect of evaluation policies on outcomes beyond test scores, and by explicitly modeling potential interactions between accountability pressures and skill development in teacher evaluation designs. As Rothstein notes, models that incorporate selection and deselection effects into and out of the profession are ill-suited to evaluation by experiment (either random assignment or natural) because their effects take a decade or more to manifest. This fact motivates my simulation.====My simulations shed light not only on particular conditions that determine the effectiveness of teacher evaluation, but also provide insights on four broad typologies of teacher evaluation frameworks relevant to many countries’ policy-making contexts. I model the effects of teacher evaluation policies that (====) impose accountability pressures on all teachers; (====) provide developmental supports for all teachers; (====) combine accountability pressures with skill development supports for all teachers; and (====) apply accountability pressures to one group of teachers and skill development supports to a different group. I describe the third policy design as treating evaluation for accountability and evaluation for growth as complements and the fourth design as treating them as substitutes.====My simulation’s central contribution is that, given reasonable parameter bounds derived from the causal literature, the potential benefits of an evaluation system that applies accountability and growth supports to all teachers are dwarfed by its potential risks. My simulations synthesize Winters and Cowen’s (2013) conclusion that the hypothesized benefits of dismissing less effective teachers are muted by natural attrition with Rothstein’s (2015) insights that a skill-constrained supply of prospective teachers influences optimal dismissal rates. The critical insights my simulations contribute beyond theirs and those by Staiger and Rockoff (2010) is that evaluation may improve teacher effectiveness in addition to serving as a mechanism for dismissal. In fact, the most important determinants for improving average teacher effectiveness are the rate of skill development from ongoing supervisor feedback over several years and the labor supply effects of evaluation policies, both of which are empirically indeterminate. Even if evaluation for growth and evaluation for accountability have cross-productivity effects, the upper-bounds on these effects are relatively low. Thus, evaluation policies that jointly maximize skill development rates of current teachers and starting skill endowments of future teachers hold the most promise. As a result, I conclude that an evaluation policy that treats evaluation for growth and accountability as substitutes rather than complements is more likely, across various plausible scenarios, to produce improved student outcomes.",Teacher evaluation for accountability and growth: Should policy treat them as complements or substitutes?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000592,22 June 2021,2021,Research Article,188.0

We exploit the variation in cohorts’ composition across time and students’ exogenous allocation across classrooms to deal with selection issues. Our results suggest that peer ability does not significantly affect students’ short-term academic outcomes but has positive long-term impacts on formal labor market participation and the decision to enroll in graduate studies. Our findings suggest that peers in young adulthood may have a more considerable influence on behaviors than on short-term academic outcomes.","Understanding how peer composition affects individual outcomes is crucial for a better insight into human capital accumulation and designing more effective educational policies. The existence of peer effects has important implications regarding the optimal allocation of students between schools and classrooms. In the context of higher education, peer effects are essential for guiding affirmative action policies and financing and admission policies in a broader sense. Moreover, peer effects may impact long-term outcomes that extend well beyond schools.====We contribute to the literature by providing evidence of ability peer effects in higher education on short- and long-term educational and labor market outcomes. To do so, we take advantage of longitudinal data over twelve years with detailed information on incoming students from the prestigious Faculty of Economics, Business, and Accounting at the University of Sao Paulo (USP) in Brazil.====In general, the empirical estimation of peer effects is challenging, as discussed by Manski (1993). First, groups of students are usually not formed randomly. Therefore, individuals belonging to the same group may have similar unobservable characteristics that confound the estimation of peer effects. Second, while an individual affects her peers’ outcomes, she is also affected by the group’s results, generating a problem of simultaneity. A solution for dealing with the simultaneity problem is to consider predetermined or time-invariant group characteristics, such as previous academic performance or gender.====Our identification strategy relies on students’ exogenous allocation across classrooms and idiosyncratic variation in the average ability of different cohorts (defined as a combination of admission year, major, and daytime or evening stream) of students across time, similar to Hoxby (2000).==== Since students cannot control their cohort or classroom composition, we use the natural fluctuation in cohort characteristics to estimate how peers affect individual outcomes such as performance and dropout in university, graduate school enrollment, and formal labor market participation up to 15 years after college admission. As we have information on students’ predetermined ability through university admission exam records, we can also deal with the simultaneity problem. While we do not detect any impact of ability peer effects on academic results at university, we find that peers impact graduate school enrollment and labor market participation in the long run.====Other studies attempt to estimate peer effects by seeking exogenous sources of variation in group formation to deal with the selection problem.==== In higher education, many studies take advantage of students’ random allocation to dorms to estimate how roommates affect academic outcomes. Some examples are Sacerdote (2001), Zimmerman (2003), Foster (2006), Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006), Griffith and Rask (2014) and Mehta et al. (2019) who use data from American universities; Han and Li (2009), Brunello et al. (2010), and Jain and Kapoor (2015) who use data from China, Italy and India, respectively. Overall, the evidence points to mixed results. Some studies find positive peer effects on performance. In contrast, other studies find effects that are not significant or vary according to students’ characteristics or the outcome.====However, it is not clear that roommates’ peer effects are comparable to those occurring in larger groups or classrooms, which are likely to be the most relevant unit of analysis when considering ability peer effects. Moreover, in higher education, measuring peer effects can be particularly challenging. In most countries, the random assignment of students to classrooms is not usual. In the United States, first-year students typically do not choose a field of study and take classes in different subjects, making the definition of the relevant peer group challenging.====Arcidiacono and Nicholson (2005) circumvent some of these issues by focusing on students who graduated from U.S. medical schools between 1996 and 1998. When controlling for school-specific fixed effects to deal with endogenous group formation, they find that peers do not significantly impact individuals’ performance and specialty choices. Additionally, a few studies use the random allocation of students to peer groups in military settings in the U.S. to study ability peer effects in higher education, such as Lyle, 2007, Lyle, 2009, Carrell et al. (2009) and Brady et al. (2017). They find evidence of significant peer effects, although impacts are heterogeneous and depend on groups’ definitions. However, in the military, the interaction between peers is more intense than in many higher education settings, as students also live together.====Outside of the U.S., there is some evidence of significant ability peer effects in higher education in environments where teaching methods rely on group work, such as tutorials. Using data from the Netherlands, Feld and Zölitz (2017) and Booij et al. (2017) take advantage of students’ random assignment to workgroups and tutorials to study ability peer effects in university. While results differ for low- and high-ability students, both studies find that medium-ability students benefit from brighter peers. Using data from a selective French university where class size is small (25 to 30 students), Brodaty and Gurgand (2016) show that teacher effects are strong, but peer group effects are negligible.====Notably, a growing literature shows that peer effects in school may affect other long-term dimensions such as college (Bifulco, Fletcher, Jung Oh, Ross, 2014, Bifulco, Fletcher, Ross, 2011, Fischer, 2017, Mouganie, Wang, 2020) and labor market outcomes (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2013, Carrell, Hoekstra, Kuka, 2018), as well as future interactions between ethnic groups (Carrell et al., 2019). In contrast, Anelli and Peri (2017) find that high-school peers have little impact on major choice, college completion, and labor market outcomes. For college students, there is also evidence that peers impact major choice (Giorgi et al., 2010).====In contrast with most of the literature, we analyze a higher education context where teachers adopt more traditional teaching methods, such as lectures, and student interactions mainly occur during class time, as undergrads rarely live in university dormitories or shared apartments.==== Our institutional context is particularly favorable to investigate the presence of classroom peer effects. The undergraduate office automatically enrolls first-semester students in a set of compulsory courses. Students attend classes either with their entire cohort or in one of two sections based on their first names. Within a cohort, sections are constant, and students attend the same courses, ensuring a high degree of interaction. First-semester undergrads also participate in many social events in the first week of classes, which guarantees that they get to know each other before courses begin. Importantly, undergraduates have no discretion over which courses or sections to attend in the first semester. The first-semester allocation highly correlates with subsequent class allocation, even if some students may switch sections and choose some elective courses in later terms.====Apart from tracking students up to 15 years after university admission, our data also allows us to consider different sets of peers for a given student and address the challenge of measuring peer influences at the appropriate level. In general, capturing the proper level of peer interaction in higher education is not straightforward. Indeed, Sacerdote (2011) hypothesizes that the inability to identify the correct peer group could be behind the non-significant effects found in most of the literature. In our main specification, we restrict the peer group to students who attended courses together. For course outcomes, we also take a more restrictive approach and perform an analysis at the student-course level using course fixed effects. Finally, we also present results by employing a broad definition of peers, composed of the entire cohort.====Our results show that when students’ interactions occur mostly in classroom environments, peer effects in contemporary academic outcomes are bound to be negligible. However, peers seem to affect individuals’ prospects regarding graduate school enrollment and labor market participation. One standard deviation increase in cohort peer ability increases labor market participation by up to 15 percentage points and the probability of enrolling in graduate school by 10 to 12 percentage points.====Thus, our paper contributes to the literature on peer effects in higher education in several critical dimensions. First, compared to most existing studies, ours has the advantage of relying on a long span of longitudinal data, which allows us to follow students 15 years after university admission, and a larger sample. Second, the nature of peer effects we study, mainly driven by interactions between students attending classes together, is relevant for many higher education settings and likely to be considerably different from contexts where students also live together. Third, by considering different sets of peers, we can better deal with peer influences at the appropriate level. Finally, we provide evidence of classroom peer effects from a prestigious university in Brazil. This setting makes our study quite relevant from a policy perspective, given that Brazilian (selective) universities have extensively implemented affirmative action policies in the last few years.====We structure this paper as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information on higher education in Brazil, the University of Sao Paulo (USP), and its Faculty of Economics, Business, and Accounting. In Section 3, we present the data and some descriptive statistics. We present our empirical strategy and results in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

Our analysis leverages information from a Chinese online job board and a firm-level measure of tariff exposure obtained from customs transactions data. Firms that are more exposed to US tariffs on Chinese goods responded by posting fewer job vacancies and offering ====. The latter is partly balanced out by increased non-wage compensation. We also find a negative relationship between US-tariff exposure and the educational background required in firms’ job ads. China’s retaliatory tariffs against the US does not appear to have a statistically significant systematic impact on hiring. The paper also reports heterogeneous adjustment patterns across firms of different size, ownership and product mix. Overall, the trade war reveals to have negative impact on firms and job-seekers in China.","The recent escalation of the US-China trade war resulted in a substantial disruption of trade between the two countries. US imports from China hit a 5-year low in 2019, ranging about 33bn US dollars below their value from 2015. US exports to China were about 9.5bn dollars below 2015-levels. Comparing shipments in 2016-2017 to the years 2018-2019, US imports from China decreased by 14-23 percent, while US shipments to China decreased by 15-27 percent.====Disruptions are not limited to aggregate trade flows. While exposed exporting firms have to cope with an artificial increase in the price of their sold products, importers have to pay more for their purchases or find new suppliers. Both see their competitiveness eroding and lower sales and profits force them to re-optimize their cost structure and investment decisions, including their labor demand.====In this paper, we use newly collected information from online job-vacancy postings in China to document firm-level reactions to the trade war reflected in labor demand. By observing information on the number and content of online job ads between May and November 2019, we capture the most recent round of US tariff increases and Chinese retaliation. This enables us to evaluate responses to the trade war at an early stage of firms’ hiring process along several dimensions. Our results provide novel insights into the propagation of short-term responses by firms to adverse trade policy shocks.====An important feature of the trade war is that the introduction of new tariffs did not follow a rule-based rationale in the context of conventional WTO anti-dumping or safeguarding regulations. In fact, the US administration first based tariffs on national security interests, but later raised tariffs on goods even if they were not currently imported from China (Bown, Kolb, 2019, Handley, Kamal, Monarch, 2020). This lends support to a key identifying assumption: that Chinese firms had no influence on the timing, magnitude and coverage of the tariffs.==== Moreover, magnitude and product coverage of the additional (discriminatory) tariffs have been unseen for decades, which enables us to study a policy experiment that is unique in contemporary economic history.====Indeed, the theoretical linkages between tariffs and firms’ labor demand can be manifold and predicted outcomes are potentially ambiguous. Some intuition can be derived from trade models with heterogeneous firms and imperfect product-market competition (Melitz, 2003, Melitz, Ottaviano, 2008, Melitz, Trefler, 2012). Depending on modeling assumptions and initial product-market conditions, tariffs are either fully or partly passed through to customers, while lower profits follow in both cases. With (partial) pass-through and downward-sloping demand, exporters face lower sales, downscale their production, and might eventually demand less labor. Moreover, (partial) absorption of a tariff-induced price increase might result in lower salary offers by firms, as they seek to preserve market access (and restore profit margins) through lowering their factor costs.====Adjustments by firms facing new tariffs on their imports after Chinese retaliation are more difficult to predict. On the one hand, firms sourcing intermediate inputs from the US might switch to alternative (second best) suppliers, which potentially undermines their competitiveness ==== less exposed firms (e.g., Handley et al., 2020b). Fewer job postings could reflect an ensuing decline in labor demand. On the other hand, instead of switching suppliers, exposed firms could manufacture the tariffed inputs themselves and hire additional workers.==== This is reminiscent of the rationale proclaimed by the US administration when it imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods: higher tariffs might boost domestic production and employment through import substitution.====At least two elements complicate such reasoning. First, the US-China trade war has created substantial economic uncertainty among Chinese firms (Benguria et al., 2020). While selection, timing, and magnitude of additional tariffs did not follow any rule-based mechanism, also their duration is unknown. Second, job vacancy postings signal firms’ willingness to invest ==== into their ==== workforce. With the future being uncertain, such investments might be delayed, so that a positive employment effect becomes less likely to materialize in the short run (Bloom, Bond, Van Reenen, 2007, Ghosal, Ye, 2015, Stein, Stone). Further complicating elements relate to the characteristics of the Chinese labor market itself. Depending on the intensity at which firms compete for qualified staff, there might be more or less room for adjustments in published salary offers. Similarly, formal and informal labor market institutions that determine the costs of hiring, firing and delayed hiring might influence firms’ adjustments.====Against this background, we present reduced-form evidence on the effects of tariffs on firms’ labor demand, as reflected by their publicly posted hiring announcements via a major Chinese job-portal. A main advantage of using online job advertisements is their rich information that is typically not observable in firm-level census or survey data. This includes, for instance, the number of open positions and their change over time, as well as the average wage offered for a particular job. Besides this, we are able to observe different forms of non-wage compensation (such as bonuses, subsidies and insurance packages) as well as specifications of job prerequisites (e.g., previous working experience or educational background). Our identification strategy relies on a firm-specific measure of exposure to the trade war, which we construct based on pre-trade war information about firms’ product mix and trade partners in a matched firm-level customs data set.====Our panel regression results suggest that firms exposed to higher US tariffs responded by posting systematically fewer job ads. The reduction amounts to about 2.4-3.2 percent for an average firm, which adds up to about 5,600 fewer job postings in total. A negative impact is also found for the average wage compensation indicated in the job ads. Our estimated 0.5 percent decrease corresponds to about $70 lower earnings per year in an average job offer. Such reductions appear to be balanced out partly by other forms of compensation, such as bonuses. This might suggest that firms shift towards more flexible and performance-based compensation schemes as they face higher US tariffs. Moreover, we find a robust and negative relationship between US-tariff exposure and the required educational background, while requirements on previous job experience do not show any statistically significant response. The reduction in educational-background requirements might reflect that US tariffs disproportionately targeted relatively skill-intensive products.====In contrast to these findings, we do not detect any comparable systematic adjustments to China’s retaliatory tariffs on US products. While the sign of the corresponding coefficient tends to be the opposite of that for US tariffs, their magnitude and precision are substantially lower. This is similar to findings of related studies in the US, where import tariffs fail to create new jobs or boost manufacturing sector performance (e.g. Flaaen, Pierce, Goswami). In fact, any notable producer gains seem to be either offset by costlier imported inputs, or by the recent (and potentially temporary) nature of these tariffs that prevents firms from investing into new jobs quickly.==== Our main findings are maintained after submitting our results to a number of robustness checks, although we document some differential responses across firms of different size, ownership, or product mix.====Overall, the US-China trade war appears to hurt both firms and job-seekers, creating losers on both sides. This conclusion is in line and complementary to existing studies on the trade war, which focus primarily on the US economy (Amiti, Kong, Weinstein, 2020, Amiti, Redding, Weinstein, Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, Khandelwal, 2020, Flaaen, Pierce, Goswami, Handley, Kamal, Monarch, 2020, Waugh, 2019) or on trade and investment effects in third countries (Egger, Zhu, 2019, Meinen, Schulte, Cigna, Steinhoff, 2019). We add to this literature by shedding light on the experience of Chinese importers and exporters during this episode of political escalation.====Our reduced-form evidence provides novel insights on short-term labor-market effects of the trade war. While existing studies typically rely on more aggregated regional labor market data, we uncover another layer by observing firm-level adjustments in the number and content of vacancy postings over time. Our findings are also similar to Javorcik et al. (2019), who report decreasing online-hiring activity in the UK after the Brexit referendum, due to increased trade policy uncertainty. While their approach relies on differential industry-sector and regional exposure to a major trade-policy shock, we explicitly control for aggregate variation along these dimensions to document more nuanced adjustments ==== firms. Our findings corroborate evidence on the adverse effects of international political disintegration and uncertainty on economic activity. Finally, by using newly collected data from a Chinese job board, our study also contributes to a growing literature which uses online vacancy postings to analyze and compare labor market dynamics in different countries, as we will discuss in the following section.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces and describes our data in detail, along with the sample used to carry out the analysis of the present paper and its potential limitations. In Section 3, we provide additional background information on key events of the trade war, which are relevant for our identification. Section 4 explains our empirical strategy to identify the impact of tariffs on labor demand. Section 5 presents our results, including robustness checks, explorations of heterogeneous responses across firms, and a short discussion of the implications of our findings.

Occupational mismatch has been implicated as driving up to two thirds of it. However, obtaining the high quality ==== data for vacancies by job occupation that are required to measure occupational mismatch is a significant challenge. We confront this issue by using a weighted dataset of 15 million job adverts posted online that cover most of the post-crisis period and that enable us to test whether occupational mismatch still stands up as an explanation for the UK productivity puzzle. We find little evidence that it does, mainly because, relative to the data used in similar analysis by Patterson et al. (2016), our vacancy data imply greater heterogeneity in occupational matching frictions, a key determinant of the optimal distribution of labour across job types.","Since the Great Financial Crisis, UK productivity and output have fallen significantly and mysteriously behind their pre-2008 trend in both levels and growth rates (Barnett, Batten, Chiu, Franklin, Sebastia-Barriel, et al., 2014, Bryson, Forth, 2015, Haldane, 2017), as shown in Fig. 1. There has been controversy over what has caused this dramatic change in the behaviour of productivity. One explanation of the puzzle, introduced by Patterson et al. (2016), is that occupational mismatch between workers and available jobs is causing a significant fraction, up to two-thirds, of the productivity puzzle.====This paper uses new, big data on job vacancies to show occupational mismatch does not in fact explain a significant proportion of the UK productivity puzzle. Our vacancy data side-steps issues with the administrative vacancy data previously used to look at the contribution of mismatch to the productivity puzzle and we also include all of the UK in our analysis. We use a combination of vacancy stock data and official data to construct counter-factual paths for output, productivity, and employment that show what would have happened in the absence of occupational mismatch.====Using new data, we fundamentally challenge the view that the productivity puzzle is largely driven by occupational mismatch. We find no evidence of mismatch contributing to the productivity puzzle. Our results are driven by significant heterogeneity in how easily workers are matched to jobs across occupations.====The UK productivity puzzle remains stubbornly difficult to solve. A range of mismeasurement or output revision issues have been offered as explanations, including the way intangibles such as research and development are measured (Haskel et al., 2015), and erroneous pre-crisis measurements of the productivity of the finance sector. Of a 16 percentage point puzzle in level terms in 2013Q4, Barnett et al. (2014b) suggest that mismeasurement could explain 4 percentage points, while another 6 to 9 could be accounted for by investment in intangibles, high rates of firm survival, and impaired resource allocation. The UK’s high wage flexibility has also been touted as a possible cause Pessoa and Van Reenen (2014), Blundell et al. (2014): the fall in the price of labour coupled with the rise in the cost of capital has meant a fall in the capital to labour ratio and an associated fall in labour productivity. Cyclical explanations, including credit constraints (Riley et al., 2014) and labour hoarding (Martin and Rowthorn, 2012), struggle to explain the long duration of below trend productivity growth.====The analysis of mismatch in the labour market has a long history that begins with the indices of Nickell (1982), Lilien (1982), and Jackman and Roper (1987). The seminal work on how mismatch can negatively affect aggregate labour market outcomes is by Şahin et al. (2014) and looks at how mismatch can add to unemployment. This framework gives counter-factuals for unemployment, productivity, and output in a scenario in which a social planner can optimally assign jobseekers to reduce mismatch. Smith (2012) uses a similar framework to examine unemployment dynamics and, using UK JobCentre Plus data, estimates that around half of the rise in UK unemployment during the crisis was due to mismatch. We also adopt this mismatch framework.====The closest paper to ours is Patterson et al. (2016) who use the framework of Şahin et al. (2014) to show that the difference between the counter-factual and realised paths for productivity explain a significant fraction of the UK productivity puzzle between 2007 and 2012; namely up to two thirds of the deviation from the trend-growth in labour productivity. A substantial boost in aggregate output is also shown to result from eliminating occupational mismatch.====We make several key contributions relative to the existing literature. We revisit previous work by Patterson et al. (2016) suggesting that occupational mismatch is a major contributor to the UK’s productivity puzzle, finding a different conclusion. We extend the previous analysis to cover the whole of the UK==== and use a measure of unemployment based on designated national statistics rather than the less accurate Jobseeker Claimant Count. We demonstrate how naturally occurring==== big data on online job ads can be used for macroeconomic labour market analysis. We create new estimates of matching elasticity and matching efficiency by occupation. Finally, we uncover significant labour market heterogeneity across occupations that was not apparent in similar previous work.====The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the online job vacancies data and the other data we use to construct counter-factuals, Section 3 describes the search and matching theory we use and the mismatch theory of Şahin et al. (2014), and Section 4 presents results. Results are split into the estimation of the matching function (Section 4.1), counter-factual simulations (Section 4.3), and accounting for differences with the results of Patterson et al. (2016) (Section 4.4).

We provide new evidence based on unique longitudinal data on unemployed workers in Belgium, who were surveyed about self-reported reservation wages at the start of the unemployment spell, and after 3 and 6 months of unemployment duration. Our estimates suggest that reservation wages decline with unemployment duration by about 0.4 percent per month, or 5 percent per year, and that cross-sectional estimates are biased upward. We find stronger declines among men and among workers who earned high wages in their previous jobs. The paper discusses these findings in the light of learning models and discusses the implications of falling reservation wages for the debate on the effect of unemployment on wages.","There is a long-standing debate on how unemployment affects the wage demands of unemployed job seekers (Mortensen, 1970; Feldstein & Poterba, 1984; Addison et al., 2013; Krueger & Mueller, 2016). The reservation wage – also known as the acceptance wage or the minimum asking wage – is the minimal wage level at which a job seeker would accept a job offer. Economic intuition about market clearing and supply and demand pressures predicts that asking prices decline after a period of time if a product fails to sell – both in the labor market and in any other market such as the housing market. However, the phenomenon is perhaps more relevant in the labor market because it is likely to affect unemployment levels and starting wages across the business cycle.====Various job search theories explain why the optimal reservation wage might decline with unemployment duration, either because the value of leisure time and unemployment benefits decline over time (Kasper, 1967; Mortensen, 1986), because job seekers face liquidity constraints (Crosslin & Stevens, 1977), because of human capital depreciation or because of imperfect information and learning about the expected benefits of continued job search (McCall, 1970; Burdett & Vishwanath, 1988). However, little is known about the empirical relation between unemployment duration and reservation wages. Most existing studies rely on cross-sectional data, but identification is not straightforward with such data because OLS estimates are likely to be biased because of the reverse causal pathway from reservation wages to unemployment duration, and because valid instrumental variables are hard to find in this setting. There are some longitudinal studies but almost all these studies rely on yearly data from panel surveys (Addison et al., 2009; Pannenberg, 2010; Addison et al., 2013) in which identification is complicated by the fact that a full year is a long time step in unemployment spells and that it is often difficult to account for transitions between interviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study that relies on high-frequency longitudinal data. This seminal study by Krueger & Mueller (2016) contains the best available evidence – perhaps the only credible available evidence – on the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages. Krueger and Mueller conclude that “reservation wages decline at a modest rate” and the fact that in their full sample the estimated duration effect was not statistically significant led others to interpret the Krueger and Mueller study as showing that reservation wages are not affected by unemployment duration (Schmieder et al., 2016).====In this study we present original longitudinal data about the asking wages of job seekers in Belgium to identify the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages and to investigate how this effect varies with job seekers’ characteristics. The job seekers in our data were interviewed three times with three-month intervals. The main findings are that reservation wages decline with unemployment duration by about 0.4 percent per month and we find stronger declines among men and among workers who earned high wages in their previous jobs.====This study aims to contribute to various literatures. First, this study provides evidence on the decline of reservation wages with unemployment duration. The finding itself, which is essentially that asking prices are lowered over time as a product fails to sell, should be less surprising than the fact that this is the first study to provide this evidence. As we argued above, this is largely a result of challenges relating to data and methods. And although our results may appear to contradict the findings of Krueger and Mueller (2016), we argue that they do not: their point estimates are close to ours and we will argue that a decline of the asking wage by 5 percent per year is substantial and not modest. We also contribute to the empirical literature by showing that cross-sectional estimates of the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages are subject to substantial upward bias because exits from the unemployed population are non-random, and that adding the usual controls only partly eliminates this bias.====Second, understanding the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages is important because it provides one channel for the effect of the unemployment rate on wages across the business cycle. The findings of this study are in line with the recent literature that shows that the wages of workers starting in new jobs fall with unemployment duration (Schmieder et al., 2016) and that starting wages are much more cyclical than wages in the overall labor market that are usually characterized by wage stickiness (Pissarides, 2009; Haefke et al., 2013). Even in the presence of downward wage rigidity within jobs and within employment spells, the reservation wage channel opens up a causal pathway from unemployment to the wage bill because the mean unemployment duration is countercyclical. Our results also imply a reinterpretation of earlier findings reported in the literature on starting wages. Schmieder et al. (2016) assume that asking wages are constant over the unemployment spell (they rely on Krueger and Mueller (2016)) and therefor interpret the 0.8 percent per unemployment month fall in starting wages as a duration effect resulting from stigma, human capital depreciation, etcetera. Our estimates suggest that the duration effect on starting wages is smaller than what these authors report.====Third, we report empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of the duration effect on reservation wages with respect to gender and previous wage levels. Inspired by the learning model of Burdett and Vishwanath (1988) and assuming wage dispersion and job seekers who do not know the distribution of their wage offer function, we argue that job seekers infer the wage offer distribution using information about their previous wages (anchoring or reference-dependence) so that workers with high previous wages experience stronger declines in reservation wages as they receive signals about their wage offers during search. We speculate that heterogeneity of the duration effect by gender could result from either gender differences in risk-aversion and self-confidence or gender differences in the relation between unemployment duration and the disutility of being unemployed. We will show that the empirical evidence is more in line with the latter than the former explanation.====The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents theories about the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages in a framework of nonstationary job search models. Section 3 discusses the problem of identification of duration effects and reviews the empirical literature. Section 4 introduces the data and design of our study. Section 5 presents the results and section 6 concludes.

In 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong launched the CR as he believed some leaders within the party were taking China in the wrong (capitalist) direction. Mao called upon Chinese youth to purge the anti-revolutionary elements of the government, the party, and society more generally. In the initial phase, most government leaders and party officials, from the president (Shaoqi Liu) to many factory and village heads, were removed from power.====The Cultural Revolution affected many aspects of contemporary Chinese society. Particularly important were the interruptions to the schooling of as many as 17 birth cohorts. In the first two to three years of the CR (1966–1968), all schools in urban China, including colleges and universities, were closed. Later, primary and junior high schools were gradually reopened. However, senior high school recruitment did not restart until 1972, while merit-based university enrolment did not resume until after the CR in 1977 (Deng, Treiman, 1997, Meng, Gregory, 2002). As a result, cohorts born between 1947 and 1963 (hereafter labelled as the CR cohort) experienced a number of years of schooling interruption and many were denied the chance to obtain a university degree.====A question naturally arises as to whether, and by how much, this large-scale interruption to schooling affected the education level of the next generation.==== High persistence of educational attainment across generations is well established in the literature for many countries. A large number of studies, relying on different strategies, have identified causal intergenerational education links.==== Among these studies, Maurin and McNally (2008) perhaps is the most relevant one to this paper. In that paper they investigated how an event occurred in France in 1968, which led to an abandonment of entrance examinations and a subsequent increase in education level of the relevant birth cohort, affected education level of the children of that birth cohort. They found that not only such a schooling expansion increased education level, occupation, and wages of the parental cohort, but such positive effects were also transmitted to children of the cohort.====For China, studies on the intergenerational transmission of education focus mainly on the average intergenerational educational correlation and its change over time (see, for example, Fan, Yi, Zhang, 2021, Hertz, Jayasundera, Piraino, Selcuk, Smith, Verashchagina, 2007, Magnani, Zhu, 2015).==== In this paper we intend to focus on estimating intergenerational impact of the large scale schooling interruption during the CR.====The interruptions to schooling during the CR can be thought of as a natural experiment, but, unlike other natural experiments in the area of education, schooling interruptions during the CR affected a whole generation of youth (17 birth cohorts) and for as long as one to eight years. An understanding of the intergenerational educational impact of an event of this scale is very important. Recent literature has found that historical shocks at ‘crucial junctures’ often have a long-lasting influence on a country’s economic growth path (see, for example, Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001, Iyer, 2010, Nunn, 2008), and that human capital accumulation is an important channel through which these historical events affect contemporary economic development (see Caicedo, Waldinger, 2012, for example).====Understanding the intergenerational impact of this large-scale schooling interruption can also increase our understanding of the long-lasting impacts of political upheavals in the developing world on long-run economic development through the intergenerational transmission of education. In today’s world, political upheavals, wars, and other conflicts are far from being eradicated. Children in many parts of the world are being denied the chance to go to school because of such adverse shocks. As human capital accumulation is one of the main drivers of economic development, these negative schooling shocks affecting the education levels of the current generation will have an impact far beyond the immediate economic development of these war-torn economies.====In this paper, we first establish the link between the interruption of parents’ schooling during the CR and their children’s educational achievement by estimating a reduced-form model. We find that children whose parents experienced more years of interrupted schooling during the CR complete fewer years of schooling and are less likely to go to university relative to their counterparts whose parents either experienced fewer years of interrupted schooling or were not affected by the CR at all.====We then make attempts to gauge the causal intergenerational impact of this large scale school closure using interrupted schooling as the IV. To do so we consider two potential confounding factors. One is that the schooling closure may also captures other events which occurred to the same city-cohorts cell at the same level. Thus the correlation we found may not be the school closure effect but a combination of many different events. The second is that the interrupted schooling may affect children’s education through other channels rather than parental education.====To understand whether parental schooling interruption in our regression analysis is, in fact, capturing other adverse experiences of parents during the CR, we identify two other likely events during the CR that some or most of the parental cohorts also experienced: the first is the violence that occurred during the initial years of the CR, and the second is the incidence of the Sent-Down Youth (SDY) program, under which some of the CR cohorts were sent as teenagers to work in the countryside for many years. We try to establish that these events are unlikely to have the same degree of variation to the same city-cohort cell as the schooling interruption effect. We also add direct controls to measure the two events in the reduced-form estimation. Our results suggest that controlling for these potential confounding factors does not change the statistically significant negative relationship between parental schooling interruption during the CR and their children’s educational achievement. This supports the view that there is a strong independent parental schooling interruption effect on the education of the next generation.====We then examine the potential channels through which the interrupted schooling of parents may affect children’s years of schooling. In this part of the analysis we use parental human capital-related outcome variables, including parental final education achievement, occupation, income, health, and fertility behaviours, as the dependent variables and examine whether parental schooling interruptions during the CR have an impact on each of these outcome variables. While we find significant correlations between interrupted schooling and final schooling achievement, occupation and income (no effect on health and fertility), it is likely that the correlations to income and occupation are through its impact on parental education. Indeed once controlling for their education achievement, the relationships between parental interrupted schooling and occupation and income become neither economically meaningful nor statistically significant. These results suggest that parental interrupted education impacts children’s education through parental educational achievement but not through the other variables we included.====These insights give us some confidence that perhaps we could use the parental interrupted schooling during the CR as the instrument for parental education and estimate a causal intergenerational impact of the schooling interruption during the CR with 2SLS regression.==== Conditional on our IV satisfy all the assumptions, the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) interpretation of the IV results give us the causal intergenerational impact of the schooling interruption during the CR. This is because the LATE interpretation of our IV result compares the compliers in the treatment group whose parents’ education level was reduced only because of the schooling interruption during the CR and the compliers in the control group whose parents’ education level was not reduced because they did not experience the schooling interruption during the CR. This interpretation of our results may not be considered as the overall intergenerational transmission coefficient for China as a whole.====Using a LATE interpretation of our results, we find that a one-year decrease in parents’ schooling as a result of school interruptions during the CR leads to around a 0.32-year decrease in the child’s schooling and a reduction of 4.1 percentage points in the child’s probability of obtaining a university degree. This is a large effect. Considering that on average for our children’s sample, 22% of people obtained a university degree, the reduction for the children whose parents’ education was cut short because of the schooling interruption reduced by almost a quarter. We also carry out a large number of robustness tests for potential violation of the exclusion restrictions.====The main contribution of this paper is to examine the intergenerational impact of the large scale negative schooling shock during the CR. This contribution is twofold: First, although the existing literature on intergenerational education transmission has identified the causal effect, the literature often focuses on rich countries with limited ==== educational shocks at the lower end of the education distribution (such as the introduction of a compulsory schooling law) (see, for example, Oreopoulos, Page, Stevens, 2006, Piopiunik, 2014). The interruptions to schooling during the Chinese CR enable us to analyse the intergenerational education consequence of a larger-scale schooling shocks (between one and eight years) at the higher end of the education distribution (by preventing people from obtaining senior high school, college, or university degrees) relative to existing literature. Second, unlike the examples in the existing literature, the schooling interruption during the CR affected education ====, while compulsory schooling laws studied in the literature examines ==== shocks. To the extent that education shocks may have asymmetric impacts, that is the effect for a given level of increase in education may differ from the same level of decrease, it is of great importance to observe the magnitude of the impact of these negative shocks, which are more in line with the experience of today’s developing world. A potential reason for asymmetrical impact could be related to the psychologists finding that negative shocks often have stronger impact on people’s behaviour than positive shocks (see, for example, Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, Vohs, 2001, Corns, 2018).====The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes how the Chinese Cultural Revolution affected the educational attainment of certain birth cohorts, and describes two other relevant historical events that were part of the CR experience of the parental cohorts. Section 3 discusses the data. Section 4 investigates the reduced form relationship and tests for potential confounding factors. Section 5 examines the channels through which parental schooling interruption during the CR may affect children’s educational achievement and Section 6 presents the 2SLS results and robustness tests.

This new series shows that 7.8 percent of persons in the U.S. are multiple jobholders, this percentage is pro-cyclical, and has been trending upward during the past several decades. The data also show that earnings from secondary jobs are, on average, 27.8 percent of a multiple jobholder's total quarterly earnings. Multiple jobholding occurs at all levels of earnings, with both higher- and lower-earnings multiple jobholders earning more than 25 percent of their total earnings from multiple jobs. In a ","There are unanswered questions about individuals who are increasingly stringing together multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. Although these discussions often refer to the growing gig economy, they also refer to individuals holding two or more wage and salary jobs. Knowing the level and trend of multiple jobholding, as well as the characteristics and earnings of multiple johbolders, is important to economists and policymakers.====The dominant source of data for research and published information on multiple jobholders in the United States is the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is the nation's premier representative survey of households, providing monthly labor market statistics. Widely cited statistics from the CPS show that the multiple jobholding rate in the U.S has been declining during the past several decades. Yet several recent studies have suggested that multiple jobholding is underreported in the CPS, and this underreporting may be getting worse over time.====In this article, we propose a new data source for research and analyses about multiple jobholding – the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). The LEHD are administrative data that nearly encompass the population of workers. The use of LEHD administrative data is both a uniquely-defining characteristic of our research and a significant advantage in quantifying and analyzing multiple jobholding in the U.S. In addition to the large sample size, two additional characteristics of LEHD data are: 1) LEHD combines demographic data from various sources to develop workforce information by characteristics such as gender and age, and 2) LEHD has earnings information for each job that an individual holds.====The reference period of the LEHD data is a calendar quarter. As such, the first step in our research is to define multiple jobholding based upon the available information in the quarterly administrative data. We define a multiple jobholder as an individual who holds two or more jobs in a quarter and at least one of the jobs is a long-lasting stable job.====We find that over the 1996:Q2 – 2018:Q1 time period, the LEHD multiple jobholding rate averages 7.2 percent of all employed individuals. This multiple jobholding rate has been rising during the past several decades, from 6.8 percent in 1996:Q2 to 7.8 percent in 2018:Q1. The LEHD multiple jobholding rate is cyclical, declining in both the 2001 and the 2007-2009 recessions. These patterns are different from those measured by the CPS: the CPS multiple jobholding rate is much lower in magnitude, and the CPS multiple jobholding rate is declining over the past several decades with no evidence of cyclicality. The rising trend of multiple jobholding in the LEHD, in contrast to the declining trend in the CPS, suggests that multiple jobholding is becoming more important in the U.S. economy than previously known.====We introduce a data generating process (DGP) to understand the differences between the LEHD and the CPS multiple jobholding rates. We model the different definitions, the different coverages, the different reference periods (time aggregation), and differences in reporting behavior that exist between the LEHD and the CPS. This model of the DGP indicates that short duration jobs that are missed by the CPS's one-week reference period are more important than definition and coverage differences, and this model suggests that increasing survey misreporting in the CPS plays an important role.====The LEHD has earnings information for all jobs, rather than just the primary job as in the CPS. We document that earnings from all secondary jobs are, on average, 27.8 percent of a multiple jobholder's total quarterly earnings. This 27.8 percent is essentially constant over time with little if any evidence of cyclicality. We also document that the multiple jobholding rate exhibits an inverted-U shape across the range of total full-quarter earnings, and at every percentile of total earnings, multiple jobholding provides on average more than 25 percent of total earnings for individuals who are multiple jobholders. In a regression analysis that controls for age, gender, and industry, multiple jobholders earn more at all jobs than do non-multiple jobholders.====The roadmap of this paper is as follows. We begin with a literature review of multiple jobholding. In section three, we discuss how to define multiple jobholding from quarterly administrative data that does not contain information on hours worked or weeks worked during the quarter. We provide a thorough description of the data in section four. In section five, we quantify the 7.2 percent average LEHD multiple jobholding rate, and we document the trend and cyclicality of the LEHD multiple jobholding measure. We compare the LEHD multiple jobholding measure to the CPS multiple jobholding measure in section six. We present gender and age data, industry data, and duration data in section seven. Section eight looks at earnings, including both simple tabulations and a regression analysis.

We found that older age particularly signals to recruiters that the applicant has lower technological skills, flexibility, and trainability levels. Together, these perceptions explain about 41% of the effect of age on the probability of being invited to a job interview. Additionally, we found that the negative association between age and the invitation to interview probability is smaller when recruiters work for firms with a higher percentage of older employees.","The financing of Pay-As-You-Go pension systems, where labour income taxes paid by the working population are used to finance the pensions of the retired population, has become a major problem for many OECD countries (Barr, 2006; Attanasio, Kitao, & Violante, 2007; McGrattan & Prescott, 2017). That is, the increase in life expectancy (Attanasio et al., 2007; Kontis, Bennett, Mathers, Foreman, & Ezzati, 2017; OECD, 2019b), and decrease in fertility to below the replacement level (Attanasio et al., 2007; OECD, 2019b) has led to rising dependency ratios. The most commonly suggested solution for this financing problem is to make people work longer (Breyer & Kifmann, 2002; Munnell & Sass, 2009; Maestas & Zissimopoulos, 2010; Harkin, 2012; Kitao, 2014). When comparing the employment rate of individuals over 55 with those aged 25–54 in various developed countries, there is still a significant margin for improvement in this respect. In the United States, for example, 63.5% of the population aged 55–64 and 33.0% of the population aged 65 to 69 was employed in 2018, which is remarkably less than the 79.9% employment rate for the population aged 25–54 (OECD, 2019a).====In practice, however, raising the employment rate of people aged 55 and over is not that straightforward. There are various explanations for the lower employment rates of people over 55, one of which is age discrimination in hiring (Boissonneault et al., 2020). Using correspondence field experiments, previous research has found considerable evidence of age discrimination in hiring in the United States (Johnson & Neumark, 1997; Lahey, 2008; Farber, Silverman, & von Wachter, 2016; Neumark, Burn, & Button, 2016, 2019; Neumark, Burn, Button, & Chehras, 2019; Neumark, 2018), the United Kingdom (Riach & Rich, 2010; Tinsley, 2012; Riach, 2015; Drydakis, MacDonald, Bozani, & Chiotis, 2017), and the European Union (Ahmed, Andersson, & Hammarstedt 2012; Riach, 2015; Baert, Norga, Thuy, & Van Hecke, 2016; Carlsson & Eriksson, 2019).==== ==== Hiring discrimination pushes older individuals, especially those who are unemployed (Deelen, de Graaf-Zijl, & van den Berge, 2018) or unsatisfied with their current job (Scharn, Sewdas, Boot, Huisman, Lindeboom, & Van Der Beek, 2018) out of the labour market, forcing many to claim retirement benefits before full retirement age. To induce and enable people to work longer, it is, therefore, crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying age discrimination and craft policies to relax them.====In the economic literature, two main theoretical models provide explanations as to why employers may discriminate against older workers when hiring new employees: Arrow's (1973) model of statistical discrimination and Becker's (1957) model of taste-based discrimination. The model of statistical discrimination posits that age discrimination in the hiring process is driven by stereotypes concerning older workers’ productivity (Arrow, 1973). When making hiring decisions, recruiters often have a limited amount of information about a job applicant, such as their age, gender, education level, and work experience. As a result, they might use this limited information as a signal for other, unobserved characteristics concerning the applicant's productivity (Arrow, 1973; Spence, 1973; Vishwanath, 1989; Blanchard & Diamond, 1994; Moscarini, 1997; Kroft, Lange, & Notowidigo, 2013; Eriksson & Rooth, 2014). Following this theory, older applicants might not be hired because older age signals, for example, lower levels of physical ability (Schmidt & Boland, 1986; Hummert, Garstka, Shaner, & Strahm, 1994; Finkelstein, Burke, & Raju, 1995; Kroon et al., 2018) or flexibility (Warr & Pennington, 1993; AARP 2000; Büsch, Dahl, & Dittrich, 2009; McCann & Keaton, 2013).==== On the other hand, the taste-based discrimination model indicates that employers discriminate against older job applicants because they, their employees, or their customers might experience a decrease in utility when interacting with older workers (Becker, 1957).==== ====Although some of the correspondence studies mentioned above also tried to test these models empirically (e.g., Baert et al., 2016; Drydakis et al., 2017; Lahey, 2008; Neumark, Burn, & Button, 2016), the results of these studies concerning the explanations for age discrimination in hiring are often inconclusive. While correspondence field experiments are a great tool to measure hiring discrimination convincingly, the method is less suitable to gain insights into the causes of this discrimination. In recent years, however, researchers have used alternative ways to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of age discrimination in hiring. In particular, Richardson, Webb, Webber, and Smith (2013) use a lab experiment to test which stereotypes predict discrimination. More concretely, they design a vignette experiment in which participants evaluate fictitious job applicants, of whom age is varied, for a hypothetical job vacancy. The authors examine whether a fictitious applicant's age affects perceptions about their reliability, sociability, trainability, and intellectual competence and to which extent these perceptions play a mediating role in the hiring decisions of the participants. They find that, although an applicant's age negatively affects evaluations of her or his trainability and sociability, the effect of the applicant's age on hiring evaluations was not mediated by these work-related competencies. Additionally, Burn, Button, Corella, and Neumark (2019) experimentally test whether the ageist language in job ads is correlated with hiring discrimination. These authors find that language related to ageist stereotypes is over-represented in the phrases selected by machine learning algorithms as predicting discrimination. Older workers are more likely to be discriminated against when job ads use sentences related to physical ability, technology, or communication skills.====Evidence of stereotypes’ effect on the hiring of older workers can also be found in survey research. Both Taylor and Walker (1998), Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), and Jensen, De Tavernier and Nielsen (2019) surveyed employers, respectively in the UK, Sweden, and Denmark, regarding their perceptions of older workers and different workplace practices, among which recruitment practices. Where both Taylor and Walker (1998) and Carlsson and Eriksson (2019) found an association between different perceptions of older workers (e.g., concerning their trainability) and recruitment practices, Jensen et al. (2019) did not. Furthermore, Turek and Henkens (Turek and Henkens, 2020) used employer surveys from Poland to assess how likely employers are to recruit people over 50 years old and studied how the probability of inviting an older candidate to an interview varied as the skill requirements of the job post changed. These authors observed that older candidates were less likely to be hired in jobs requiring computer-, physical-, social-, creative-, and training skills.====In the present article, we contribute to this literature by using a state-of-the-art vignette experiment in line with Richardson et al. (2013). In our experiment, we show participants with genuine hiring experience a series of fictitious résumés, varying over the applicants' age, gender, and some other attributes, which they had to evaluate for a hypothetical vacancy. The participants had to assess these fictitious profiles concerning various characteristics related to the productivity-related stigma identified in Burn et al.'s (2019) literature review and potential negative attitudes towards collaborating with older employees in line with the theory of taste-based discrimination. Consequentially, our design enables us to identify employer perceptions and attitudes towards older job candidates and to explore the degree to which these perceptions and attitudes act as drivers of potential age discrimination. We randomly assigned subjects to review applicants for one of eight job vacancies varying along four different dimensions, i.e., the required degree of skills, the level of customer contact, the required amount of physical effort, and the required level of technological knowledge associated with the job, allowing us to investigate the heterogeneity in unequal treatment of older job applicants by these four dimensions. Furthermore, we surveyed our participants concerning their background characteristics to identify the possible moderating effects of these characteristics on age discrimination in hiring (e.g., participants' age and the percentage of older workers employed by their companies).====This study improves on the previous literature in four meaningful ways. First, we investigate a more systematic and extensive set of explanations for age discrimination in hiring compared to previous research (i.e., all factors identified by the existing theoretical and survey-based literature). While former contributions restricted their attention to a limited set of stereotypes (e.g., Richardson et al. (2013) and the studies based on employer surveys, mentioned before), our research takes into account (almost) all stereotypes identified by Burn et al. (2019) in their literature review. Additionally, while none of the former contributions investigates (nor controls for) taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957), we consider employers’, customers’, and employees’ potential negative attitudes towards collaborating with older employees as an alternative explanation for age-based discrimination in hiring. Second, we also use a more systematic method (i.e., a vignette experiment and a thorough mediation analysis) to analyse the relative importance of these factors compared to most existing studies (except for Richardson et al. (2013)). Third, in our study, we account for many more of the pathways through which individual characteristics and job characteristics interact with age. The vignette experiment used by Richardson et al. (2013) and the surveys by Taylor and Walker (1998), Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), and Turek and Henkens (2019) only questioned employers about a limited number of characteristics involving the job (in the case of Taylor and Walker (1998) and Turek and Henkens (2019)) or the individual participants (in the case of Taylor and Walker (1998), Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), and Richardson et al. (2013)) as moderators of age discrimination. Lastly, our vignette study is an improvement over Richardson et al. (2013) in terms of scale and external validity. Our study features 2000 candidate evaluations (a much larger sample than that employed by Richardson et al. (2013)), studies both men and women (whereas Richardson et al. (2013) only used male applicants), considers several different types of job vacancies (Richardson et al. (2013) used only a position in the IT industry), and studies the behaviour of actual human resource managers (while Richardson et al. (2013) mainly worked with students).==== ==== Taken together, these improvements provide scholars and policymakers with more general insights into the mechanisms underlying age discrimination (as well as its moderators).",What Does a Job Candidate's Age Signal to Employers?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000385,24 May 2021,2021,Research Article,195.0

Using a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression coupled with the National ==== of Youth 1997 data, I estimate how Off-JT certificate completion impacts employment and real (2014) annual income. Among those with a college degree, there is a significant increase in annual income. The total effect when individual-specific linear time trends are included ranges from $4,803.6 to $5,844.7. In contrast, for those with less than a college degree there is no significant change in income, despite a significant increase in employment. This is likely due to the small impact on hours worked for those without a college degree (an increase of 27 hours over the year, on average). The results suggest that the recent returns to Off-JT certificate completion depend on the formal level of education acquired prior to Off-JT.","Post-schooling off-the-job training (Off-JT) is common and can result in a certificate upon completion.==== These shorter-term programs are of interest because the number of certificates awarded has increased by over 800 percent over the last thirty years (Carnevale, Rose and Hanson (2012)). However, previous Off-JT literature uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 cohort, see for example Lynch (1991), Lynch (1992), Veum (1995) and Veum (1997). It is important to estimate more recent benefits to Off-JT, especially given that Marcotte (2019) finds that the economic returns to community college education (one type of Off-JT) have grown over time.====This paper contributes to the literature by estimating recent returns to Off-JT across levels of formal education. This is important because the National Center for Education Statistics (2016) reports that among those enrolled in a sub-baccalaureate certificate program in 2011–2012, 34 percent already had a post-secondary credential. Also, Cataldi et al. (2017) report that among 2007–2008 bachelor’s degree recipients, 16 percent had their highest post-baccalaureate enrollment in an undergraduate certificate program and 14 percent had their highest post-baccalaureate enrollment in a post-baccalaureate certificate program. Both programs were reported to be more common than a doctoral degree program or completing an additional bachelor’s degree. Thus, certificate programs are not exclusively enrolled in by those with only a high school degree.====Bailey and Belfield (2017) note that scant research has been done on the labor market benefits of stacked credentials (certificates and degrees), despite recent excitement over the possibility that they could help solve numerous problems associated with training a modern workforce. They note that stacked credentials played a central role in the $2 billion Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grants Program started by the Obama Administration. An exception that focuses on stacking a post-baccalaureate certificate on top of a bachelor’s degree is Gaulke et al. (2019), which uses a correspondence study to measure the impact on callback rates from a post-baccalaureate business certificate. There is no evidence that having the certificate significantly increases the callback rate. Another exception is the recent working paper by Meyer et al. (2020), which uses a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression and data from Virginia to estimate effects of stacking among adults who already hold one community college credential. They find that stacking increases employment (four percentage points) and increases quarterly earnings by $570 or seven percent.====More recent research estimates the returns to certificates from specific types of Off-JT programs using administrative data. For example, Jepsen et al. (2014) find certificates from community colleges in Kentucky increase employment for women, and there are positive wage impacts for both men and women. Stevens et al. (2018) use data from career technical education programs in California to find that certificates increase wages by around 14 percent, and the gains are larger among health fields. Carruthers and Sanford (2018) estimate that students who complete a diploma (longer certificate program) at a state technical center in Tennessee experience increases in earnings, but the returns to terminal certificates are smaller and less economically meaningful. Cellini and Turner (2018) use administrative data to find smaller benefits to certificates from for-profit schools than public schools, while Lang and Weinstein (2013) find no significant difference between for-profit and community college certificates using transcript data and survey data.====While there are clear benefits to using administrative data in terms of sample size and avoiding missing data, there is a downside as well. Specifically, these data do not include information about other types of training that people may be receiving and more detailed information about prior educational experiences. Thus, by using the detailed training data available from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97), this paper adds to the literature by estimating recent returns to Off-JT certificates across levels of formal education while controlling for other types of training, albeit with a smaller sample and some missing income data.====I use a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression to estimate impacts on employment and income as is standard in the related literature (for example, see Jacobson, Jacobson et al. (2005), Carruthers and Sanford (2018), Dynarski et al. (2018), and Stevens et al. (2018)). This method includes both individual fixed-effects and individual-specific linear time trends, which is the recommendation in Dynarski, Jacob and Kreisman (2018). The model separately controls for enrollment and completion. This is important because the related literature has shown there are returns from completing credits, even in the absence of program completion (see Belfield and Bailey (2017) for an overview of this literature).====I find that formal level of education matters for the impact of Off-JT certificate completion by allowing for a main effect of certificate completion, and an interaction term for degree completion prior to Off-JT and certificate completion. For those without a college degree there is a significant and positive impact on employment, regardless of controls for other types of training. However, this does not translate to a significant and positive income premium, likely due to small impacts on annual hours worked. For those with a college degree, I cannot rule out the employment effect is different from those without a college degree. The income premium for certificate interacted with degree completion is positive and significant, and the total impact is also positive and significant for degree completers. This result is robust regardless of whether controls for other types of training are included. This increase in income is partly due to an increase in hours worked among degree completers. While the estimated impact on hours worked is quite similar regardless of whether controls for other training are included or not, the coefficient slightly decreases in magnitude and becomes only marginally significant once the other training controls are included.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes some background information on Off-JT and certificates. Section 3 describes the NLSY97 data and the sample selection. Section 4 describes the fixed-effects difference-in-differences method. Section 5 presents and discusses the results on employment, income, and hours worked.

We run a field experiment to analyze whether in an incentivized setting men and women show differences in their willingness to speak in public. The experiment involved more than 500 undergraduates who could gain two points to add to the final grade of their exam by presenting solutions to a set problem orally. Students were randomly assigned to give a presentation to the instructor only or in front of a large audience (a class of 100 or more). We find that while women are more willing to do a face-to-face presentation, they are considerably less likely to give a public presentation. We show that female aversion to public speaking does not depend on differences in ability or other psychological attitudes. Such an aversion seems considerably less marked for daughters of working women. The aversion to public speaking cannot be interpreted as strategic avoidance deriving from women anticipating their poor performance in this specific task. From survey data we also show that neither increasing the gains deriving from public speaking nor allowing participants more time to prepare lessens the gender gap.","Over the last 15 years an impressive number of works has been devoted to highlighting the role played by psychological attitudes in explaining gender gaps in labor market outcomes and women's underrepresentation in the top tiers of the earnings distribution. A robust body of evidence shows that females are more averse to risk and less willing to compete, have a lower degree of self-confidence, tend to face difficulties in negotiations, suffer more under pressure and from receiving negative feedbacks. However, other psychological traits might also play a role. For instance, Alan at al. (2020) show that women's tendency to avoid tasks to be accomplished under public scrutiny is key in explaining gender differences in leadership propensity.====With reference to this finding, we focus in this paper on attitudes toward public speaking. The ability to speak competently in public is essential to work in team and to lead, organize, motivate people and this task seems an important prerequisite for many high-profile careers. For instance, Bandiera et al., (2011) show that managers spend most of their working time talking with/to others (meetings take up 60% of their working hours), suggesting that public speaking might be a key element of highly skilled jobs. On the other hand, public speaking is often considered as an anxiety-generating factor that can negatively impact on personal, academic and professional achievement (Marinho et al., 2017). In lab experiments speaking in front of others is commonly used as an intervention aimed at causing stress (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). The most frequent outcome resulting from public speech anxiety is avoidance of speaking situations (McCroskey, 1997), which sequentially can limit one's involvement and effectiveness in educational pursuits, career opportunities, and community activities (Daly et al., 1997).====To investigate the determinants of public speaking aversion in an incentivized framework, we run a field experiment involving more than 500 students enrolled at an Italian University. The students involved were given the possibility to gain two points to add to the final grade of the exam by solving at home a number of exercises/questions, submitting the solutions to the instructor and accepting to present them orally, either in front of the whole class or at the instructor during office hours. Students were randomly assigned in advance to the group “Presentation to the Class” or to the group “Presentation to the Instructor”. Students had two weeks to decide whether to participate in the proposed task, by submitting their solutions to the problem set. Due to time constraints, we announced that only one third (randomly selected) of participants were required to present their homework.====We find that while women are more willing to present face-to-face to the instructor (on average 43% of women), they are considerably less likely to give a public presentation (25%), that is, their willingness to present decreases by 18 percentage points if assigned to the public speaking treatment. In contrast, men tend to participate less compared to women in face-to-face presentation (39% instead of 43%), but there is almost no difference in their willingness to participate if they are assigned to the public presentation (38%).====We investigate a number of possible mechanisms. Firstly, we show that public speaking propensity is not captured by other psychological traits, such as risk aversion, self-confidence and self-esteem. We also find that the tendency to shy away from public speaking is also common among women otherwise characterized by high levels of self-confidence and self-esteem. Secondly, consistently with the growing literature stressing the association between female labor market participation and more egalitarian gender attitudes among their children,==== we find that women raised by working mothers are less averse to public speaking.====Importantly, our main findings do not seem to be driven by strategic avoidance deriving from women rationally choosing not to present in public because they expect to do badly. To support this claim, we firstly show that students randomly selected for the public presentation do not perform worse than their male counterparts. Then, in order to overcome selection problems, we provide additional evidence that exploit a change in the examination system due to the Covid-19 health emergency in which all the students were required to give an oral presentation in front of an audience: we find that no gender differences emerge in public speaking performance.====Finally, to understand how individuals react to incentives and time availability/constraints, we have combined our experimental evidence with an on-line survey conducted on a sample of students not involved in the experiment. We find that students are willing to give a public presentation for a reward that is twice of that corresponding to the face-to-face presentation. The required reward is greater for females but the gender gap does not close when rewards for public speaking become higher. In addition, we find that men's propensity to give a public presentation increases more than women's when they are given more time available to prepare for it.====This paper contributes to the existing research on gender differences in psychological attitudes (Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014; Bertrand, 2011; Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Niederle, 2015) in that it focuses on public speaking propensity, an aspect which has been overlooked to date. Some economic papers have studied how individuals react to public scrutiny (Alan et al. 2020; Ariely et al., 2009; Battiston et al., 2018) and whether they tend to avoid such types of situation, but, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that focuses specifically on speaking in front of an audience. In addition, whereas much existing work on public speaking aversion relies on self-reported measures, or deals with self-selected samples or is unable to control for some important determinants of public speaking propensity (for example, individual ability), our design introduces an exogenous variation that allows us to clearly identify gender differences in public speaking propensity and provides evidence on the determinants of public speaking aversion in an incentivized framework, controlling for quite a large set of cognitive and non-cognitive individual skills.====Finally, our work relying both on an incentivized and a survey measure of public speaking attitudes adds to a number of papers seeking to understand how survey and experimental measures of psychological traits correlate (see for instance, Dohmen et al., 2011; Goldback and Schluter, 2018). In line with these works, our results demonstrate that a simple survey question can capture effective public speaking aversion.====The results of the present analysis have important policy implications in that they shed light on gender differences in a psychological trait – aversion to public speaking – that is likely crucial for personal and professional success but has been scarcely investigated until now. As this trait, such as other psychological traits, might be the result of nurture rather than nature, a number of policies can be adopted to help women feel more comfortable in public speaking situations.====The paper is organized as follows. The related literature is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the design of the experiment. Section 4 presents the data and reports some balance checks. Our main results are shown in Section 5. In Section 6 we investigate a number of possible mechanisms. Section 7 discusses whether women strategically avoid public speaking situations.

We document a dramatic increase in the demand for AI skills over 2010–2019 in the U.S. economy across most ==== and occupations. The demand is highest in IT occupations, followed by architecture and engineering, scientific, and management occupations. Firms with larger market capitalization, higher cash holdings, and higher investments in R&D have a higher demand for AI skills. We also document a wage premium of 11% for job postings that require AI skills within the same firm and 5% within the same job title. Managerial occupations have the highest wage premium for AI skills. Firms demanding AI skills more intensively also offer higher salaries in non-AI jobs.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is possibly the most promising technology currently in development which has potential applications across a wide range of industries and functions. While it offers the possibility to increase productivity and create new jobs, it may also replace humans to reduce costs (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019) and potentially lead to lower labor share, increased inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018b), and disruptions in many industries (Mateos-Garcia, 2019). Hence, its impact is a matter of immense interest to both economists and policymakers – especially in economies with declining productivity growth and shrinking working-age populations. Still, little in known about the level of adoption of AI technology across firms, its penetration within occupations, and its impact in the labor market.====In this paper, we start by providing some key facts on the demand for AI skills in the United States across occupations and industries and show how it has evolved over the last decade. Most interestingly, we examine which firm characteristics predict the demand for AI skills to give a sense of the types of firms that may have adopted AI earlier. Finally, we estimate a wage premium for AI skills and analyse how wages and skills in other jobs change when the firm demands AI-skilled labor.====Indeed, the extent to which firms use AI remains a black box. The firm-level adoption of AI is hard to estimate since it would require a specific knowledge on the type of technology the firm uses in the production function. However, because the application of AI technology by firms requires a highly-specialized human capital (Gofman and Jin, 2020), the demand for labor with AI skills can proxy for the use of AI technology. Based on this insight, our approach is to track the demand for AI skills using data on the online job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) which contain nearly a universe of online job postings since 2010.====BGT provides us with detailed information on the skill set of each vacancy and a broad range of other details about the job and the employer.==== AI vacancies are identified using a list of skills that are directly associated with the knowledge of AI technology or the ability to use AI-related software, such as ”artificial intelligence”, ”machine vision”, ”deep learning” or ”speech recognition”. Thus, an “AI vacancy” is a vacancy that requires at least one AI-related skill from this list. Our main measure of the demand for AI skills is the ratio of AI job postings over the total number of job postings. The unique qualities of the BGT data allow us to follow the demand for AI skills across industries, occupations, firms, and even job titles.====First, we document a fast growth in the demand for AI skills over time. We show that the demand for AI skills grew 4 times over the period from 2010 to 2019. Firms are striving to hire more employees with AI-related skills, especially in the last three years, and the demand is still gaining momentum. As expected, the demand for AI skills is highest in the Information sector, but it is also high in Professional Services, Administrative and Support Services, and Finance sectors. Among occupations, Computer and Mathematical occupations present the highest intensity of the demand for AI skills, followed by Architecture and Engineering and Science occupations. In sum, the data shows that the demand for AI skills has been growing fast across a wide range of sectors and occupations – it is not limited to the IT-related industries and jobs.====Second, we explore which firm characteristics explain the demand for AI skills and find that large firms with high cash holdings and high R&D investments on average demand AI skills in their vacancies more. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple theoretical framework that examines which firm-level characteristics predict the automation with the use of AI algorithms, and consequently the demand for AI skills. We develop this framework by extending the task-based model of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a). In our framework, firms differ in terms of size, productivity, and the fixed cost of automation, and thus will tend to automate with AI differently. Specifically, the framework predicts that large scale firms will have a higher demand for AI-skilled labor, while firms facing higher fixed costs of automation will demand less AI skills.====Next, we move on to exploring the variation in pay across vacancies and estimate the wage premium associated with AI skills. Job postings demanding AI skills do offer an 11% premium within the same firm and a 5% premium within the same job title. We explore how the premium differs across industries and occupations. As expected from the fast growing demand for AI skills in Computer and Mathematical jobs, there is a substantial wage premium for AI skills in these vacancies. Indeed, AI is a valuable IT-related skill. But to our surprise, we find that the premium for AI skills is the highest for Management occupations, suggesting that in these jobs AI skills carry even more value for employers. This evidence of an especially high premium for AI skills in Management jobs highlights that the AI’s value may rest in its combination with a broader organizational change.====Finally, we explore whether firms demanding AI-skilled labor show evidence of changing demand for other, non-AI, jobs in terms of wages and skill requirements. We find that firms demanding AI skills more intensively tend to offer higher salaries in their non-AI vacancies. This evidence is consistent with a view that AI technology can facilitate the demand for high-skilled jobs complementing it. To further explore how non-AI jobs change with the rise in the demand for AI, we examine which skill groups go hand-in-hand with AI skills in the firm. We find that jobs that require Software, Cognitive, Social, Project Management, and People Management skills are complementary to AI jobs, while jobs requiring Customer Service skills show evidence of being substituted by AI.====The results presented in the paper provide one of the first aggregate pieces of evidence on the diffusion of AI technology in the United States. Overall, our findings on the pervasiveness of the demand for AI-skilled labor across industries and occupations suggest that AI is likely to be a driver of significant transformations in the labor market over the next decades. These results can inform policymakers deciding on future education and labor market policies as well as workers deciding about investing in their human capital that is necessary to fit the profile of the employee of the future.====The paper aims to contribute to the literature analysing the effect of new technologies on labor market outcomes. Our primary contribution is to the recent empirical literature analysing the effect of AI technology on labor. Felten et al. (2019) find that occupations impacted by advances in AI experience a small positive change in wages, and no change in employment. Using the job vacancies data, Acemoglu et al. (2020) show that AI changes the composition of occupations in firms, but there is no evidence of a massive job destruction due to AI. Alderucci et al. (2020) document that the number of firm’s AI-related patents is positively related to the firm’s employment growth rate, but also is positively associated with the within-firm wage inequality. We complement this literature by providing evidence on the wage premium for AI skills and on how the intensity of the demand for AI skills is related to the average wages and skills required in non-AI vacancies. Brynjolfsson et al. (2018), Felten et al. (2019), and Webb (2019) build indices showing the impact of developments in AI technology on the occupations’ task content. The authors are able to identify jobs in which tasks will be most and least affected by AI. These indices are useful to classify jobs that are more or less likely to be transformed and replaced by AI technology. We complement this literature by documenting the extent of the actual demand for AI-skilled labor across firms, industries, and occupations.====We also complement the research on the effect of technology on labor by providing a simple theoretical framework helping to understand which firms are more likely to automate with AI and thus more likely to demand AI skills in their vacancies. In this, we build on the task-based framework of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b). The authors provide a model that shows how machines can have a dual effect on labor markets. On the one hand, machines can replace human labor in some tasks and thus reduce labor share, employment, and wages; on the other hand, they can promote the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage and may counteract the replacement effect. This framework with a specific application to AI is used in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a). Other relevant conceptual work on labor displacement as the result of automation includes Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Benzell et al. (2015).====This paper also contributes to a recent but fast-growing stream of literature that documents the diffusion of AI technology (Acemoglu, Autor, Hazell, Restrepo, 2020, Blair, Deming, 2020, Goldfarb, Taska, Teodoridis, 2019, Goldfarb, Taska, Teodoridis, 2020). Our descriptive evidence on the demand for AI skills is close to the findings in the paper of Goldfarb et al. (2019) that documents how widespread AI skills are in job postings across industries and occupations. However, our analysis differs substantially from this research. The authors’ primary focus lies in comparing AI with a few other new technologies and on identifying whether AI has features of a general-purpose technology (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). Also, the authors abstract from studying the predictors of the AI adoption or the effects that the demand for AI labor has on other jobs, while our paper addresses these questions. Our descriptive evidence is also consistent with a supplementary part of the analysis in Blair and Deming (2020) that shows an increase in the demand for machine learning skills in job postings. However, their research focuses on the jobs’ upskilling after the Great Recession, and hence we do not intersect in the rest of the analysis. Also, Acemoglu et al. (2020) show a descriptive evidence on the growth of the share of AI vacancies across industry sectors and across geographies. Their analysis beyond the descriptive part, however, has a different focus than ours and we consider our findings highly complementary. The authors show that firms demanding AI skills change the composition of occupations within the firms by hiring less for jobs at risk of replacement by AI. At the same time, we provide evidence on the wage effects and skills requirements in non-AI jobs in firms demanding AI specialists.====Finally, we contribute to the research analysing the evolution in the demand for various skills and premium for skills. We used papers of Deming and Kahn (2018) and Deming and Noray (2019) to define 10 non-AI skills for which we control in our regressions. We contribute to this literature by comparing the premium for AI skills vis-as-vis premia for other skills and by documenting complementarities between AI and non-AI skills.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data and sample and outlines the procedure we use to estimate the demand for AI skills. Section 3 presents the descriptive analysis on the demand for AI skills in the overall U.S. economy and across industries and occupations. It also shows which firm characteristics predict the demand for AI skills. Section 4 analyses the wage premium for AI skills. Section 5 presents evidence on the effect of the firm-level demand for AI skills on non-AI vacancies.

A significant gap remains even after controlling for very precisely measured skills. Longer careers of men in the sector explain around half of the wage gap, with the other half due in roughly equal parts to differences in internal and across-factory ==== rates. Our results are most consistent with broader gender norms, beyond gendered household responsibilities, driving the gap.","A bourgeoning literature seeks to determine the underlying causes of gender pay gaps (Blau and Khan, 2017). The explanations of the gaps can be broadly classified into three strands. First, different preferences of women and men may lead them to make different job choices, or to behave differently on the job (Azmat, Ferrer, 2017, Cook, Diamond, List, Oyer, Flory, Leibbrandt, List, 2015). Second, women may be subject to greater constraints on their choices of, or flexibility within, jobs, due to, for example, household and family constraints or social norms (Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010, Black, 1995, Card, Cardoso, Kline, 2016, Corcoran, Courant, Noonan, 2005, Goldin, 2014, Hardy, Kagy, 2020, Manning, 2013). Third, the gaps may reflect outright discrimination (Boring, 2017, Card, DellaVigna, Funk, Iriberri, 2020, Egan, Matvos, Seru, 2017, Goldin, Rouse, 2000, Hengel, 2018, MacNell, Driscoll, Hunt, 2015, Mengel, Sauermann, Zölitz, 2018, Sarsons, 2017, Sarsons, 2019).====However, most of the literature on gender pay gaps is based on data from high-income countries. Evidence from developing countries is much sparser. This owes in large part to the lack of high-quality data in developing countries. Nevertheless, we may expect gender wage gaps to be as prevalent in developing countries. Indeed, many of the related potential drivers, such as norms, preferences and expectations, are even more pronounced in many developing countries (Duflo, 2012, Giuliano, 2018, Jayachandran, 2015, Jayachandran, 2019, World Bank, 2012).====We address the data issue by using administrative records for more than 80,000 workers from 70 large garment export factories in Bangladesh. The salary data come from electronic wage records of the factories, and have several advantages over more widely available labor survey data. First, our administrative data identify the worker’s precise occupation in the factory, and record wages as well as overall income. The administrative data are also likely more precise than data reported in labor surveys.==== Moreover, for a subset of workers, we have very detailed skills assessments that allow us to measure wages conditional on skills. Finally, our sample of more than 80,000 workers from a single sector is much larger than is typical for labor force surveys.====We analyze the gender wage gap in the Bangladeshi readymade garment (RMG) sector, a sector of central importance for development. Garment export sectors are a catalyst for both women’s participation in the wage labor market and for sustained export-led growth in low-income countries (Gereffi, 1999). In Bangladesh, the sector employs more than four million workers, around half of whom are women (Farole et al., 2017).==== Even now, among women with less than university education who work in full-time wage jobs, 40 percent are employed in the garment sector (Bangladeshi Labor Force Survey (LFS), 2017). Employment opportunities in the sector have resulted in higher educational attainment and delayed marriage for young women in Bangladesh (Heath and Mobarak, 2015). Given the RMG sector’s role as the most important gateway for women into formal employment in many low-income countries, our data from Bangladesh provide an important case study of gender wage gaps in a setting representing the early stages of a typical export-led growth process.====In Figure 1, we use data from the 2017 LFS to compare the wage gap in the RMG sector to other sectors of the Bangladeshi economy. The LFS data show that women employed in the RMG sector earn 10.5 percent less than their male counterparts, controlling for quadratics in education and age. Figure 1 orders 11 sectors with significant female participation by the size of the gender wage gap. There are seven sectors, employing 25 percent of women working full time in these 11 sectors, with smaller gaps, and three sectors, employing 32 percent of these women, with larger gaps. Thus, the wage gap in the RMG sector represents roughly the median gap women face in the country’s economy.====Turning to the more precise administrative data from our 70 factories, we find an overall wage gap of around 20 percent in these factories, more than half of which is explained by the overwhelming predominance of males in management roles. When we focus on non-supervisory shop-floor workers, positions where women are well represented, the gap falls to 8 percent. To disentangle the drivers of this wage gap, we use unusually precise skills data to control for worker ability to an extent that non-experimental papers have so far struggled to do. Our ability measure captures the raw skills that the workers offer the employer, allowing us to study the extent to which the same skills provide men higher wages than women.==== We estimate that skills explain up to a half of the wage gap, but a significant gap remains conditional on skills, suggesting that women capture less of the surplus their work creates.====Combining data from surveys of a nearly representative subset of the workers in our 70 factories with a model, and using the fact that all workers in our sample would have started their careers in the sector with very similar entry wages, we decompose the wage gap into three parts. The first part arises from gender differences in within-factory salary increases, the second from differences in movements across factories, and the third from differences in the length of careers in the sector. Given the cross sectional / short panel nature of our data, the cross-factory component is not observable directly in the data, but can be estimated structurally from the model. We find that roughly half of the wage gap is attributable to men having longer careers in the sector. The other half is explained in roughly equal parts by men’s faster wage growth within factories and more frequent movement between factories. The role of cross-factory wage increases suggests that lower mobility of female workers play a part in reducing their wage growth. In line with this hypothesis, we find that, relative to men, women change factories more often in areas where many factories are located within walking distance, though we do not find a significant effect of this factory density measure on wage gaps directly.====Our evidence is most consistent with gendered norms limiting women’s commuting options and possibilities to move between employers, hurting their bargaining position with factories (Manning, 2013), in line with other recent research on the constraints that commuting puts on women in South Asia (Borker, 2018, Sajjad, Anjum, Fiedl, Vyborny, 2017). We find little evidence that promotion or wage growth rates of women are affected by their marital or parental status, in contrast to recent evidence from higher income countries (Adda, Dustmann, Stevens, 2017, Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimuller, 2019, Kleven, Landais, Sogaard, 2018).====The fact that women in the sector earn less even conditional on precise skills measures is consistent with female workers having weaker bargaining positions vis à vis factories. Weaker bargaining positions could stem in principle from a number of alternative sources. As argued above, women may have fewer employment options outside the garment sector: 40 percent of women with less than tertiary education in full-time non-agricultural wage-employment in Bangladesh work in the RMG sector, compared with only 15 percent of men.==== Hardy and Kagy (2020) document norm-based limitations on the “appropriate” jobs for women in Ghana. However, if a lack of employment options outside the sector drives the results, we might expect women to pursue their careers at least as vigorously inside the sector as men, for example by moving as much as men between factories to gain promotions. The results from our data and model do not suggest that this is the case. Our results are more consistent with women’s bargaining power being weakened by broader gender norms that restrict women’s access to labor markets regardless of their marital of parental status. Such norms are still widespread in the South Asian context, and are often motivated by concerns for the safety and “modesty” of women when moving in the public (Dahr, Jain, Jayachandran, 2019, Dean, Jayachandran, 2019, Field, Pande, Rigol, Schaner, Moore, 2019, Munoz-Boudet, Petesch, Turk, Thumala, 2012).====Gender norms may also directly affect work effort and career ambitions of workers of both sexes. Bertrand et al. (2015) find that many women in the U.S. curtail their career ambition so that they do not earn more than their spouses. For the Bangladeshi garment sector, Macchiavello et al. (2020) show that managers and workers of both sexes believe that women are less capable supervisors in the factories, even though objective measures do not support these beliefs. Such dynamics could reduce the career ambitions of women in the sector, resulting in lower wage growth both internally and through movement across factories, consistent with recent research showing that minority workers in French supermarkets reduce work effort when working under biased managers (Glover et al., 2017). Interestingly, while we do not find evidence that marital or parental status affects female worker’s career behavior, we do find that married men move more frequently between factories, consistent with “breadwinner” norms directly affecting career behaviors of men (de Linde Leonard and Stanley (2015), and Sobel (2012)).====We begin by describing the data we use in the analysis in more detail. We next examine the gender wage gaps, first using the full administrative sample, and then the subsample of the data that allows us to control for the worker skills. We then briefly describe the model that allows us to back out wage growth rates when workers move between factories. We conclude by discussing evidence on how marriage, childbearing, and the density of factories around worker’s workplaces affect the wage gaps and worker mobility of men and women in the sector.",Gender wage gaps and worker mobility: Evidence from the garment sector in Bangladesh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712100035X,18 May 2021,2021,Research Article,199.0

These patterns are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 were the same with or without lockdowns. Our findings are consistent with the lifting of lockdowns having led to only modest employment recoveries in the US and UK, absent larger drops in infection rates.","We isolate the economic effect of COVID-19 that operates through the fear of infection: The fact that people voluntarily hunker down and curtail economic activities in response to local outbreaks, even without government-mandated lockdowns. Our estimate provides a unique reference point for the economic costs of the epidemic itself, which gives a sense of how much lockdowns are to blame for the ongoing economic crisis and also how quickly the economy may recover as lockdowns are lifted.====The Korean government prioritized intensive testing and contact tracing over social distancing during this period, and never mandated a lockdown. This resulted in two additional advantages of our estimation strategy: (i) Economic reactions were not prescribed by the government’s promulgation of what are essential or non-essential economic activities, unlike in the vast majority of countries, and (ii) As of May 20, 2020, its containment strategy resulted in a very low cumulative infection rate of 0.06 per thousand in Korea, excluding DG, ensuring that the direct effect was entirely confined to DG with a rate of 1.6 per thousand.====We exploit this setting using difference-in-differences (DiD) on data from an establishment survey, and separately from a household survey. The scheme captures the causal effect of the outbreak on local employment relative to the rest of the country. The establishment survey allows us to break down the effect by industry and establishment size, and the household survey allows us to estimate the effect by occupation, education, age, gender, and employment type. Our results are robust to seasonal adjustments and heterogeneous pre-trends between regions.==== Our causal estimate implies that even in the absence of lockdowns, a one per thousand increase in confirmed infections leads to a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. In comparison, non-causal estimates for the United States or the United Kingdom, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent. Thus, our results suggest that a significant fraction of their job losses may also be due to voluntary reductions in economic activity by private businesses and consumers, rather than a consequence of government-mandated lockdowns, with the caveat that an estimate from one country cannot be readily applied to other contexts.====Employment losses caused by local outbreaks stem mostly from reduced hiring by businesses and are mirrored by a rise in labor market non-participation rather than unemployment. Broken down by industry, losses are concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, similar to (non-causal) patterns observed in the US and UK.====Our finding that a rise in infections itself destroys jobs, even in the absence of lockdowns, suggests that lifting lockdowns may lead to only modest employment recoveries absent faster reductions in COVID-19 infection rates. In fact, the US unemployment rate remained in double digits and household spending continued to recover only slowly in June 2020 (====), despite most states reopening. The UK started to reopen all retail shops in mid-June, but year-on-year foot traffic was still down by 50 percent, from a drop exceeding 80 percent in March and April of 2020 (====). Almost half of UK survey respondents chose safety as the number one factor when deciding where to shop (====).====Of course, this is not to say that lockdowns are economically harmless either. As a blunt tool to squash infections, they may cause more economic damage than necessary. Targeted policies can contain the epidemic more effectively at a lower economic cost (====, ====).==== and ==== respectively show that DG’s industrial composition and worker demographics are similar to those of other regions. ==== compares industrial employment by region in the LFSE, our benchmark sample, against the Regional Employment Survey (RES), Korea’s official survey for regional employment by industry, conducted every April and October by Statistics Korea. The figure confirms that industrial composition by region is well-represented by the LFSE.====The remaining tables are robustness checks for our DiD estimates against heterogeneous pre-trends, seasonality, regional exports, and using an alternative dependent variable. To address potentially different pre-trends across regions, we modify ==== as:====The coefficients ==== and ==== capture linear trends over the sample period, which may differ by region (nationwide vs DG).====Seasonality is more of a concern for the time dummy ==== than for the DiD term ==== that captures the causal effect of the local outbreak. Neither the establishment survey (LFSE) nor the household survey (EAPS) provides seasonally adjusted series by region. So we first adjust for seasonality by ==== where ==== indexes industry, occupation, gender, age, or employment type; call it ====. Then seasonally adjusted employment of group ==== in region ==== at time ==== is constructed as:====We also address the possibility of lockdowns in other countries negatively affecting Korean exports and hence employment by region. The data, however, suggests that this should not be a concern. First, Korean exports did not decline in February and March. Moreover, the DG area is less export-dependent than the national average, and in any case, experienced higher growth in exports than other areas in February and average growth in March. As a result, controlling for exports makes the local impact of COVID-19 (====) larger.====Finally, we run regression ==== with an alternative dependent variable, regional employment divided by regional population (percentage share of employment). Our dependent variable in the benchmark estimation was employment change from time ==== to ==== as a percentage of time ==== employment.====–==== show the results. Time trends barely change our results, and seasonal adjustments lead to the post-treatment dummy ==== becoming more negative, especially in EAPS. For example, between February 15 and March 15, 2020, nationwide employment dropped by 2.5 percent with seasonal adjustment, compared to 0.6 percent from the baseline specification in the text. However, the DiD coefficient estimates, ==== are nearly identical to their counterparts in ==== and ====. Controlling for regional exports has a minor effect on the coefficients of interest.====When using employment as a fraction of the population (in percent) as the dependent variable, note that the coefficients cannot be directly compared to our benchmark estimates since the variables are in different units (percent change in employment vs. percentage-point change in the employment over population ratio). Nonetheless, the signs and relative magnitudes by industry or demographic are consistent with our benchmark estimates.",COVID-19 doesn’t need lockdowns to destroy jobs: The effect of local outbreaks in Korea,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000282,30 April 2021,2021,Research Article,200.0

Even with a STEM college degree, women are significantly less likely to work in STEM occupations than their male counterparts. This paper studies the determinants of the gender gap in college major choice and job choice between STEM and non-STEM fields and quantifies how much the gender wage gap can be explained by these choices using an extended Roy Model. I find that men’s ability sorting behavior is statistically stronger than women’s in major choice, yet ==== in ability and ability sorting together explain only a small portion of the gender gap in STEM majors. The gender gap in STEM occupations ==== be explained by the ==== in ability or ability sorting. Instead, a part of the gender gap in STEM occupations can be explained by the fact that women are more represented in less Math-intensive STEM majors and graduates from those majors are more likely to be well-matched to and to take jobs in non-STEM occupations. The other part of the gender gap in STEM occupations can be explained by women’s preference over work-life balance and women’s home location. The counterfactual analysis shows that about 13.7% of the gender wage gap among college graduates can be explained by the returns to STEM careers among the non-STEM women in the top 6.7% of the ability distribution.","Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college majors and occupations.==== Even with a STEM degree, young women’s participation decreases at each stage of the STEM pipeline (Xu, 2008). Why is the lack of women in the STEM fields a concern? First, we face a scarcity of STEM workers and there are signs showing substantial shortage in STEM labor supply while demand has been steadily increasing over decades.==== Second, as most of the STEM fields pay higher salaries than non-STEM fields, the lack of women in STEM may contribute to the gender wage gap (Beede, Julian, Langdon, McKittrick, Khan, Doms, 2011, Kahn, Ginther, 2017, Noonan, Xue, Larson, 2015). Third, when young women lack role models to motivate them and help them envision themselves in those positions, they are deterred by the idea that STEM is a “man’s field” where girls do not belong (Shapiro and Williams, 2012). Last, when women are not involved in STEM, products, services, and solutions are designed by men and according to their user experiences. The needs that are unique to women may be overlooked (Clayton, Collins, et al., 2014, Fisher, Margolis, 2002, Hong, Page, 2004).====The aim of this paper is threefold. First, I ask how much of the gender gap in STEM college majors can be explained by gender differences in ability sorting. This requires me to revisit the long-lasting debate on whether women are less prepared on STEM-related subjects and avoiding STEM college majors because of that. Second, I ask why women with STEM degrees are less likely to work in STEM occupations than their male counterparts. In particular, I assess how much ability, ability sorting, and preferences can explain the gender gap in STEM attrition after college graduation.==== Third, by simulating the counterfactual choices, I estimate the pecuniary returns to a STEM career for women who chose a non-STEM path by skill level and discuss how much contributes to the gender wage gap.====I analyze the questions above using unique administrative data from Purdue University, one of the nation’s leading public STEM institutions. It contains academic records of undergraduate students who graduated between 2007–2014 and is linked to the First Destination Survey conducted by the Purdue Center for Career Opportunities. The data provide rich information on individuals’ high school records, standardized test scores, college transcripts, and information on the first job since college graduation. To explore the endogenous choices of major and job between STEM and non-STEM and, more importantly, the gender differences in these choices, I apply an extended Roy model where individuals maximize their expected earnings by making the field choices conditional on the two latent skills, ==== and ====, as well as preferences over the field of study and workplace. It is not the intention of this paper to revisit the dynamic problem of college major choices, which fully explores college performance and how that affects one’s choice or update one’s belief, which has been well documented in higher education literature (e.g. Ahn, Arcidiacono, Hopson, Thomas, 2019, Arcidiacono, 2004, Arcidiacono, Hotz, Kang, 2012, Rask, Tiefenthaler, 2008). The main focus of this paper, by adopting the Roy model, is to assess to what extent the gender differences in ability sorting explain the gender gap in STEM fields and quantify the pecuniary returns to STEM degrees and careers.====I first show that, on average, skills are statistically weaker determinants of college major choice for women than men; however, gender differences in ability and ability sorting together explain only a small portion of the gender gap in STEM majors. This finding complements the large literature on the gender gap in college STEM degrees. While there is abundant literature that covers ability sorting in choice of college major==== and gender differences in college major choice,==== the debate on whether and to what extent the gender gap in STEM can be explained by gender differences in ==== and gender difference in ==== has not been settled. Some studies find that academic preparation in math and science is crucial in choosing a quantitative college major, and women’s low entry to STEM is mostly due to a lack of innate ability and less readiness in related subjects (Aucejo, James, et al., 2016, Card, Payne, 2017, Eccles, 2007, Ethington, Woffle, 1988, Hanson, Schaub, Baker, 1996, Speer, 2017, Trusty, 2002). Others argue that the small gender differences in preparation do not explain the large gender gap in STEM majors (Dickson, 2010, Kimmel, Miller, Eccles, 2012, Saltiel, 2019, Turner, Bowen, 1999, Xie, Shauman, A, 2003, Zafar, 2013), which aligns with the finding in my paper.====Second, I find that the gender gap in major choices is more pronounced among high-ability women. High-ability women are ==== likely to choose a STEM major while ==== rewarded in a STEM occupation than their high-ability male counterparts. The counterfactual analysis shows that the return to a STEM career for a high-ability woman is about $13,000–$20,000 in annual salary. About 13.66% of the gender wage gap among college graduates can be explained by the return to STEM careers among the non-STEM women in the top 6.67% of the ability distribution.==== To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to document the disproportionate and considerable number of high-ability women who choose a non-STEM path, quantify the total pecuniary return to STEM careers for this group, and then link the return to the gender wage gap. These findings add to the literature looks at the gender gap in college major as a substantial contribution to the gender wage gap (Blau, Kahn, 2017, Brown, Corcoran, 1997, Daymont and Andrisani, 1984, Eide, 1994).====Third, I contribute to the limited work on understanding the link between field choice and job choice. Young women’s participation decreases at each stage of the STEM pipeline with greater gender stratification in STEM occupations than STEM education, suggesting that factors other than ability or training generate gender gap in STEM occupations. Some studies find the demands of family and children are major nonacademic barriers for women on the pathway to a STEM profession (Hanson, Schaub, Baker, 1996, Kimmel, Miller, Eccles, 2012, Xie, Shauman, A, 2003). Hunt (2016) finds the major factor that drives the high exit rate of women leaving STEM fields is lack of promotion opportunities by female engineers, while the family-related constraints and dissatisfaction with the working conditions are only secondary factors. Taking one step back, I focus on STEM attrition regarding the first job choice of STEM college degree holders and investigate the gender differences in opting-out of STEM fields right after college graduation, which is one of my chief contributions in this paper.====I find no evidence showing that ability or ability sorting matters for STEM occupation choice or the gender gap in STEM occupations. In fact, part of the gender gap in STEM attrition could be attributed to the gender segregation in different STEM majors and how we define STEM jobs. Specifically, women are more represented in less Math-intensive STEM majors. Moreover, graduates from less Math-intensive STEM majors are more likely to be well-matched to and to take jobs in non-STEM occupations. Further, by fully decomposing the job decision equation, I show that both work-life balance preference and home region fixed effects largely explain the gender gap in STEM attrition. Female STEM degree holders who return to their home state are more likely to opt-out of STEM fields, potentially attributed to women’s preference on job location, family-related reasons, and stereotyping at their home state.","Women in STEM: Ability, preference, and value",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000269,31 March 2021,2021,Research Article,201.0

We define the duration of the STWT as the time needed for young people to secure their first regular job (at least six months) after completing their studies. We highlight the existence of dramatic inequality both across and within countries, namely by education level. The duration ranges on average from 13 (UK) to 34 months (Italy) and the gap still remains after 10 years. We then study the determinants of the duration by means of parametric survival models, with the distribution of hazard rates for finding a regular job being proxied by a Weibull distribution, which reveals the best fit based on a number of statistical tests. We test for omitted heterogeneity by means of the frailty survival model and find consistent evidence of positive duration dependence, suggesting that, as times passes, young people increase their hazard rate for finding a regular job as soon as they gain work experience and accumulate work-related competences.","In Europe, some young people seemingly have it all, while others have nothing. In some countries, the school-to-work transition (STWT) – the period from the completion of studies to the attainment of a stable job – goes smoothly and young people find themselves a job soon after completing their education, while others find the process to be a long one, sometimes needing years to complete their STWT. In this respect, Germany and Italy, for instance, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. One possible explanation for why this is the case, at least for young people with a higher-secondary-school diploma, is the fact that the German system is based on the dual principle (education and training go hand in hand), while the Italian system is sequential in essence (first education, and then work-related competences) (Pastore, 2015; 2018).====This paper aims to fill in two important gaps in previous research. First, we aim to measure the duration of the STWT in different European countries in the same comparable way, following the principle that the transition is completed when the young person secures at least a stable job. We use the only definition available in the EU-SILC data of “regular job,” namely a job of at least six months in length. In Section 5, we also address the case of the transition to a permanent job. Second, we try to identify the main determinants of dramatically different duration paths across a selection of 14 EU countries, the only ones for which comparable information is available in our dataset. Following a relatively recent stream of literature (Ryan, 2011; Vogel, 2002; Caroleo and Pastore, 2007; Pohl and Walther, 2007; Pastore, 2015; Hadjivassiliou et al., 2018), we identify different STWT regimes and compare them in our empirical analysis.====There has been only one previous attempt to measure the duration of the STWT. Eurostat (2012) examined transitions to any kind of job across all EU member states and found extremely short and smooth durations, including in South European countries. However, their measure may be partly biased. It mirrors, in fact, the effect of two-tier reforms and the ensuing diffusion of temporary work arrangements, which have shortened the duration of unemployment spells, but not the duration of the overall STWT, meaning here a transition to a permanent job or a temporary job that is considered satisfactory by young people (ILO, 2020). However, it is well known that most young people do not stop searching for a new job and consider themselves to still be “in transition” until they have attained a permanent job or a satisfactory temporary job. Therefore, caution must be exercised in considering the attainment of a temporary job as an end to the STWT.====In this paper, we reach a very different conclusion regarding the actual distribution of the duration of the STWT in Europe by examining the transition to a regular job. We no longer see a common European social model, as found in the Eurostat (2012) analysis, but rather the re-emergence of completely different STWT regimes across the continent. In other words, it is the process of homogenization due to two-tier reforms that is apparent in the Eurostat (2012) analysis.====We aim to measure the overall length of the STWT from when education is completed, and the last degree is achieved, to when the individual has found a “regular job,” without constraining our observation period to the first two years of the transition.====In step two of the analysis, we study the determinants of the duration of the STWT, in terms of a young individual's probability of finding a job, using a parametric duration model with a Weibull distribution, chosen as a result of statistical testing as the best fit to the data at hand [in terms of the bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC)]. Further, we study the consequences of the recent diffusion of temporary contracts on the duration of the transition, splitting the analysis of duration by type of job contract (permanent ==== temporary). In addition, the analysis is repeated, both accounting for and excluding student-workers, in order to measure the impact of this sub-collective on the overall results.====This paper adds to the existing literature on the STWT in several ways. First of all, we use duration models to estimate the determinants of the probability of exiting from the STWT. We distinguish individuals by their level of education, which allows us to assess the different impact that our determinants have on the duration of unemployment according to individuals’ level of education. Then, as noted above, we extend the analysis to different types of STWT regime, which allows us to examine several institutional factors, for which we try to identify the relevance.====What emerges is an extreme variability in the overall duration of the STWT across European countries. Considering only the individuals who have completed the transition, in some countries this lasts nine months (UK), while in others (Italy), this lasts 34 months (on average). It is in fact widely recognized that the duration of the STWT depends on the type of STWT regime and, more specifically, on the actual institutions on which they are based. In fact, the characteristics of the education system and its ability to stimulate the acquisition of skills and competences required in the labor market may be decisive factors in shortening and smoothing the STWT. However, an important role is also played by how the labor market functions and, in particular, by local unemployment levels. The survivor functions used to this aim allow us to identify the effective performance of each country, after controlling for all covariates measuring individuals’ characteristics.====Last but not least, we test whether there is duration dependence in the STWT. Previous research regarding the duration of unemployment spells, focusing on individuals who have lost their job and who are therefore not necessarily young, has found some evidence of negative duration dependence (Lancaster, 1979; Nickell, 1979): with increasing duration of unemployment, the probability of finding a job decreases. Supply- and demand-side factors explain this finding in turn: workers’ human capital quickly loses value, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, potential employers consider longer durations of unemployment as evidence of a low attitude and motivation to work. Later research has demonstrated, however, that negative duration dependence is essentially due to omitted heterogeneity in unemployed job seekers (Heckman and Borjas 1980; Heckman and Singer, 1984): those who have longer unemployment spells and also lower job-finding rates represent the majority of the unemployed and are less skilled and motivated than average. The policy implications of these two approaches are different, but they can be effectively combined. In the first approach, duration dependence can be mitigated simply by increasing the degree of labor-market flexibility, while, in the second approach, only training policy, specifically targeted at the deficiencies of individuals with low skills, can change the overall duration of unemployment.====In our case, before correcting for unobserved heterogeneity, results show the presence of negative duration dependence in accordance with Lancaster's (1979) and Nickell's (1979) findings; however, when we account for unobserved heterogeneity, a positive duration dependence clearly emerges from the data, which is consistent across countries. An important contribution of this paper is that it provides a specific interpretation of this positive duration dependence as mirroring a process of learning by searching: in other words, young people learn work-related skills during their search, which increases their chances of finding a job over time.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 illustrates the methodology adopted in the empirical analysis and explains how it allows our interpretative hypotheses on the determinants of the duration of the STWT to be addressed. Section 3 discusses several aspects of the definition of the main variables used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the results of the descriptive and regression analysis.

We combine data on internet availability at the local level with German individual register and vacancy data. Results show that internet availability has no major impact on the stability of new matches and their wages. We confirm these findings using vacancy data, by explicitly comparing match outcomes of online and non-online recruits. Further results show that online recruiting not only raises the number of applicants and the share of unsuitable candidates per vacancy, but also induces employers to post more vacancies.","The advent of the internet has fundamentally changed the way how workers and employers search for each other and eventually form a match (Autor, 2001). This trend is mirrored by the increased use of online search and recruiting tools by individual job seekers and employers (DeVaro and Gürtler, 2018). Online search tools go along with a considerable decline in search frictions arising from imperfect information and transaction costs. Given these developments, a question of particular interest is whether search via the internet along with the improved market information help to establish better matches in the labor market.====So far, the empirical literature has primarily focussed on the impact of online job search on job finding probabilities. Studies dealing with the relationship between the internet and unemployment outcomes have remained inconclusive, though, as the effects range from zero to positive.==== While the established effects on job finding probabilities may reflect a change in matching efficiency, they tell us nothing about the internet’s impact on the quality of matches arising from online search. The present study aims to fill this gap, by exploring the effect of the expansion of high-speed internet on match quality outcomes of newly hired workers. To do so, we exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by the expansion of high-speed internet (DSL) at the regional level in Germany. Using a combination of administrative and vacancy-level data, we merge employment histories of newly hired workers with information on their recruitment processes. Compared to previous studies, which often rely on job seekers’ search channels, this allows us to explicitly compare outcomes of online and non-online recruits.====There are several mechanisms through which online job search and recruiting tools may improve the match quality of newly hired workers. First, employers may use the internet for online screening, e.g., by restricting online applications only to those candidates possessing the required qualifications. Second, by way of identifying and notifying plausible matches based on matching algorithms, online recruiting software may speed up the process in which employers and individuals find one another. As a result, online tools are likely to raise the number of meetings between employers and individual job seekers per time unit. Theory predicts that a potential increase in matching efficiency will give rise to an increase in the reservation match quality (Krueger, 2000), which will in turn raise productivity, workers’ earnings, and firms’ profits.====Yet, another hypothesis is that the internet may take a role in reducing the quality of matching due to adverse selection: The underlying rationale is that the dramatic decline in search and application costs may entail excess applications, with many workers applying to considerably more jobs compared with more traditional search channels. Excess applications are likely to be especially relevant for poor candidates, who would not have applied if the submission of their applications had been more costly. This may create additional costs of screening, as employers need to spend more time and effort in establishing the required qualifications of their applicants (Autor, 2001). Overall, these considerations make clear that the direction of the internet’s effect on the match quality is generally ambiguous.====Despite a key role in theory, only a small number of studies have empirically analyzed this issue.==== Moreover, a limitation of the existing studies is that they rely on information on individual job seekers’ search strategies. This is problematic as the use of the internet for individual job search does not necessarily imply that individuals were actually hired through online recruiting. The reason is that job seekers may use multiple job search channels.====Based on a combination of administrative and vacancy-level data, our study contributes to this sparse literature by explicitly comparing new matches that were hired through online search and recruiting to those that were formed via different recruitment channels. An additional novelty of our study is that we are able to address the phenomenon of excess applications that may arise with online search, as our data allow us to retrieve information on the number (and fraction) of suitable applicants. A further contribution of our analysis is that we exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by the expansion of high-speed internet (DSL) at the regional level in Germany. The source of variation - described in detail by Falck et al. (2014) - stems from technological peculiarities of the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), through which the early generations of DSL have been implemented. The crucial issue causing exogenous variation in DSL availability is that, while the length of the copper wires connecting households and the main distribution frames (MDFs) – whose distribution was determined in the 1960s – did not matter for telephone services, it strongly affected the DSL connection. In particular, there exists a critical value of 4,200 meters, such that for municipalities with distances to the next MDF that lie above this threshold no access to DSL was possible. The only way to provide internet access was to replace copper wires by fiber wires, which took time and was costly.====Using this exogenous variation in internet availability during the early DSL years, we start by estimating the internet effects on characteristics of job matches at the municipality level. We instrument DSL availability at the municipality level by the distance to the next MDF and measure characteristics of jobs in the flow of newly hired workers coming out of unemployment. In this group, the impact of the internet on outcomes such as employment stability is more likely to capture effects that arise from a change in search channels than in the group of workers searching on-the-job. The reason is, as we will argue below, that the restriction in internet availability prior to the DSL expansion was more binding for unemployed than for employed job seekers. This is especially relevant as estimation at the municipality level only allows for identification of intention to treat (ITT) effects. To explore more direct effects of the ==== of online recruiting, we additionally link the employment outcomes of newly hired workers to vacancy-level data. Though this comes at the expense of a much smaller sample size, it enables us to obtain a more comprehensive view on the effects. First, employment histories after (online) recruitings are informative on effects on conventional job characteristics and outcomes such as employment stability and wages. Secondly, the vacancy-level data are informative on applications and vacancy creation. This enables us to explore concessions that employers make when choosing a candidate, which may be considered as a measure of job-worker mismatch. For ease of exposition, we refer to the joint set of outcome measures as match quality indicators, where it should be kept in mind that some of these (notably conventional job characteristics) may just reflect job quality rather than match quality.====Based on this empirical strategy, we document the following key findings. The results from the municipality-level analysis suggest that for the full sample the increase in internet availability affects neither employment stability nor wage outcomes. If anything, internet availability reduces employment-to-unemployment transitions for formerly unemployed male and white-collar workers. For these subgroups the effects are found to be non-negligible, but the precision of the estimates is low. The analysis based on vacancy-level data confirms the absence of any effects of online recruiting on wages and provides evidence of a slight increase in employment stability, with the effect being driven by reduced employment-to-employment transitions. Looking at potential mechanisms underlying the absence of major effects, we find that online recruiting leads to a dramatic increase in the number of applications and raises the share of unsuitable candidates, while at the same time inducing employers to post more vacancies. We also find some weak evidence that adverse selection with online recruiting is more relevant for females.====The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. The next section provides descriptive evidence for the diffusion of broadband internet at the individual and employer level and its importance for job search and recruiting behavior.

We find that both OLS and 2SLS estimates are negative across a wide range of alternative specifications, suggesting that firms substitute between training and hiring workers when the supply of skilled workers is higher. Our preferred 2SLS estimate implies that the increase in firms’ share of cross-border workers within our observation period, from 1995 to 2008, led to about 3500 fewer ==== positions (equal to about 2% of the total number of apprentice positions).","Integrating the labor markets of their member countries has been a key objective within the European Union and the associated non-member states. One of the main rationales of these efforts being that these policies are designed to spur gains in innovation and productivity and, consequently, growth (e.g. Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010, Peri, 2012). A potential downside of such policies, however, is that easier access to external labor markets may undermine firms’ incentives to train their own workers in countries attracting (many) immigrant workers. This kind of trade-off is arguably of particular relevance in countries with highly developed apprenticeship systems, such as Switzerland, which serve a large number of adolescents across a broad range of different occupations. Indeed, in the Swiss context, apprenticeship training remains the main educational track at the upper-secondary level, serving about two-thirds of each incoming cohort (SERI, 2019).====In this paper, we estimate – against this broader background – employers’ short-run substitution between the training of apprentices and the hiring of cross-border workers (hereafter CBWs), i.e. non-resident immigrant workers who live in one of the neighboring countries but who work regularly in Switzerland. From the perspective of an employer, being located closer to the border may provide the opportunity to have easier access to fully trained skilled workers. Consistent with this argument, previous studies document substantive costs of hiring skilled workers for Swiss employers (Blatter, Muehlemann, Schenker, 2012, Muehlemann, Strupler Leiser, 2018) and show that firms’ training intensity is quite sensitive to these costs (Blatter et al., 2015). Moreover, training apprentices can be costly for employers – about a third of all apprenticeships are associated with, in some cases substantive, net costs from apprenticeship training – and a greater supply of skilled workers may further tip the balance between training and hiring if it brings down skilled workers’ wages, relative to those of apprentices in the same occupation. We therefore hypothesize that (easier) access to CBWs will decrease the costs of hiring skilled workers, and eventually also the wages of skilled workers, and that this will lead some firms to substitute away from training their own workforce to hiring more or additional CBWs in the medium run. We also expect that the substitution is more pronounced for the higher skilled occupations, which are characterized by both high training costs and high hiring costs, as we will discuss in more detail below.====In our empirical analysis, we exclusively focus on the substitution with CBWs for both substantive and methodological reasons. First, and in contrast to many immigrants both working and living in Switzerland (resident immigrant workers, henceforth====), CBWs presumably have skills similar to those of natives and they have the advantage that they usually speak the same language as natives (e.g. Hoen, 2020, Stöhr, 2015). We therefore expect that the substitutability will be higher between apprentices and CBWs than between apprentices and non-native workers in general – many of whom are low(er) skilled and/or do not speak any of the country’s official languages.==== Second, CBWs are quantitatively relevant in the Swiss labor market: CBWs made up about 4.8% of the total workforce in the year 2008 (i.e. the year which marks the endpoint of our empirical analysis), representing about 18.2% of the total foreign workforce in that year. Moreover, in relative terms, the increase in CBWs has recently been much greater than in resident immigrant workers; between 1995 and 2008 (our analysis period), the total number of CBWs increased by about 46.1% (from 146,773 to 214,377); then, between 2008 and 2018, it increased by an additional 46.4% (to a total of 313,926 CBWs).==== Third and finally, the focus on CBWs gives us the opportunity to implement a simple but powerful instrumental-variable approach based on the country’s geography. Obviously, a firm’s possibility to fall back on CBWs depends on its location relative to the national border. The closer to the border a firm is located, ceteris-paribus, the larger the pool of CBWs potentially available for this firm. Thus, we consider the shortest travel time from a firm’s location (i.e. the municipality it is located in) to the country border as a valid instrument for the share of CBWs a firm employs, as we will argue in much more detail below.====Our empirical approach is very close to the one used by Dustmannet al. (2017), who exploit the introduction of a policy in 1991 which led to a sudden and large influx of Czech CBWs into the German labor market. Specifially, the policy allowed Czech workers to seek employment, but not residence, in border municipalities (see also Moritz, 2011). They find a moderate negative effect on native wages and a rather large negative effect on native employment – the authors find that a one percentage point increase in the number of Czech CBWs decreased native employment by about 0.93% three years after the policy has been implemented. They also find that the employment effects are more pronounced for unskilled workers, who represent a closer substitute for inflowing Czech workers. Our empirical strategy is also close to that of Beerli et al., 2018, who use a difference-in-differences approach to study how the removal of all remaining immigration restrictions for workers from the European Union increased the number of CBWs to Switzerland – and how this in turn affected employment and wages in the regions close to the border. Overall, they find that the removal of the remaining restrictions led to an increase in overall native employment, arguing that the policy increased overall labor demand by firms.====Broadly consistent with the evidence from Dustmann et al. (2017), we find that firms which have easier access to hiring skilled workers partially substitute the training of resident apprentices with hiring additional cross-border workers. Our OLS and 2SLS estimates are consistent with each other and are robust across a wide range of robustness checks. Moreover, as expected, 2SLS estimates are larger (in absolute value) than the corresponding OLS estimates, and they are precisely enough estimated to rule out statistical equivalence between OLS and 2SLS estimates. We also find that the negative effect of CBWs on the number of apprentices is increasing in the underlying hiring costs. Our preferred 2SLS estimate implies that an increase in the average share of CBWs across firms of 1.14 percentage points (corresponding to the observed increase in the share of CBWs between 1995 and 2008, i.e. our analysis period) leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of apprenticeship positions of about 2% (equal to about 3500 apprenticeship positions in absolute terms); a significant effect in both statistical and substantive terms.====In contrast to our study, previous studies on the effects of immigrants on the Swiss labor market have mainly focused on the overall effect of immigration on either wages and/or employment among residents (i.e. natives and previous immigrants).==== For example, Gerfin and Kaiser (2010), using the structural skill-cell approach, estimate the wage effects from immigration for the period 2002 to 2008. Their findings are mixed: While natives face no wage pressure on average, previously immigrants’ wages are negatively affected. Across educational subgroups, highly-educated workers incur the largest wage losses. Favre et al. (2013) reach similar conclusions, applying a shift-share instrumental-variable approach and focusing on the period between 2002 and 2010. Moreover, their analysis also covers CBWs. They find no overall negative effects of immigrants or CBWs on employment, neither for Swiss-born nor for previously immigrated workers. Again, however, they find statistically significant effects for certain educational subgroups. According to their analysis, a one percent increase in the workforce due to immigration leads to a drop in the employment rate of high skilled Swiss-born workers of 0.3 percentage points. Moreover, while immigration does not affect the employment rate of previously immigrated workers, CBW inflows do: a one percent increase in the workforce due to CBWs decreases the employment rate of previously immigrated workers by 0.2 percentage points. Similarly, Basten and Siegenthaler (2019) find that immigration had limited negative effects on natives’ employment and wages. Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016) explicitly focus on the increase in the number of CBWs in a difference-in-difference approach and conclude that CBWs helped firms overcome their skill shortages and increased firms’ productivity without crowding out native employment. The study by Beerli et al. (2018), already mentioned above, also finds that the overall effects of immigration were positive. Our study complements this literature by providing estimates on the substitution of apprentices with CBWs, a question which has not yet been adressed in the empirical literature so far. It also illustrates that there is nothing contradictory in finding both positive and negative effects of immigration at the same time and that immigration policy may therefore involve difficult policy trade-offs.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some background on immigration to Switzerland, describes the institutional background of the Swiss apprenticeship system, and formulates our main hypothesis. Section 3 presents the main data sources and the construction of the key variables, along with descriptive statistics of the key variables. Section 4 discusses our empirical strategy.

We examine whether non-contributory pensions – an increasingly important component of many welfare systems, have curtailed the internal migration of younger cohorts over the past three decades. Using changes in the number of beneficiaries brought about by a ==== in 1991, we show that old-age non-contributory pensions are associated with reduced internal migration of 25-to-35 year old men and women with less human capital. The effects do not appear to be driven by intergenerational reciprocity or ==== exchanges, and do not extend to other types of pensions, hinting on systematic employment barriers faced by younger, less educated, or unexperienced men and women from ==== qualifying for these pensions. The ability to rely on the support from older family members residing nearby might provide a lifeline but, simultaneously, curtail their propensity to out-migrate.","Researchers have, for quite some time, recognized the role of the welfare state on migration. The literature on this topic has primarily focused on two main areas. One set of studies has examined the role played by unemployment insurance (Antolín and Bover, 1997; Hassler et al., 2005; Tatsiramos, 2009; Jofre-Monseny 2014). These analyses generally conclude that unemployment benefits need to be large to deter migration. Another group of studies has focused, instead, on the role of family benefits as welfare magnets, primarily in the United States (Gelbach, 2004; McKinnish, 2007). For the most part, this second literature concludes that welfare migration is limited and typically larger for families living close to state borders.====Economists have also studied the impact of old-age pensions on other family member's social and economic outcomes, primarily in developing countries. Studies in that literature have focused on the impact of old-age pensions on children's schooling (Case and Deaton, 1998), children's health (Duflo, 2003), living arrangements (Hamoudi and Thomas, 2014), consumption (Angelucci and Di Giorgi 2009), and labor market participation (Juarez and Pfutze, 2015; Galiani et al., 2016; Borrella-Mas et al., 2016; Bratti et al., 2018). However, although strong family ties are recognized as a migration deterrent (Spilimbergo and Ubeda, 2004; Alesina et al., 2015), the literature has yet to explore the role of old-age non-contributory pensions received by extended family members on the migration of working-age individuals.====In this paper, we look at how old-age non-contributory pensions received by extended family members might influence the internal migration of younger, working-age individuals in Spain. Spanish non-contributory pensions accrue to individuals who have not worked sufficiently to qualify for contributory pensions and who have no other sources of income (OECD, 2019). For those eligible, the program raises household income –an increase that may be shared with other family members. This typically parental inter-vivo support is more likely to benefit the offspring residing nearby for various reasons. ====, as emphasized by Fu (2019), close relatives are more likely to become future caregivers than those residing far away. As such, parents might be more inclined to assist their nearby offspring. ====, in-kind transfers (such as the provision of room and board, childcare or home cooked meals), which often have no close substitute, can only be provided if the two parties involved live nearby (Laferrere and Wolff, 2006).====Spain shares with other Mediterranean welfare states, such as Greece and Italy, a generous public pension system and a strong reliance on the family unit as the ultimate safety net (Ferrera, 1996; Börsch-Supan, 2013). Despite having a structurally high unemployment rate and large spatial unemployment differences,==== internal migration remains rather low in Spain (Ahn et al., 1999; Antolín and Bover, 1997). Internal migration is particularly low relative to other European countries, as well as relative to other developed and less developed economies. Spain is the only European nation with a 5-year internal migration intensity that falls below 10 percent (Bell et al., 2015).==== This was not always the case. During the 1960s and 1970s, many Spanish workers emigrated from economically struggling regions like Andalucía or Extremadura to the prosperous regions of Madrid or Cataluña (Bover and Velilla, 2005). The expansion of the welfare state has been previously proposed as a potential explanation for the low level of internal migration in Spain (Antolín and Bover, 1997; Bover and Velilla, 2005). However, the role played by the welfare state in explaining migration has not been directly examined. Internal migration may no longer be indispensable if there exists a reliable public safety net. In Europe, where public safety nets characteristic of a welfare state are widespread, adverse shocks have translated into higher unemployment rates and lower labor force participation rates. On the contrary, in countries with a less extensive welfare state, as is the case of the Unites States, adverse shocks lead to higher migration rates instead (Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Jimeno and Bentolila, 1998; Jauer et al. 2019; Mitze, 2019).====We follow previous literature and consider internal migration as the relocation to a new labor market in response to geographic differences in expected utility at destination and at the origin, focusing on the role that monetary and in-kind support from nearby relatives may play in predicting such moves. Working-age individuals may take into consideration the support from relatives –particularly, the non-transferable kind, such as room and board or childcare– when deciding whether to out-migrate. Ideally, to gauge the impact of non-contributory pensions on migration, we would like to have longitudinal data on individuals’ residential location, receipt of parental support, as well as parental residence and old-age pension receipt. This would allow us to directly gauge the impact of old-age pensions received by parents on children's migration. Unfortunately, such dataset does not exist. However, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of having a family member receiving a non-contributory pension is positively correlated to the share of non-contributory pensioners in their location. Then, we can rely on data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey, the Residential Variations Statistics, and the Social Security Statistics for the 1988 through 2015 period, to examine the impact of non-contributory pensions –as captured by the policy reform that introduced new non-contributory pensions in 1991 (pensions that gradually replaced the existing social assistance pensions over the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s) – on the migration of working-age individuals. In an attempt to isolate the effect of the policy change, we exploit cross-province differences in the take-up rate of the newer pensions over the 1988 through 2015 period, while accounting for a wide range of individual demographic and human capital traits, as well as temporal and provincial fixed-effects. In addition, we include several province-specific time varying traits potentially correlated with non-contributory pension receipt, such as differences between origin and potential destination provinces (weighted by historical internal migration flows) in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment rates, housing prices, the share of the population receiving unemployment benefits, and the share 65 years of age or older.====We find that old-age non-contributory pensions are associated with reduced migration among young, less skilled, 25-to-35 years-old men and women. Our results prove robust to the use of alternative samples that exclude the foreign-born, provinces providing alternative sources of income support, or the years during which a Dependency Law was in place. Additionally, they do not predate the regulation of non-contributory pensions in 1991, nor can the differential take-up rate of the pensions across provinces be predicted by differences in migration patterns across provinces prior to the 1991 reform.====We also consider two potential mechanisms at play -namely, intergenerational reciprocity and limited employment opportunities (Chan and Ermisch, 2015). We fail to find evidence of intergenerational reciprocity or ==== exchanges, as disability pensions –more likely to be linked to the care of their recipients, do not generate the same response. Additionally, the observed impact of non-contributory pensions on the lack of regional mobility among younger, less skilled cohorts is not driven by those with young children who might benefit from the childcare and childrearing assistance provided by older family members. Rather, limited employment opportunities might be the primary reason for the role of non-contributory pensions on the limited out-migration of young men and women with less human capital for various reasons. ====, the effect is concentrated on younger individuals with either less education or no work experience, for whom we know job openings are limited. ====, only the safety net provided by non-contributory pensions seems to matter, hinting on the relevance of family, possibly in-kind support more likely to dominate among low-income families (Moreno-Mínguez, 2017), who also might be in a worse position to assist their offspring in their labor market search. Youth emancipation, educational programs and work internships targeted at this younger cohort of men and women might prove helpful in promoting their migration and, in the process, address labor market imbalances.====This study is innovative in its effort to assess the link between public assistance in the form of old-age non-contributory pensions and migration of working-age individuals. Unlike prior work examining the role of unemployment insurance or welfare benefits, our focus is on old-age non-contributory pensions received by the elderly. Assessing their impact on the migration of younger cohorts is especially important in a country like Spain where, despite the expansion of the welfare state during the past decades (Guillén and León, 2011), families still provide the ultimate safety net (Bentolila and Ichino, 2008). The ability to rely on the assistance provided by extended family members living nearby may have contributed to the relatively low out-migration of working-age individuals facing employment challenges. Our intent is to gauge if that has been the case and, when applicable, to what extent.====In addition, we wish to understand the types of public assistance associated to distinct migration responses, as well as the affected demographic groups, to gain insights into the mechanisms at play. If only certain types of pensions matter, it might be indicative of systematic migration challenges faced by the offspring of specific population subgroups qualifying for such pensions, ==== low-income households. Likewise, learning about the demographic traits of those impacted allow us to further understand some likely determinants, such as limited employment opportunities for those younger, less educated, and unexperienced.====Finally, to date, most of the research on the impact of non-contributory pensions has focused on Latin American and African countries (==== Duflo, 2003; Juarez and Pfutze, 2015). Analyzing the Spanish case allows to extend our understanding of the impact of old-age non-contributory pensions on the social and economic outcomes of family members in the context of a developed economy –an analysis that may yield a different set of policy recommendations. In this regard, the findings contribute to the literature on emancipation decisions of youth in Southern European countries by informing about how, through diminished internal migration, the welfare state might be associated to ongoing emancipation delays (Aparicio-Fenoll and Oppedisano, 2015; Ahn and Sánchez-Marcos, 2017).",The role of non-contributory pensions on internal mobility in Spain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000154,11 March 2021,2021,Research Article,205.0

The implementation of a new rural pension scheme offers a unique setting for studying the peer effects in financial decision-making among low-income people. The data are from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). Our main results suggest that an individual's choice of participation decisions and contribution level are significantly affected by both the choices and characteristics of his/her peers while there is no evidence of significant peer effects in the participation intention. The behaviors of interrupting and starting to enroll are also influenced by their peers. The influence of peer effects is mediated by social norms and information transmission about the benefits, costs, and risks of choices. In monetary terms, the peer effect is estimated to have an equivalent effect with increasing the household income by 0.57 percent.","The reality of ‘getting old before getting rich’ and large amount outflow of rural middle-aged labor of China make rural old-age security be the focus of recent policy. By the end of 2017, there were 241 million elderly people aged 60 or above in China, including over 100 million in rural areas, and the number of left-behind elderly people is increasing year by year==== . The village retirement problem relates directly to the stability of Chinese village order and the continuous development of agriculture. In recent years, the government has raised spending on health and education in the countryside, and is starting to introduce rural pensions, that is the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). The Chinese government expects that villagers can be active participants in the pension plan, instead of relying on offspring. This makes it very important to understand how pension participation decisions are made.====In cities, the vast majority of the elderly have pension insurance, while most of the rural elderly in China mainly rely on traditional family care and land, obtaining pension security through the “feedback mode” of generation care and support (Jiang, 1995); Xu, 2001; Shen et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2014). This is because China has not included rural pension into the scope of public finance coverage before the implementation of the new rural insurance. With the establishment of the socialist market economic system, China's rural old-age system is experiencing a great change from family support to social support.====Many financial decisions are usually complicated and difficult considering the complexity of financial instruments, limited cognitive ability and experience (Agarwal et al., 2009; Bertrand and Morse, 2011; Agarwal and Mazumder, 2013), the high costs of thinking through many financial decisions (Madrian and Shea, 2001), the uncertainty about future earnings, and social norms (Lieber and William, 2018). It is much more convenient to learn from peers when they make these decisions. Bursztyn et al., (2014) find that one's peers tend to make similar financial decisions with him, both because they learn from his choice (“social learning”) and because his decision directly affects others’ utility of making the same decision (“social utility”). Peer influence could reinforce or offset the direct impact of a program's parameters on take-up (Dahl et al., 2014), therefore, the long-run equilibrium enrollment rate may be substantially lower or higher than otherwise expected.====There is abundant literature on the influence factors and what roles do peers play in retirement savings (e.g. Duflo and Saez, 2002; Duflo and Saez, 2003; Mugerman et al., 2014; Beshears et al., 2015; Lieber and William, 2018). However, their research subjects are people who have a regular job and fixed income, and little empirical evidence has shown whether or not the conclusion is also suitable for groups with low and unstable income. In a society based on agriculture, people will continue working in their field as long as they could to earn a living. In other words, individuals would not stop working in most cases just because of reaching a certain age, let alone retirement. In contrast with the widely investigated financial plans in the existing literature, the NRPS program we studied is rather unique and has been implemented in China for almost ten years. NRPS provides a choice and plays an assistant and supplemental role in the pension system in China, particularly to village residents and low-income residents====. According to the important role of establishing a social security system for the aged in rural areas on social development and harmony, it is extremely meaningful for us to study influencing factors of endowment insurance participation rate in such an under-developed area.====Second, we consider whether peer effects are evident in the propensity to make a participation strategy change in pension contributions. Beyond studying whether there are direct influences of peer effects on the participation decisions, we also consider the roles of peers in contribution amounts, decision to interrupt and to start enrollment, and true intention. Policy makers pay attention not only to whether people choose to participate, but also to whether they will continue staying in the program and not interrupt the premium payment disbursements after the participation, and how they choose the contribution level.====Third, this paper assumes that individual form heterogeneous expectations regarding peers’ decisions. For example, an individual may form different expectations regarding the participation probabilities of his or her young and old neighbors. Homogeneous rational expectations may not appropriate if people take peers’ characteristics into account when they form the rational expectations and if these characteristics vary across peers (Binder and Pesaran, 1998; Lee et al., 2014; Yang and Lee, 2017).====Building on the binary choice model with social interactions, we find strong evidence for substantial peer effects in program participation. Individuals are 16.15 percentage points more likely to participate in NRPS if the average expected peer participation choice increases by 1 (e.g. moving an individual from a group where none of his or her peers are expected to participate to a group where half of the peers are expected to participate). Characteristics of peers and unobserved factors shared by individuals within the same village, such as local customs or values and local policy advocacy, also have a significant influence on participation decisions. In contrast, there is no evidence of statistically significant peer effects in the participation intention, suggesting that the willingness to participate is not influenced by peers’ willingness.====For the change of decisions, we use a linear probability model to measure the effect of peers’ status on an individual's decision to interrupt or to start to enroll. Following Bisztray et al. (2018), we consider three types of peers: individuals living in the same village, and two placebo peer groups including individuals living in the same city but different villages, and individuals living in the same province but different cities. Results show significant peer effects only in the village network.====To further understand the source of peer effects, we explore several possible mechanisms. We find suggestive evidence for the sharing of information about costs, benefits, and risks. We find that smaller effects when residents pay higher attention to economic and financial information or are more willing to take risks. Policy implications drawn from these findings are giving more attention to the education of the consequences of enrollment and reducing uncertainty in the program. This paper also adds to peer effects literature by measuring the income equivalence of the peer effect on pension insurance take-up. We find that one more peer choosing to participate is equivalent to around a 0.57 percent increase in the average household income.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Variation in parental consent laws helps to identify the relative importance of each theoretical channel, and simulations decompose total policy effects into theoretical channels. Results indicate that the largest effect of parental consent laws is on the abortion decision for pregnant minors. But there are also meaningful effects on marriage opportunities for pregnant minors and on sexual and contraceptive behavior. These effects combine to impact family structure and human capital accumulation over the life-cycle. Simulations show that parental consent laws reduce the accumulation of human capital via impacts of children on school attendance and also increase the probability that women spend time as unwed mothers. A counterfactual abortion ban is predicted to increase birth rates at all ages and subsequently increase unwed motherhood and reduce schooling.","The relationship between fertility and partnership has changed significantly over the past sixty years in the United States. The percentage of births to unmarried women increased from 5.3 percent in 1960 to 39.7 percent in 2007 and has remained steady at roughly 40 percent through the present (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, Mathews, 2013, Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, 2019). Declines in marriage rates, increases in nonmarital childbearing, and increases in divorce rates have led to roughly one-third of children not living with two married parents.==== Taking note of these changes in family structure, social scientists have documented that single-parent homes and family disruption are associated with lower education, income, and health for both children and parents.====Given the significant associations between family structure and economic outcomes, it is important to understand how family structure comes about and the degree to which public policies might affect family structure. Abortion policy has been theorized to impact the key decisions and outcomes that determine family structure: sexual behavior and pregnancy, partnership, and childbearing. Abortion policy has also changed significantly over time. Elective abortion, while legal in a handful of states prior to 1973, became legal at a national level in 1973 following the Supreme Court case ====. States have since passed a variety of restrictions that increase the cost of obtaining an abortion. Changes in these state-level restrictions could affect a large number of women given that 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned and 42 percent of these pregnancies are aborted (Finer and Zolna, 2016).====The existing empirical research on abortion policy has tended to estimate its effects on the decisions and outcomes that contribute to family structure in isolation rather than using a framework that explicitly models the interrelated nature of these decisions and outcomes.==== In this paper, I develop and estimate a structural model of cohabitation, marriage, sexual and contraceptive behavior, abortion, and school attendance to shed light on the various ways in which abortion policy might impact family structure and women’s human capital accumulation. The model is designed to nest four distinct mechanisms that the theoretical literature on abortion has discussed but which have never been empirically distinguished.====Economic theory has viewed abortion as a decision that women make while weighing contemporaneous costs, personal preferences, and the impacts of having a child on lifetime utility. In this framework, a decrease in the cost of abortion could cause some pregnant women on the margin to switch from giving birth to aborting. If this is the only channel through which abortion costs impact behavior, then a decrease in the cost of abortion necessarily increases abortions and decreases births. I refer to this mechanism as the ====. However, a decrease in the cost of abortion also decreases the cost of pregnancy for women who would choose abortion. If individuals are forward-looking when making sexual and contraceptive decisions and avoiding pregnancy is costly, then these women will choose a higher probability of becoming pregnant.==== I refer to this mechanism as the ====. If there is no uncertainty in the (dis)utility associated with abortion and birth, then any new pregnancies stemming from the insurance effect are aborted. Taken together, the price effect and insurance effect imply that a decrease in the cost of abortion will lead to an increase in pregnancies, an increase in abortions, and a decrease in births.====The implications of a model that includes only a price effect and an insurance effect are consistent with results from the empirical literature on the 1973 legalization of abortion. A number of papers use variation in the timing of legalization across states to show that legalization increased pregnancy rates and decreased birth rates (Ananat, Gruber, Levine, 2007, Ananat, Gruber, Levine, Staiger, 2009, Gruber, Levine, Staiger, 1999, Levine, Staiger, Kane, Zimmerman, 1999). However, a handful of papers that have estimated the causal effect of state-level abortion policies on births have found that decreases in abortion costs either ==== the birth rate or do not have a significant effect (Kane, Staiger, 1996, Levine, Staiger, 2004, Levine, Trainor, Zimmerman, 1996).==== To explain these findings, Kane and Staiger (1996) propose a model in which some uncertainty about a partner’s commitment is resolved between conception and the abortion decision. A choice between abortion and birth may be uncertain, ex-ante, if the relative cost depends on some information revealed post-conception. Among women facing this uncertainty, a decrease in the cost of abortion decreases the ==== cost of pregnancy, which leads to a higher pregnancy rate. For some of these pregnancies, a revelation of positive information results in birth being optimal. I refer to this mechanism as the ====. The information effect will increase births when the cost of abortion falls, which means that the price effect and information effect impact births in opposite directions.====Akerlof et al. (1996) argue that it is also important to consider how contraception and abortion relate to competition in the market for partners. They use correlational evidence from time series data to link a decline in “shotgun marriages” to the legalization of birth control and abortion.==== To explain this link, they develop a model with two types of women: those who are willing to abort a pregnancy and those who are not. They argue that prior to the legalization of abortion both types would be unlikely to engage in extramarital sex without a promise of marriage should a pregnancy occur, which makes it more likely that men give and keep such promises. Once abortion is legalized, those women who are willing to abort a pregnancy become more willing to have extramarital sex without a promise of marriage should a pregnancy occur. Per Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz, this shift will affect competition in the market for partners and could lead to an equilibrium where promises of marriage become rare. Effects on competition in the market for partners could also have an impact on sexual and contraceptive behavior that is distinct from the insurance effect. I refer to any impact of abortion policy on partnership markets as ====Based on the existing literature, there are at least four distinct channels through which a change in the cost of abortion can impact behavior and outcomes, which I formally define as follows:====While the possibility of each of these mechanisms has been discussed, their significance and magnitude have not been separated. The external appendix uses simple models to show exactly how each mechanism operates and summarizes the potential impacts of each mechanism on pregnancies, abortions, births, single births, and single births as a proportion of all births. Importantly, multiple mechanisms could contribute to the impact of abortion policy on any of these outcomes, sometimes having effects in opposite directions.====Separately identifying these mechanisms is of theoretical interest, but is also of practical importance as the significance of each mechanism could vary by policy type and demographic group. Hence, considering the impacts of new or changing abortion policies on the population requires an understanding of the potential magnitude of these mechanisms. Further, the welfare implications of abortion policy depend on which mechanisms are relevant; only the competitive effect suggests that a decrease in the cost of abortion could result in welfare losses for some women.==== In direct contrast to the predictions of Akerlof et al. (1996) of such an effect, Chiappori and Oreffice (2008) develop a static, frictionless matching model of the marriage market that implies legalization of abortion increases welfare for all women. A primary difference is that Chiappori and Oreffice (2008) do not model preferences for sex and assume that unintended pregnancy is exogenous with respect to a change in the availability of abortion. They write that, “Our approach views fertility mostly as the intended consequence of a well-informed decision, whereas [Akerlof et al.’s] emphasizes children as involuntary by-products of sex.” I model individuals as deciding an amount of sexual activity and contraceptive use while taking into consideration the impact of these decisions on the probability of becoming pregnant, which allows for both “intended” and “unintended” pregnancy.====To begin my analysis, I use longitudinal data that follows over 3,000 women for fifteen years, from 1997 through 2011, to examine the effects of within-state variation in parental consent laws for abortion and Medicaid funding restrictions.==== Regression models with state and year effects, as well as state-specific time trends, suggest that parental consent laws significantly reduce the probability of aborting a pregnancy among women subject to the restrictions, but have insignificant effects on the probability of pregnancy. The effect of parental consent laws on abortion given pregnancy supports the existence of price effects for these laws. Medicaid funding restrictions are estimated to have insignificant effects on both abortion and pregnancy. I also estimate the effects of each of these policies on the probability of marriage and cohabitation following a pregnancy to provide preliminary evidence for competitive effects. The results suggest that parental consent laws significantly increase the probability that a minor who becomes pregnant is married in the year following the pregnancy. This result supports the existence of a competitive effect for these laws. Similar to the other regression models, Medicaid funding restrictions have statistically insignificant effects in the models for marriage and cohabitation. As I describe in more detail below, the within-state variation in Medicaid funding restrictions during the years that my sample covers is very limited. Further, for those states that do experience a change in Medicaid funding restrictions, the change may have had limited or no impact on the extent to which the Medicaid system paid for abortion in practice. These realities coupled with the results from the reduced-form exercises leads me to focus on the impacts of parental consent laws.====I next design and estimate a life-cycle model that contributes to a group of papers that estimate structural models of fertility and partnership decisions (Brien, Lillard, Stern, 2006, Eckstein, Wolpin, 1989, Francesconi, 2002, Keane, Wolpin, 2010, van der Klaauw, 1996, Sheran, 2007). Most of these papers treat pregnancy as the decision variable rather than sexual behavior, ignoring abortion and assuming that pregnancy is timed perfectly.==== Further, many papers that model fertility restrict the sample to married women and those that model partnership leave fertility as an exogenous process. The model presented in this paper allows for endogenous pregnancy probabilities, abortion, and partnership. Marriage and cohabitation markets are modeled in a search context, with partnership offers arriving with a probability that depends on a woman’s history of choices, outcomes, and policy environments. The competitive effect enters the structural model in a reduced-form way, whereby abortion policy can have direct effects on the probability of partnership offers and can shift preferences for sex outside of the insurance effect channel. Amador (2014) is the first paper to estimate a structural model that includes the abortion decision, but the relationship between partnership markets and abortion policy and that a woman may have more information about partnerships post-conception are not modeled, and sexual activity is treated as exogenous. Amador (2014) develops a method for correcting for underreporting of abortion in survey data, which I apply a variant of in my estimation procedure, and also includes a labor supply decision, which I do not.====Simulations from the structural model allow me to decompose the total effects of parental consent laws on fertility and partnership into the impacts from each of the theoretical mechanisms. When parental consent laws are removed, the price effect leads to an increase in abortions among pregnant minors and the insurance effect leads to a small increase in pregnancies. A portion of the additional pregnancies result in births via information effects, however this increase in births pales in comparison to the decrease in births that stems from the price effect. Further, the portion of new pregnancies that end in birth are not primarily being shifted from abortion to birth as a result of ==== information, which suggests that it may be profitable for future research to consider the other forms of uncertainty that play a role in abortion decisions. Finally, removing parental consent laws decreases partnership opportunities for pregnant minors through the competitive effect. This decrease in partnership opportunities for pregnant minors creates an incentive to avoid pregnancy, which works against the insurance effect and ultimately leads to a prediction that removing parental consent laws could decrease pregnancies overall. The decrease in partnership opportunities for pregnant minors also slightly increases the probability that a pregnancy is aborted and increases the percent of births that are to single and cohabiting women. Taken together, the effects of removing parental consent laws on behavior lead to a decrease in pregnancies, an increase in abortions, and a decrease in births, especially to single women. The price effect and competitive effect together result in the percent of births to single women decreasing, the percent of births to cohabiting women increasing, and the percent of births to married women decreasing.====Simulations also allow me to consider the life-cycle effects of parental consent laws, as well as a counterfactual scenario where abortion is banned. Parental consent laws are shown to have economically meaningful effects on total fertility, the probability of being a single or unwed mother, marriage rates, and school attendance over the life-cycle. For women who experience a pregnancy as a teenager, removing parental consent requirements would reduce the average number of children by roughly 10 percent and increase average years of school by roughly 1.2 percent by age 28. I also use the model to consider the most extreme form of cost change: an abortion ban that removes abortion from the choice set for all pregnant women at all ages. Importantly, because competitive effects are modeled in a reduced-form way, the results from the counterfactual abortion ban simulation must be interpreted as the effects of a ban assuming no effects on competition in the market for partners. Another caveat to the abortion ban simulation is that many argue that the legalization of abortion led to a shift in social or cultural norms surrounding sex and partnership, which a model that assumes policy-invariant preference parameters is ill-equipped to capture. However, given those caveats, the results from the counterfactual abortion ban simulation suggest that a ban on abortion would reduce pregnancies by 7 percent, while having large impacts on birth rates and total fertility. By age 28, the model predicts that an abortion ban would increase average number of children by 0.266 or 28 percent. Among those women who would abort a pregnancy in the baseline, an abortion ban decrease average schooling by 0.4 years or 2.6 percent.====It is important to recognize that this research focuses on a more recent time period than the period in which abortion was legalized. Many things, including social perceptions of single motherhood and sex outside of partnership, could be vastly different during the 1997 to 2011 period than during the early 1970s. Further, the change in the cost of abortion that came with legalization was presumably much greater than the costs that state-level restrictions create. Therefore, while the results in this paper can teach us about the role of abortion policy in the decision-making environment for more recent cohorts of women, one should be very cautious in using these results to make inferences about the impacts of abortion legalization on family structure in the decades following legalization.====The paper proceeds as follows.

However, such tax exemptions may also have negative equilibrium effects. The German minijob tax exemption offers a convenient case to identify equilibrium effects as it applies to some but not to other low-wage jobs. We build and estimate a structural job search model with discontinuous taxes on German administrative data. Counterfactual policy simulations highlight distributional consequences of reforming the tax exemption. We find that 1.99 million individuals only participate in the labor market due to the tax exemption. A budget-neutral removal of the tax subsidy hurts these workers (e.g. retirees, students), but benefits those who seek small jobs independently of the tax exemption. Furthermore, a removal would result in greater variance in equilibrium wages, benefiting workers who search more (those without another job) at the cost of workers searching less (e.g. those seeking a second job).","Labor market policies around the world attempt to remove barriers for workers with low earnings potential to join the labor market. In the US and UK, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Working Family Tax Credit have been prominent programs (see Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001), Blundell (2000) and Bargain and Orsini (2006)). These programs reduce the cost of labor for low incomes by reducing taxes and other compulsory contributions. The expansion of such tax exemptions has come with increasing awareness of potential negative side effects (e.g. Bargain et al. (2010)). In Germany, jobs with earnings below a certain threshold, so-called minijobs, are exempt from both income tax and compulsory social security contributions (SSC). Side effects of tax exemptions can be split into two types. First, firms and workers might decide to reduce hours of work and/or wages for workers eligible to benefit from the policy. Second, if there are equilibrium effects, individuals beyond those directly targeted by the policy are also affected. Chetty et al. (2011) show that if firms cannot easily change the number of hours of a posted job offer, they have an incentive to package their hours-wage bundles according to average preferences of job-seeking workers. Since the same jobs were eligible for tax reduction for one group but not another in the German system of minijob tax exemption we study here, identification of the role of firm responses is particularly intuitive. This paper sets up and empirically estimates a simple equilibrium job search model with a discontinuous tax schedule in order to evaluate wage, hours and participation effects and study welfare consequences of the German minijob policy for different workers.====The German setting is well-suited for an empirical application of our equilibrium job search model: Throughout the period of analysis (1999–2002), tax exemptions in Germany were awarded to workers in minijobs only if workers did not hold a second job. Employees who held a minijob as a second job were not covered by the policy at all. While the impact of the policy on the earnings distribution of small jobs (defined throughout as a job with earnings up to €800) is less marked for them than for directly affected workers, we find indisputable bunching at the tax exemption threshold for both groups. Studying workers whose budget set is not directly affected by the tax policy allows us to identify the equilibrium effects of tax subsidies: For workers not subject to the minijob tax exemption, changes in hours and wages result only due to equilibrium effects. We estimate our model using a combination of German administrative and household survey data. We find that the minijob tax exemption provokes significant firm reactions. With our estimated structural model we then simulate different counterfactual policies. We quantify the effect of the tax exemption by comparing the situation with a labor market with a smooth tax schedule. These simulations confirm the costs of discontinuous tax policies but also highlight how firm reactions interact with search frictions to influence different workers differentially. We make three main contributions.====First, our unique institutional setting allows for a particularly convincing identification of equilibrium effects. Tax subsidies offered to certain workers with low earnings end up affecting many other workers in the labor market. We estimate our equilibrium job search model and quantify these distorting effects. We thereby complement work discussing unintended equilibrium consequences of making work pay policies (Kolm, Tonin, 2011, Leigh, 2010, Rothstein, 2010) as well as firms’ role in responses to tax reforms in general (Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2006), and bunching in particular (Best, 2014, Chetty, Friedman, Olsen, Pistaferri, 2011, Gudgeon, Trenkle, 2019). Tazhitdinova (2020) also analyzes the German minijob policy. She proposes using the observed bunching to estimate labor supply elasticities. This approach focuses on hours responses of individuals who ==== their earnings due to the tax exemption. It does not allow for an estimation of the increase in employment due to the minijob tax exemption - this participation margin appears to be an important policy objective however.==== We structurally estimate the relative importance of participation and hours margins, and find participation effects to be large, with over one third of minijobs held by individuals who would have zero earnings (rather than higher earnings) without the tax exemption.====Second, we include discontinuous taxes into a standard equilibrium job search model (Shephard (2017) includes continuous taxes). In line with the bunching literature (Saez, 2010), we find important additional welfare costs caused by the discontinuous nature of taxes. We show that these are further increased by firm responses and moderated by search frictions. In contrast to previous equilibrium job search models, we are able to rationalize discontinuous bunching at tax thresholds in the interior of the earnings distribution. We are thus able to analyze counterfactual policy reforms that aim at removing the welfare costs induced by tax non-linearities.====Third, we empirically analyze gains and losses of a tax exemption directly affecting millions of German workers. We show how alternative tax policies could increase different groups’ - and overall - welfare. Search frictions are found to be an important determinant of welfare effects across different groups of workers.====Our model is related to evaluations of tax policies based on analyses of labor supply as a discrete choice (specifically for minijobs, see Arntz et al. (2003) and Bargain et al. (2010)). Given that they lack an equilibrium framework, the wage distribution is typically taken as given. The evidence of equilibrium responses is a strong indication that individuals cannot freely choose hours, however. The models most similar to ours thus include restrictions on the free choice of hours (e.g. Van Soest et al. (1990), Bloemen (2008), Beffy et al. (2018)). Job search models provide a way of explaining some of these constraints on hours without resorting to ad-hoc restrictions on the set of labor supply choices available to individuals. A different strand of the literature has investigated the reason for the divergence between labor supply elasticities based on individual-level data from that based on more aggregate data. Chetty et al. (2011) present a simple model of firms reacting to workers’ tax incentives and argue that firm responses may be a key to explaining “micro versus macro elasticities”,==== but refrain from estimating a structural search model. Their model would also be difficult to fit to the data as it generates no wage dispersion and only focuses on the intensive margin. The German tax exemption importantly affects the extensive margin however - a margin policy-makers are very often concerned with when implementing labor market policies for low-earnings groups. We here present a model that rationalizes the same mechanism in a way that allows estimation and welfare analysis of an important policy for promoting low-wage workers.====Section 2 characterizes the market for small jobs in Germany.

Focusing on labor-intensive activities, the total amount of gig work performed by U.S. household heads in 2015 was equivalent to 3.77 million full-time jobs, of which 20 percent came from online work. We also find that this nonstandard work is partly hidden: over 15 percent of non-retired gig workers would get classified as not in the labor force, 5 percent would get classified as unemployed, and the full-time employment rate would increase significantly if informal hours are fully counted.","According to recent survey measures of nonstandard work arrangements—also known as the gig economy—roughly 30 percent of American adults or household heads engage in informal “gig” work as either a primary or secondary source of income. The estimated participation rate is quite similar across several surveys, despite the fact that each uses a somewhat different definition of gig work.====Although a variety of recent measures indicate that a large share of adults or household heads participates in the gig economy in some fashion, the aggregate amount of gig work performed in the United States has not been quantified. Estimates of gig economy participation along the extensive margin alone could provide a misleading sense of the aggregate economic significance of gig work, especially if it is assumed that all participants engage full-time in gig work. Instead, recent studies examining income from gig work, along with our own previous findings, suggest that most gig employment represents a secondary source of income rather than a primary source (Collins et al., 2019; Bracha and Burke 2014; Robles and McGee 2016). Therefore, a more accurate and meaningful assessment of the gig work phenomenon requires having measures of gig participation along both the extensive and intensive margins. Using our Survey of Informal Work Participation (SCE-SIWP, or SIWP for short), this paper is the first to estimate the aggregate significance of the gig economy using measures of hours worked among gig workers together with measures of participation rates. As online or platform-based gig work (hereafter “online gig work”) is likely to become increasingly common, it is especially important to assess the specific contribution of gig work that makes use of these technologies. We therefore decompose our measures of informal work between online gig work and offline gig work.====Another open question regarding the measurement of gig work is how much of it is missing from official measures of employment, labor force participation, and hours. Our survey is nearly unique in permitting an assessment of this “hidden margin” of informal work, as it elicits labor force status and hours using questions taken from the Current Population Survey (CPS) in addition to probing for gig work participation, gig hours, and gig income. Accordingly, this paper is among the first to assess potential distortions in official employment statistics—including the labor force participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the part-time employment rate—due to the failure of the CPS to fully capture gig work along either the extensive or the intensive margin. The only other study we are aware of that estimates misclassification of informal workers in the CPS is Abraham and Amaya (2019). However, their survey did not probe for informal work hours, and their survey-takers consisted entirely of users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online work platform, a selected group whose behaviors and survey responses with respect to informal work may not be indicative of patterns in the general population. Instead, our survey covers a broad set of informal workers and also allows us to isolate the distortions to employment statistics contributed by online gig work in particular.====Based on our survey, we estimate that as of 2015 roughly 32.5 percent of U.S. household heads qualify as gig workers according to our broadest criteria (described below),==== very close to other comparable measures in the literature. Considering only labor-intensive informal activities, we find that 18.5 percent of household heads are classified as gig economy workers, performing an average of 26 h per month of such work and earning an average of $413 per month. Combining our estimates of participation and hours, among household heads the aggregate amount of gig work completed per month is roughly equivalent to the monthly work of 3.77 million full-time employees. The latter figure amounts to 4.9 percent of the total number of employed household heads in the U.S. as of 2015.==== While the labor-intensive online gig workers represent 30.5 percent of all labor-intensive gig workers, they contribute just 20.5 percent of the FTEs.====The responses to our survey also indicate that the CPS most likely fails to fully capture nonstandard work. Among non-retired respondents who classify as unemployed based on their responses to questions taken from the CPS, about 29 percent report engaging in labor-intensive gig work, as do 16 percent of those who classify as not in the labor force (NILF) under the CPS. As argued below, most or even all of these individuals should qualify as employed under the CPS. Treating all labor-intensive gig workers as employed (except those who say they are retired), the U.S. employment rate in 2015 would have been 4 percentage points higher than the rate indicated by the CPS, and the labor force participation rate would have been 3 points higher.====Isolating the contribution of online (labor-intensive) gig workers to the simulated changes in the participation and unemployment rates, we find that the changes are much smaller—about 1 percentage point in either one of these rates. These smaller discrepancies indicate that online gig workers are less likely to be misclassified as non-employed under the CPS questions. This is consistent with evidence from our survey suggesting that online gig workers are more likely to have a traditional job: a greater share of them report being employed full-time, they report higher average hours in their main job, and they are more likely to cite “earning extra money on top of regular pay” as a reason for engaging in informal work.====We also find evidence suggesting that the CPS understates the full-time employment rate by a significant margin, due to missed informal work hours. These findings may arise because gig work is performed sporadically, and/or because individuals may not think of it as work. To capture such work arrangements, the CPS might add questions designed specifically to determine whether individuals engage in gig work, either as a primary or secondary income source, and/or to ask about work done in the previous month (rather than week) that is expected to continue.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the SIWP is described in detail in Section 2, the main results are in Section 3, Section 4 discuss robustness checks, and Section 5 concludes.","How Big is the Gig?

I argue technology only partially automates these, simplifying them so that they can be performed by less-skilled workers. Thus, post-automation costs include technology and low-wage workers to use it. The minimum wage raises these costs, lowering the profitability of automation and slowing the adoption of routine-replacing technologies. I test this claim using new cross-state variation in the minimum wage (induced by state price differences) and new cross-industry variation in the importance of low-skilled labor for technology (measuring using the Current Population Survey Computer Use Supplement and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles). Because low-skilled workers are needed alongside technology, I show that a low minimum wage increases the automation of routine jobs.","The last 40 years have seen dramatic shifts in the wage distributions of many countries. It is now well-accepted that much of this is due to the impacts of computer technology. Computers specialize in performing repetitive, routine tasks (Autor, Levy, and Murnane, 2003), which have traditionally been concentrated in middle-wage jobs (Goos and Manning, 2007). As a result, increased computer availability has “hollowed out” the wage distribution (Autor, Dorn, 2013, Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014, Michaels, Natraj, Van Reenen, 2014). The core idea is that increasingly affordable computers perform routine tasks, reducing the need for the medium-skilled workers traditionally specialized in these jobs. In this paper, I argue for a modest reformulation of the “computerization” of the labor market (to use Autor, Levy, and Murnane’s terminology). I then test its most direct policy implication, which differs from the traditional theory.====My hypothesis builds on the observation that many (not all) transformative technologies still require some level of human oversight. Computers handle complex calculations, but can rarely perform work tasks completely independently. Humans are often still needed to enter inputs (e.g., enter a customer’s information so that a computer can look up relevant records or make calculations), read the outputs (e.g., tell customers about the results), and physically do what the computer says (e.g., actually getting the product from the warehouse location identified by the computer). Even in the extreme case of industrial robots, humans often must still be ready to hit the emergency stop button and make sure small machine errors do not compound during production. Instead of completely replacing workers, technologies often reduce the skills required of workers to perform these tasks. Machines may simplify a job but typically they still need ==== to operate them.====Consider, for example, material recording and production clerks, who work in warehouses to “keep track of information in order to keep businesses and supply chains on schedule. They ensure proper scheduling, recordkeeping, and inventory control.” (All descriptions come from the Department of Labor Occupation Outlook Handbook [OOH].) Thirty years ago, this required a well-organized individual to manage complex filing systems and coordinate dozens of incoming and outgoing shipments each day. Today, software handles these complexities, and the OOH notes that materials recording clerks “increasingly use tablets and other handheld computers.” Modern clerks scan incoming shipments and read out the tablet output directing workers where to move the contents. Still, someone needs to do this task. As another example, statistical clerks “compile data and tabulate statistics for use in statistical studies... [and] tabulate statistics using adding machine and calculator.” Certainly Microsoft Excel has simplified these tasks so that a much wider range of workers can perform them. Alternatively, consider the thousands of photographic process workers in the economy over the 1990’s and 2000’s. These workers develop, process, and print photographs, and many are employed in pharmacies (a very different occupation from photographer). In the days of darkrooms, this required careful light restrictions, chemical blends, and complicated projection equipment. Compared to this, printing digital photography is simple. Although technology has simplified these jobs, they have not disappeared. In fact, during the rapid periods of technological transformation during the 1980’s and 1990’s, they showed virtually no change in employment, although they increasingly employed less-skilled workers. One explanation is that fully-automated robots are not yet available to do these jobs, but technological simplification allows less-skilled workers to do them, which I call technology-enabled deskilling.====If computers need an operator then the cost of technology adoption is not simply the cost of the equipment itself but also the cost of less-skilled labor to operate it. While the declining price of computer equipment has received considerable attention (Nordhaus, 2007), I focus on how the price of low-wage labor affects technology adoption decisions. Because low-skilled workers are an input into computerized production, I show that a high minimum wage can ==== the automation of routine, middle-wage jobs.====I begin by formalizing these ideas in a simple nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution model. Because low-skilled computer users are a complement to computer capital (with the composite being a substitute for medium-skilled routine workers), I show that raising the minimum wage can reduce technology adoption and raise medium-skilled workers’ employment. I then test the predictions of the model in the United States for the period 1980-2005. To measure firms’ shift towards more technology-based production of routine tasks (rather than the traditional approach using medium-skilled workers), I follow my model and use the employment of high-skilled IT workers. Below I discuss several advantages of this approach relative to using measures of computer capital, and one of them is that it allows me to characterize production among thousands of industry-state cells. This facilitates an identification strategy that exploits state variation in the minimum wage and industry variation. The core idea behind identification is to recognize that not all industries have equal need for low-skilled computer users as they shift towards technology-based production. I treat industries where such computer users are unnecessary as control industries, and use this to estimate the effects of the minimum wage.====For cross-state variation I derive novel, useful variation in the minimum wage induced by state price differences. For cross-industry variation, I measure the share of low-skilled workers (defined by education and wages) who directly use a computer at work (based on the Current Population Survey Computer Use Supplement) and the share in an occupation where tasks would benefit from a computer (based on the Dictionary of Occupational Titles). As I show below, industries differ dramatically in the extent to which low-skilled workers are employed in these “computer user” type positions, and I call this the degree of ==== of technology in the industry.====With both cross-state and cross-industry variation, I employ an identification strategy that explicitly estimates the differential effect of the minimum wage in industries with highly labor-dependent technology, essentially using industries where low-skilled labor is irrelevant for computers as control industries. By focusing on the interaction between the minimum wage and industry level labor-dependency, this strategy allows me to include state-year fixed effects, substantially alleviating controversial identification assumptions in past minimum wage research. I discuss the advantages of my strategy below, as well as key measurement issues.====I find that industries that often use low-skilled computer attendants tend to hire fewer information and technology (IT) workers when the real minimum wage is high (compared to other industries). I interpret this as suggesting that the labor-dependence of computer technology leads to slower technology adoption in these industries when the minimum wage is high. I estimate that a $1 decrease in the minimum wage causes a 30% increase in employment of very high-skilled IT workers and a .9 percentage point decline in the routine share of the wage bill, both relative to a counterfactual where low-skilled workers do not use computers. Both conclusions are based on specifications using state-year fixed effects to account for time-varying state-specific confounds affecting all industries equally. Though these results are based on cross-industry comparisons, I discuss the assumptions under which they apply to the aggregate economy.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the most relevant literature. Section 3 provides descriptive evidence to support my argument, and Section 4 develops a simple conceptual framework.

We find that higher rank in math increases the likelihood of choosing STEM and decreases the likelihood of choosing Arts and Social Sciences. Similarly, a higher rank in English leads to an increase in the probability of choosing Arts and Social Sciences and decreases the probability of choosing STEM. The effects of subject ranks on STEM are larger for boys than girls while there is no evidence of a ==== in the effect of subject ranks on Arts and Social Sciences. We also find that English and math rank can explain about 4% of the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major and 9% of the gender gap that is not explained by absolute achievement. Overall, the tendency for girls to be higher ranked in English and lower ranked in math within school-cohorts can explain about 10% of the difference in the STEM gender gap between mixed-sex schools and same-sex schools and about 25% of the difference that is unexplained by absolute achievement. Notably, these effects occur even though we control for an extensive set of measures of absolute achievement at the end of high school, and the institutional setup implies that within-school rank plays no role whatsoever in college admissions decisions.","The choice of college major is one of the most important decisions made by young people and can have a great impact on later earnings in the labor market (Altonji et al., 2016). It is well established that academic preparation and student interests are predominant determinants of college major choice – students tend to enter fields that they enjoy and in which they are likely to do well. However, recent research has found that, in addition to absolute skills and achievement, relative class rank in school matters for human capital accumulation and for educational behavior. In this paper, we use Irish data to investigate whether, conditional on achievement at the end of high school, rank in English and math affects choice of college major. Given its importance to the economy and its large gender gap, we place particular emphasis on whether higher rank in math and lower rank in English causes high school students to be more likely to choose Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields in college.====There are two major motivations for our study. First, many papers have studied the role of comparative advantage (in particular, in math and English) in determining college major.==== However, little work has considered whether students additionally consider their within-school rankings in math and English when making choices. Students may lack information about their academic ability (Zafar, 2011; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2012, 2014; Bobba and Frisancho, 2014) and this uncertainty may lead students to infer their comparative advantage across subjects from their rank across subjects in school.==== While relative achievement is informative, it can also lead students astray if the distribution of achievement in their class is not typical. If ordinal rank is important, it could motivate policy interventions to provide information to school students about their absolute achievement level. Second, women are still greatly underrepresented in STEM college programs with serious implications for gender earnings gaps (Card and Payne, 2017).==== Previous research has found that this is partly due to female comparative advantage in English compared to math (Speer, 2017; Card and Payne, 2017; Delaney and Devereux, 2019; Breda and Napp, 2019; Aucejo and James, 2019). However, relatively little is known about whether the STEM gender gap can be further explained by the tendency for women to be higher ranked within-school in English and lower ranked within-school in math than men.====In this paper, we study whether rank in math and English affects college major decisions, after controlling for multiple measures of achievement and academic interests at the end of high school. There are several reasons why math and English ranks may affect college major choices. Students may develop confidence in a particular area of study from a higher class rank or despondence from a lower one.==== The advice students obtain from peers, teachers, or family members about college major choice may depend on school-cohort rank in math and English.==== Also, students may be uncertain about their ability and so may rely on rank to infer ability and comparative advantage across subjects.====While the recent rank literature has found strong impacts of class rank on many outcomes including earnings, high school graduation, college enrollment, and risky behavior (Murphy and Weinhardt, 2020; Denning et al., 2018; Elsner and Isphording, 2017, 2018), there has been little focus on the relationship between rank in English and math in high school and choice of college major. Using UK data, Murphy and Weinhardt (2020) find that students who are ranked higher in a subject in primary school are more likely to complete that subject at A-Level. However, they do not examine rank at the end of high school or the choice of college major. Denning et al. (2018), using data from Texas, find that math rank in 3==== grade has a positive effect on doing a STEM major in college; however, they do not consider the effects of rank at the end of high school.==== Elsner et al. (2019) find that rank within teaching sections in a Dutch university affects subsequent choice of courses. However, their focus is on different choices within the field of business rather than across very distinct fields.====We add to the literature in several ways. First, our focus differs from these papers in that, rather than studying the effect of rank at early ages on much later choices, we abstract from rank effects on exam grades and examine the effects of rank on preferences for college choices at the end of high school, conditional on absolute performance at the end of high school. We have grades for each of the 7 or 8 subjects taken in the Leaving Certificate examinations. These high-stakes exams are centrally set and graded and so are comparable across all students. They provide a detailed description of academic readiness at the end of high school and allow us to control for absolute achievement in a variety of subjects as well as for academic interests as revealed by high school subject choices. Thus, we can isolate the effect of math and English ranks on student choices, conditional on their academic interests and achievements.====Second, our data include preference rankings over college majors for all high school students who apply for college and, if relevant, the program accepted. Thus, we can study desired college program of study for all persons who consider college, not just for the sample who actually attend. As such, we can see how math and English ranks affect desired college major for all applicants. Third, compared to the U.S., there are several features of the Irish system that make it conceptually easier to study the effects of high school rank on college choices. Unlike in the US, college admission decisions are never influenced by class rank but are predominantly determined by Leaving Certificate points that are solely based on scores in the student's best 6 subjects. Also, both English and math are compulsory subjects throughout high school so we can calculate within-school ranks in these for all students who apply to college. Finally, we add to the literature on the gender gap in STEM. In mixed-sex schools girls tend to be lower ranked in math and higher ranked in English than boys. We examine whether these differential ranks in English and math by gender have explanatory power for the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major and for the larger gender gap in STEM in mixed-sex schools compared to same-sex schools.====We find that, conditional on achievement at the end of high school, within school-cohort percentile rank in English and math is predictive for field choice, particularly for STEM and Arts and Social Sciences – higher English rank is positively associated with choosing Arts and Social Sciences and negatively with STEM; higher math rank is positively associated with STEM and negatively with Arts and Social Sciences. Notably, these effects occur even though we control for an extensive set of measures of absolute achievement at the end of high school, and the institutional setup implies that within-school rank plays no role whatsoever in college admissions decisions. Subject ranks have some explanatory power for the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major in mixed-sex schools – the tendency for girls to be higher ranked in English and lower ranked in math within school-cohorts can explain about 4% of the STEM gender gap in mixed-sex schools and about 10% of the difference in the STEM gender gap between mixed-sex schools and same-sex schools.====The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next section, we describe the institutional background and data, and, in Section 3, we describe the empirical methodology. In Section 4, we present our main results. Section 5 outlines a set of robustness checks. Section 6 shows that our estimates can help explain the gender gap in STEM.

I use experimental evidence to examine individuals’ decisions to attend and participate in a job fair. Thirteen percent of invited but unsubsidized respondents attend the job fair, and they are positively selected from the overall distribution of respondents. While the subsidy attracts those who are less qualified and less confident in their ability to find work abroad, the least qualified do not search intensively. Although the subsidy does not lead to any additional offers, it induces individuals with a high degree of uncertainty about their likelihood of job-finding to apply with recruitment agencies. These results demonstrate the importance of imperfect information about the returns to search and highlight how reducing search costs can increase search effort among those most uncertain about their prospects.","Labor market frictions generated by high search costs can lead to higher rates of non-participation and worse-quality matches between firms and workers (MacMinn, 1980, McCall, 1970). These costs, and their impacts, are often heterogeneous across populations, affecting those who are geographically remote or credit constrained in particular (Abebe et al., 2020). However, search costs are not necessarily harmful; they could help screen out unqualified or uninterested candidates, as Kuhn and Skuterud (2004) and Hadass (2004) find in internet job search and as Alatas et al. (2016) find in the realm of social protection programs. Understanding the empirical correlates of job-search decisions is important in order to understand the potentially heterogeneous nature of search costs and labor market frictions. Additionally, understanding who responds to reduced search costs, and how that affects program effectiveness more broadly, has important implications for determining optimal recruitment strategies by firms, as well as for labor market program design (Heckman and Smith, 2004)====This paper examines the determinants of job-search decisions and the role of search costs on selection into search. I ask, how do individuals’ backgrounds and perceptions affect their job-search decisions, and how does incentivizing search affect these determinants? I consider the decision to look for work abroad in the rural Philippines, where the overseas labor market is large but job search is costly. I combine survey data from 860 individuals ages 20–35 with a novel dataset of overseas labor demand to measure how the perceived benefits and costs to search, based on individuals’ qualifications, labor-market perceptions, and past exposure to the overseas labor market, affect their decisions to attend and apply for work at a nearby job fair for overseas work. Job and career fairs are commonly used by employers across both developed and developing countries (Chang, 2009, Abebe et al., 2018), and they are a popular means of recruitment in the Philippines for both domestic and overseas positions (Esguerra et al., 2001).====I experimentally reduce search costs by offering individuals from randomly selected neighborhoods a modest incentive to attend this nearby job fair. Specifically, they receive a gift certificate to a local fast-food restaurant conditional on job-fair attendance. The randomized incentive to attend a job fair reduces search costs relative to respondents’ outside option by offsetting the time and transportation costs of attending. I show that the cash value of the voucher is greater than the estimated time costs of traveling to the fair for most participants.==== Although its value is not perfectly fungible, it will, at a minimum, offset the cost of one meal for approximately four people. Because all respondents are invited to the fair, it should not play an informational role. The incentive is similar in spirit to door prizes or giveaways that employers or coordinating organizations commonly used to entice job-seekers to attend job and career fairs.====The survey team hosted this fair in partnership with the municipality, and it attracted more than 750 participants, roughly 30 percent of whom were survey respondents. Enumerators tracked individuals’ attendance and participation at the job fair, including interviews with employers and their outcomes, and I matched this administrative data with survey responses to compare the characteristics of those who search with and without the subsidy and to compare how those who stay and participate in the fair differ from those who leave immediately after retrieving their incentive.====Under standard job-search models, individuals will look for work if the expected benefits exceed the expected costs. Those with higher expected benefits from working abroad are more likely to attend the fair, which could include individuals who are more qualified for overseas work or who are more likely to successfully deploy overseas conditional on receiving a job offer. However, more-qualified workers may also have higher opportunity costs of searching and migrating, inducing negative selection on qualifications and education levels. Ultimately, the distribution of underlying relative returns to search, which reflect qualification levels, individuals’ outside options, and the costs of search, will determine the overall pattern of selection (Borjas, 1987, Roy, 1951). The presence of imperfect information further complicates selection into job search if individuals’ perceived returns to searching do not reflect their actual returns. Individuals may over- or underestimate their own qualifications, or they may be highly uncertain about their prospects (Diagne, 2010, Falk, Huffman, Sunde, 2006a, Falk, Huffman, Sunde, 2006b). Consequently, labor market perceptions may directly play an important role in the decision to search for work.====I expect that incentivizing attendance should bring more people to the job fair, but heterogeneous search costs mean that incentives also may affect selection into search, with the net impact ultimately depending on the relationship between search costs and ability (Abebe et al., 2020). Additionally, the impact on actual applications is potentially ambiguous, as it also will depend on the costs and benefits of applying conditional on attendance.====Among my study sample, 13 percent attend a job fair for overseas work. Of those, 79 percent apply and roughly 50 percent are invited for a final interview. These individuals are positively selected not only in terms of their qualifications for work, but also in their perceived likelihood of job-finding. However, perceived wages are not an important predictor of attendance or participation. A randomly assigned incentive dramatically increases attendance regardless of underlying qualifications, but the least qualified leave immediately after receiving their incentive, preventing potential crowd-out during the fair. Only those who are highly uncertain about their overseas job prospects stay to apply for work, indicating that the marginal applicant may use job search as a tool to learn about his or her own labor market prospects. In aggregate, however, the incentive does not increase the number of final interview offers.====This paper uses data from the same experiment described in Beam (2016), although the two papers differ in their temporal and topical focus. Beam (2016) examines the impact of job-fair attendance on employment outcomes and labor-market perceptions in the months following the fair, using randomized voucher assignment to instrument for attendance. That paper finds that while attending a job-fair does not lead to overseas migration, it does affect how individuals look for work. Specifically, attendance increases the likelihood of looking for work outside the region and being employed in the formal sector in the months following the fair, indicating that job fairs may help job-seekers learn about their labor market prospects. It also discusses the impact of providing information about overseas wages and about qualifications for overseas work, which affect individuals’ labor market perceptions but not their labor market outcomes.====In contrast, this paper unpacks that initial decision of ==== to attend a job fair. Specifically, I focus on examining selection into attendance and participation and how reducing search costs with an incentive affects that selection into search. I also expand the set of predictors beyond standard characteristics like age and education by including labor-market perceptions, estimated search costs, and a proxy measure of qualifications for overseas work.====This paper joins a growing literature on the causal impact of reducing job-search frictions. Transportation subsidies increase the number of job matches (Phillips, 2014, Abebe et al., 2018), and Abebe et al. (2020) find that incentivizing job applications leads to higher employment, particularly from those more likely to be credit constrained or face high search costs. Conversely, subsidizing job search in South Africa led to no change in employment or wages (Banerjee and Sequeira, 2020), and a job-matching program in Jordan effectively yielded no matches (Groh et al., 2015). In the more general realm of program participation, Duflo and Saez (2003) find that incentivizing employee attendance at a retirement savings plan enrollment fair yields large increases in attendance, but those induced to attend are no more likely to enroll.====Additionally, this paper contributes to the literature on subjective expectations about labor-market prospects. These expectations play an important role in job-search and migration decisions (Diamond, 1982, Harris and Todaro, 1970, Mortensen, Pissarides, 1994, Sjaastad, 1962). Biases in expectations have been documented across multiple contexts and tend to be particularly strong in developing countries, where labor market frictions can be high (Arcidiacono, Hotz, Kang, 2012, Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2014, Jensen, 2010, Nguyen, 2008, Banerjee, Sequeira). I find that the perceived likelihood of job-finding, as opposed to wage expectations, is particularly important in the decision to look for work. This complements McKenzie et al. (2013), who find that (male) potential Tongan migrants underestimate the likelihood of employment and wages they would earn, and Baseler (2020), who finds that families underestimate domestic migrant earnings. However, unlike McKenzie et al. (2013), who find that expected earnings are associated with higher migration application rates, I find that only the perceived likelihood of job-finding matters for the decision to search.",Search costs and the determinants of job search,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000038,20 January 2021,2021,Research Article,212.0

To obtain the causal effect, the difference-in-differences method is used based upon a data set of employees nominated for option ownership. Comparing employees who were granted options with those who had only been nominated, we find that the impact of option ownership on employees’ performance is insignificant and results are robust across the board. Moreover, a heterogeneity analysis indicates that the incentive effect exists for employees at high job levels but remains insignificant for workers at low job levels; there is no difference in effect across genders or between high and low education; in addition, whether employees had plans to exercise their options has no impact on the incentive effect.","Employee options are widely used by enterprises, and their use is increasing. In China, about 12% of listed firms issued options to employees (except for top managers) in 2015, and the number increased to 16% in 2019, as shown in Fig. 1. Such popularity is also in the United States (Lazear, 2004; Oyer, 2004; Oyer and Schaefer, 2005). The motivation for issuing employee stock options is often said to be that it gives employees incentive for high productivity. However, such incentive effect is controversial in the existing literature. On the one hand, scholars believe employee options can link the interests of employees to that of enterprises so that the principal-agent problem between enterprises and employees can be solved and employees become more likely to put effort into their work. On the other hand, there are many divergent opinions. First, the free-rider problem in a multi-agent environment weakens the effectiveness of employee options as incentives (Lazear, 2004). Second, the marginal effect of ordinary employees’ efforts on corporate profits is small, so the incentive effect of employee options is too weak to support firms’ broad-based stock option plans (Barron and Waddell, 2003; Oyer, 2004). Therefore, whether the incentive effect of option ownership on employee performance exists is an empirical question that has not yet been answered.====To answer that question, many challenges need to be addressed. Two of the most important challenges to be faced are the availability of data and the endogeneity of option ownership. Although employee options are common in enterprises, the data are usually kept confidential for commercial reasons and remain unavailable to researchers. This makes the empirical evidence of options from employee data scarce. Further, there is an endogenous correlation between option ownership and employee productivity, which might come from either missing variables (such as ability) or reverse causality. This endogenous correlation makes the conclusion of empirical research on the incentive effect of employee options biased and unreliable. However, in this paper, we combine personnel data with option nomination events to solve both challenges, providing the first piece of solid empirical evidence to support the causality research into employee options performance incentives.====This paper analyzes the causal effect of employee options on performance in three steps. The first step is to use option nominations data with the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to analyze whether option ownership has an incentive effect on employee performance. We obtain our data from a large listed firm in China. One of the ways employees acquire options in this firm is through nomination by their departments. To elaborate, departments nominated employees for the Employee Excellence Award based on their performance, and then the firm chose the final prizewinners from the nominees and granted options to them in each year. This process shows that, at least from the perspective of the departments, the nominated employees exhibited similar job performance and were eligible for options. Treating employees who were nominated but did not get options as the control group can reduce the systematic difference between the treatment group and the control group, thus mitigating the endogeneity problem in the regression analysis. Additionally, the data we use are longitudinal panel data, including data before and after an employee received options. The unobservable systematic difference between employees who were granted options and those who were not is further eliminated in the DID method. Through DID regressions, we find that, after the individual fixed effect is controlled, the estimated coefficient of option ownership is insignificant, implying that options have no significant impact on employees’ performance.====Furthermore, through a dynamic analysis of the impact of options, we find that the difference in performance between the treatment group and the control group does not change significantly in the year following the grant of the options. This further confirms that the ownership of options has no significant impact on employees’ performance. Moreover, we classify options by their vesting schedules to explore whether the dynamic effects of option ownership are robust with different option-vesting schedules. The results show that employees with vested options still do not have better performance subsequent to option ownership.====The second step is the robustness check. First, we verify the pre-trend of the DID model in the data. By comparing the time-varying changes in the dependent variables between the treatment group and the control group, we find that there is no significantly different change between the two groups before the treatment group is treated. This indicates that we could not reject the assumption of the parallel trend statistically. Second, to further eliminate the difference between the treatment group and the control group before nominations, we conduct propensity score matching (PSM) to mitigate the endogeneity problem caused by the selective bias in nominations. We find that little difference between the regression coefficients before and after matching, indicating that the basic regression estimation results are robust. Third, we further explore the relationship between the options’ value and employees’ performance. The regression results show that employees’ performance does not change significantly because of the options’ value.====The final step is to analyze the heterogeneity of the incentive effect of employee options. We subdivide the samples by gender, education, job levels and option exercising behavior, and perform a DID regression in the subsamples. The results show that the options have no significant effect on employees’ performance, either in gendered subsamples or in education subsamples. Even in employees with option exercising, the effect of option ownership is still insignificant. Moreover, we find that employee options could significantly improve the performance of employees at high job levels but not at low job levels. Therefore, the insignificant incentive effect of employee options on performance is more likely caused by the subtle marginal impact of low-level employees on the company's performance.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review the previous literature and document our contributions and limitations; in Section 3, we introduce our data; in Section 4, we present the basic empirical results; in Section 5, we conduct the robustness test; in Section 6, we further conduct the heterogeneity analysis; and in Section 7, we provide the conclusion.",The causal effect of option ownership on employee performance: Empirical evidence from personnel data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537121000014,7 January 2021,2021,Research Article,213.0

This paper examines the causal ,"The migration of individuals, either within their origin country or internationally, is a global phenomenon in many low-income and middle-income countries.==== This has resulted in an increasing number of children being left-behind when their parents migrate. For example, the proportion of left-behind children (LBC henceforth) is estimated to be 27% in Philippines, 36% in Moldova and 39% in Georgia (Cebotari, Siegel, Mazzucato, 2018, Cortes, 2015). In China, the number of children left-behind by parents is very large. According to the Sixth Population Census conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2010, the total number of LBC aged below 18 was over 61.03 million, accounting for 37.70% of children in rural areas and 21.88% of all children in China.====An important research question is how the development and well-being of LBC is affected by parental migration. The recent literature suggests that there are two main channels (Griffiths et al., 2018, Wang, 2014). The first pathway is a positive effect associated with increased family income (income effect), which is usually the primary reason for migration. More abundant family resources enable the family to afford more investment in children’s human capital such as education and health. The second is a negative effect due to the lack of parental care and supervision of children within the family (non-presence effect), which is crucial for children’s development. The net effect of parental migration depends on the relative magnitude of the two effects. Many studies have found that parental migration is linked to the worsening of children’s educational achievement (Cortes, 2015, Meyerhoefer, Chen, 2011, Wang, 2014, Zhang, Behrman, Fan, Wei, Zhang, 2014, Zhao et al., 2014, Zhou, Murphy, Tao, 2014), physical health outcomes (de Brauw and Mu, 2011, Li et al., 2015, Murphy, Zhou, Tao, 2016, Nguyen, 2016) and psychological and behavioral well-being (Botezat, Pfeiffer, 2020, Chang et al., 2019, Lahaie, Hayes, Piper, Heymann, 2009, Lu, Yeung, Liu, Treiman, 2019, Murphy, Zhou, Tao, 2016). Therefore, the negative non-presence effect generally dominates the positive income effect in the human capital development of LBC.====Here we focus on rural children whose parents have migrated to work in urban areas in China. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2016), around 277.5 million rural workers were working or looking for jobs in Chinese cities in 2015. The existing institutional restrictions have prevented migrant workers from bringing their children with them when migrating for work in cities. Due to the household registration system (====), rural migrant workers and their families are excluded from full access to social welfare benefits such as pension, subsidized health care and unemployment insurance that are available to local residents in cities (Song, 2014). Migrant children are generally excluded from the public education system because of the ====-based discriminatory educational policy (Chen and Feng, 2013). Therefore, rural–urban migrants often have to leave their children in rural villages. Children who are left behind either live with other family members or enroll in boarding schools, in the absence of parental care and supervision.====In this paper, we analyze the peer effects of LBC on their classmates in rural China. Students’ learning and social interactions generally take place in a class. Specifically, we analyze, in a causal fashion, the spillover effects of the presence of LBC on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates in the same classroom. Our empirical analysis is based on the baseline survey of the China Education Panel Survey conducted during the 2013–2014 academic year, which is a nationally representative survey of students, their parents, teachers and school administrators in China’s middle schools.====A major identification problem is that the potential effect of LBC on their classmates’ mental health may be contaminated by students’ selection into schools. We address this selectivity problem by conditioning on school fixed effects. An additional concern is that, within the same school, there may still be a selectivity issue due to endogenous sorting of students across classes. To circumvent this problem, we restrict our sample to students in schools that place students to classes using random assignment. Our identification strategy is to compare the mental health of non-left-behind students from two classes in the same grade of the same school who have similar characteristics and face the same school environment, except for the fact that one class has a comparatively higher share of LBC than the other due to the random assignment of students to classrooms in each school.====To preview the main findings, our analysis indicates that the presence of LBC has a negative and statistically significant effect on the mental health of non-left-behind children. Specifically, a one-percentage-point increase in the proportion of LBC in class reduces the mental health index of their classmates by 0.017 of a standard deviation. These deleterious effects on mental well-being are similar for grade-seven and grade-nine students. We find little evidence of heterogeneity in the negative peer effects by student gender and school rank. However, the adverse mental health effects are heterogeneous by class size, with the most pronounced impact found among students in big classes. Furthermore, an examination of the mechanisms driving the negative spillover effect on mental health reveals that a higher proportion of left-behind peers leads to the worsening of class climate and peer-to-peer social interactions. However, we find no evidence that students’ academic outcomes are impaired by left-behind peers in the same classroom. Therefore, the negative mental health effects of LBC seem not induced by their classmates’ dissatisfaction with academic progress.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, we provide a novel investigation into the social spillovers of LBC on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates, exploiting random student-classroom assignment within China’s middle schools. In the existing literature, there are only a few studies examining the causal peer effects on mental health.==== Exploiting exogenous variation from roommate assignments, Eisenberg, Golberstein, Whitlock, Downs, 2013 find little evidence on the contagion of mental health among college roommates. Using cross-cohort variation in the share of same-gender peers who are depressed within schools, Giulietti et al. (2020) find a significant peer effect for females but not for males. Kiessling and Norris (2020) exploit within-school cross-cohort variation in student composition and show that a higher relative rank among peers in school improves students’ long-run mental health. Our paper is the first to analyze the peer effects of students of migrating parents on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates. This analysis is important since LBC are common in many developing countries.====Second, we contribute to the literature on external stressors and children’s mental health. Previous studies mainly focus on stress factors such as parental job loss (Bubonya, Cobb-Clark, Wooden, 2017, Schaller, Zerpa, 2020), disruption of family structure (Brown, 2006, Slade, Beller, Powers, 2017), family income declines (Khanam, Nghiem, Rahman, 2020, Milligan, Stabile, 2011) and victimization (Le et al., 2018, Turner et al., 2006). Our study shows that children’s mental stress increases when there is a higher proportion of LBC in the same classroom.====Last, our results contribute to the current policy debates on the socioeconomic benefits and costs of rural–urban migration during the urbanization process of a developing country. Limited to an intergenerational perspective within households, most previous studies have documented negative influences of migrating parents on the education, health and psychosocial development of their LBC in rural areas. This study further shows evidence on the adverse spillover effects of LBC on their peers. Therefore, this study also contributes to the recent literature on spillover effects of disruptive peers (Ahn and Trogdon, 2017, Carrell et al., 2018, Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010, Figlio, 2007). Highlighting that the welfare losses of children resulting from adult population’s migration have been understated, our findings have important policy implications for China and other developing countries experiencing continued migration of adult workers leaving their children behind.====The remaining paper is organized as follows.

A growing trend is for schools to provide a personal laptop or tablet to each pupil for use both in the classroom and at home. The idea behind these one-to-one computer programs (or 1:1 programs) is that information and communication technology (ICT) should be extensively involved in the teaching of all subjects. The aim is partly to improve students’ ICT skills, but the ultimate goal is that they will change teaching practices in a way that will enhance learning in general (Islam and Grönlund 2016). Despite their increasing importance, there is little credible evidence on the causal impact of these programs on students’ educational outcomes, especially from high income countries. The urge to know more about the impact of 1:1 has increased even more due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting school closures and transitions to online schooling in many parts of the world. Online schooling generally presupposes that pupils have access to computers and that teachers integrate computers in their teaching practices.====We study how the use of ICT in teaching affects student outcomes, for the period 2008 to 2016. We do this by investigating how pupils who are given a personal laptop or tablet, rather than having more limited computer access, are affected in terms of performance on standardized tests in mathematics and language at the end of compulsory school. In addition, we examine how 1:1 programs affect students’ progression to a higher level of education. By surveying all lower secondary schools in 26 Swedish municipalities regarding the implementation of 1:1 programs and combining this information with administrative data, we estimate the impact on educational outcomes using a difference-in-differences design. We compare how educational outcomes change across cohorts for schools that launch 1:1 programs, to changes for schools that have not yet introduced such programs.====The theoretical implications of schools’ investments in ICT on student performance are ambiguous: The expenditure a school devotes to ICT will unavoidably come at the expense of other inputs that are likely to affect learning (e.g. the number of teachers or books), and which may be more or less efficient. Similarly, the time that students devote to using technology may come at the expense of other educational activities, which again may be more or less efficient for learning (Bulman and Fairlie 2016).====Several previous studies have estimated the effects of investments in ICT on student achievement using credible empirical strategies (e.g. Angrist and Lavy 2002; Leuven et al. 2007; Banerjee et al. 2007; Machin et al., 2007), with very mixed findings. We review the previous literature in Section 2. However, it is uncertain to what extent the findings from this strand of the literature can be generalized to 1:1 programs, as 1:1 initiatives most likely imply a much more intensive use of ICT in the classroom (as well as at home) compared to the initiatives studied in these papers (Hull and Duch 2018).====Some studies have attempted to estimate effects of 1:1 programs on student outcomes, but the majority are plagued with methodological shortcomings (Hull and Duch 2018; Islam and Grönlund 2016; Zheng et al. 2016). Hitherto, two papers provide more reliable evidence on the impact of 1:1 initiatives. Cristia et al. (2012) study a randomized experiment with a 1:1 program in poor regions of rural Peru and find positive effects on students’ general cognitive skills, but no significant impact on test scores in mathematics or language. It is hard to know whether the findings from this context are relevant for schools in developed countries. For instance, very few of the schools in the sample had access to the internet, which puts major constraints on how the technology could be used. De Melo et al. (2014) provide evidence from a setting that bears somewhat more similarities with ours. They study the national implementation of a 1:1 program in primary schools in Uruguay, exploiting the gradual introduction of the program in order to identify its effects. They also do not find any effects on math or reading scores. However, they also show that the computers were not used that frequently in the classroom. In contrast, survey evidence from the National Agency for Education shows that computers and tablets are highly involved in the teaching in Swedish 1:1 programs (see Section 3).====We contribute to the literature by providing one of the first pieces of evidence on the impact of 1:1 programs from a high income country. Compared to De Melo et al. (2014) we study outcomes at higher ages (lower secondary rather than primary school). While earlier 1:1 studies have focused on short-term impacts (1−2 years) on tests scores, we can follow the students somewhat longer and also examine impacts on their progression to a higher level of education. Specifically, we investigate if exposure to 1:1 programs affects whether students are admitted to upper secondary school and what type of track they enroll in (academic or vocational). This allows us to also capture effects on a broader set of skills compared to merely examining test scores.====Moreover, it is proposed in the literature that 1:1 programs may reduce social inequity by providing computers to pupils with low socio-economic status (SES) (e.g. Zheng et al. 2016). But, to our knowledge, there is no rigorous empirical support for this claim. Access to data on parental background, allows us to directly examine whether 1:1 programs reduce the gap in educational performance between students with different SES backgrounds.====Furthermore, the rich data we have at hand allow us to perform a number of additional analyses to shed light on some potential mechanisms behind our findings: We examine if the costs associated with introducing 1:1 programs have led to larger classes (a proxy for higher student-teacher ratios), and if these programs have affected the sorting of teachers across schools. We also examine if the effects on student performance differ depending on the type of technology used (laptops vs. tablets).====We find no evidence suggesting that 1:1 programs impact average student performance on the standardized tests, the probability of being admitted to upper secondary school, or the choice of educational track. All point estimates are close to zero and the confidence intervals allow us to rule out both medium and large sized improvements on test scores (cf. Kraft 2019). We show that the absence of positive impacts is unlikely to be explained by lower teacher-student ratios or changes in the composition of teachers employed. However, our analysis suggests that 1:1 initiatives may increase inequality in education by worsening math skills and decreasing enrollment college-preparatory programs in upper secondary school among students with lower educated parents.====The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. We start by reviewing the literature on the effects of ICT in education in Section 2. In the subsequent section we describe the Swedish education system and the role of ICT in Swedish schools.

In financing expenditures, shifting a tax burden from labor income to consumption increases the size of a formal sector, enhancing productivity and welfare. Economic and welfare consequences of ","The size of the shadow economy is large across the world. Medina and Schneider (2018) estimate that more than one-third of world GDP is produced in the underground economy.==== In developing regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, over 40% of the economic activities take place informally, and in some countries two-thirds of the economy is underground.====Distinguishing between formality and informality is important in analyzing policies in such an economy. An informal sector, by definition, is characterized by lack of compliance with government regulations. Individuals pay no taxes and make no social security contribution on income earned informally. They are, however, disconnected from public provision of social insurance, despite the fact that workers in the informal sector face higher labor mobility and earnings volatilities and are in need of more insurance.==== Mexico is a prime example of such issues, with a history of attempts to curb informality. Using the data of the Mexican Statistics and Geography National Institute (INEGI), we estimate that 43% percent of the working population is employed in the underground sector.====Workers in the shadow economy face not only lower wages, but also higher risks of job loss and little protection from job dismissals. Policy makers are debating the implementation of an unemployment insurance system, which is far from comprehensive at present. Also debated is a reform of the tax system on consumption and labor income, two major sources of revenues besides oil in Mexico (OECD, 2019). Such changes in labor market and fiscal policies are likely to induce mobility of workers across sectors.====This paper builds a structural life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents in a dual-sector economy, in which workers move between formal and informal sectors and in and out of unemployment. Individuals are heterogeneous in the stage of life-cycle, human capital, wealth, uninsurable idiosyncratic labor productivity and the sector where they currently work. They face uncertainty in employment and productivity, but the market is incomplete and risk-averse individuals engage in life-cycle as well as precautionary savings of riskless assets to smooth consumption. The model is calibrated using various micro data, including the National Urban Employment Survey (ENEU) and the National Employment and Occupational Survey (ENOE) for wage and employment data and the National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH) for asset profile.====We then use the calibrated model to simulate debated labor market policies to quantify effects on wages, employment, savings, and welfare, as well as the reallocation of labor across sectors. We simulate two labor market policies: an introduction of unemployment insurance and the provision of more generous employment protection through higher severance payment.====We allow laid-off workers in the formal sector to collect unemployment benefits for a limited duration. The policy increases the unemployment rate, although the effects are quantitatively small. Hazard rates, however, into formality among insurance recipients decline and the unemployed are more likely to accept offers for informal jobs. Given the lack of monitoring of employment in the informal sector, unemployed individuals who accept a job in the informal sector can keep collecting benefits until the receiving period ends.====A higher severance payment reduces the likelihood of layoffs in the formal sector. The policy, however, also depresses equilibrium formal wages, leaving the unemployment rate and the share of formality almost unchanged. Hazard rates, both into formality and informality, decrease with more severance payments due to wealth effects through larger transfers.====To quantify fiscal costs of alternative policies, we simulate a model implementing the policies under alternative tax regimes, by shifting sources of taxation between labor income and consumption. While consumption taxes are less distortionary than labor income taxes, the change in employment due to higher labor taxes turns out to be surprisingly small. In our dual-sector economy, workers move from formal jobs to informal jobs that remain free of taxes. Such a sectoral reallocation involves a decline in overall productivity and average earnings as well as a sizeable welfare loss of individuals.====Our paper attempts to contribute to different lines of literature. Our model follows the tradition of dynamic structural models populated by heterogenous agents, who optimally choose consumption, saving and labor supply in an incomplete market.==== The model is also a version of the life-cycle framework developed by Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), where individuals accumulate wealth for precautionary and retirement reasons. Using a life-cycle rather than an infinitely-lived agent model helps us approximate the earnings-wealth ratio that is consistent with data of a typical dual economy and the process of accumulating physical and human capital at stages of the life-cycle. We introduce stochastic aging, a modeling device developed by Blanchard (1985), which allows us to reduce the size of individual state space.====The literature has been also merged with and extended to incorporate labor market frictions and to study unemployment dynamics and various labor market policies. The search-island model of Lucas and Prescott (1974) captures search frictions to account for short-run unemployment, which is adopted by papers such as Alvarez and Veracierto (2001) and Kitao et al. (2017). They assume that a worker who finds an island will be randomly matched with a firm and receives a job offer at the equilibrium wage in the island. Alvarez and Veracierto (2001) use the model to study effects of severance payments and Kitao et al. (2017) the roles of transfer policies that interact with decisions of human capital investment and career length in a life-cycle model. Our model also includes frictions in the labor market, as in Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). We let each firm create one job, while being subject to idiosyncratic productivity shocks and endogenous job destruction.====The papers mentioned above focus on a single sector of the economy and one of our major contributions is to extend it to a dual-sector economy in a tractable way. We analyze effects of labor market and fiscal policies in an economy where a large informal sector plays an important role in accounting for dynamics of the labor market, individuals’ welfare and the aggregate economy. Alcaraz et al. (2015) show that although there exists some segmentation in the Mexican labor market, a large number of workers self-select into a particular sector, implying that a structural model needs to capture endogenous mobility of workers across sectors and analysis of policy reforms should take into account their effects on these margins.====Therefore our paper builds on another growing body of literature comprising theoretical and empirical studies on labor market dynamics and policies in an economy with dual sectors. In terms of more theoretical papers, Álvarez-Parra and Sánchez (2009) study the design of unemployment insurance when workers can participate in a hidden labor market and show that the optimal scheme differs significantly from the one prescribed in a market without dual sectors. Cirelli et al. (2019) study optimal design of an unemployment insurance saving accounts (UISA) system in a model with two sectors with savings and their model is perhaps closest to ours among models with informality.==== They find that the optimal UISAs increase welfare, and reduce unemployment and informality due to the incentives for keeping jobs in the formal sector. Both of these papers study optimal design of an unemployment system in more detail than ours, while our analysis has the advantage of incorporating general equilibrium effects.====Levy (2008) studies informality in Mexico and different policy reforms that took place to curb it. The author’s proposal is to eliminate wage-based social security contributions and impose a progressive consumption tax. The results of our paper that lower income taxes and higher consumption taxes reduce informality are broadly consistent with Levy’s proposal, although our experiments are not a perfect mapping to his proposal and therefore not directly comparable. Other authors at the Inter-American Development Bank have also done various empirical research on the effects of tax reforms in countries with high informally. Bernal et al. (2017) study the effect on employment and wages of the switch from payroll taxes to corporate income taxes in Colombia. Lora and Fajardo (2012) analyze the effects of payroll, corporate income and value-added taxes on the labor market for 15 Latin American countries.====Alonso Ortiz and Leal Ordonez (2018) construct a search model of two sectors calibrated to the Mexican data and show that tax and transfer policies have a large impact on the size of the informal sector. Antón (2014) builds a model with endogenous choice of sectors calibrated to the data of Colombia and studies effects of tax reduction on the size of the formal sector. Bobba et al. (2018) estimate a search and matching model of formal and informal labor markets using Mexican data and show that raising taxes may or may not decrease the formal sector and that a comprehensive social security system will reduce the size of the informal sector and raise productivity. Leyva and Urrutia (2019) build a model with business cycles calibrated to the Mexican economy and study effects of informality and labor market regulations on volatility of macroeconomic variables.==== Our innovation in this context is first to allow individuals to accumulate physical and human capital over their life-cycle, which interacts with an individual’s decision about which sectors to work in. Savings of risk-averse individuals adds another key ingredient in evaluating the roles of government-provided insurance through unemployment benefits and severance payments. Second, we consider effects of alternative fiscal policies to finance policy expenditures on labor market dynamics and individuals’ welfare.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

During the Great Recession the unemployment rate increased dramatically, from a pre-recession low of 4.4% in May of 2007 to a high of 10% in October of 2009.==== During this period, young workers, non-white workers, and those with no college education experienced increases in unemployment rates of 7 to 8 percentage points, while prime age, white, and those with some college education saw increases of 4 to 5 percentage points. During both expansions and recessions, the unemployment rates for young workers, non-white workers, and those with no college education are typically twice those of their respective counterpart groups.====A significant literature exists considering whether countercyclical increases in the unemployment rate are due to inflows (e.g. job losses) or outflows (e.g. hiring).==== Recent methodological improvements have led to a consensus of sorts, with outflows appearing to dominate, but with some debate remaining over the relative importance of inflows (e.g., Elsby et al. (2009), Fujita and Ramey (2009), Shimer (2012)). While numerous researchers have investigated the sources of the high unemployment rates for non-whites (Barrett and Morgenstern (1974)), young workers (Clark and Summers (1982), Choi et al. (2015)), and less-educated workers (Nickell (1979), Cairo and Cajner (2018)), it remains an open question whether aggregate flows are similar across demographic groups, or if disadvantaged workers face special challenges.====In order to decompose unemployment rates into component flows for different demographic groups, we extend the methodology of gross flow decomposition. We follow Shimer (2012) by decomposing the unemployment rate into gross flow transition rates. Further, we build on Fujita and Ramey (2009) by decomposing cyclical variation in the unemployment rate into cyclical variation of component flows, with two improvements. First, we extend the two-state decomposition to include transition rates between three states: unemployment, employed, and not-in-the-labor-force. This provides a more-flexible three-state decomposition than Elsby et al. (2015b), which is limited to measuring unemployment fluctuations using the first order log-difference in the unemployment stock.====Second, building on these techniques, we develop a new methodology to decompose the difference in unemployment rates between two groups into the difference in transition rates. This allows us to quantify how much of the differences in unemployment levels can be attributed to differences in each flow between two groups. Although papers such as Elsby et al. (2010) and Cairó and Cajner (2018) consider the unemployment gaps between groups, to our knowledge we are the first to analytically decompose the gap to explicitly measure the relative contributions of component flows.====We use matched monthly CPS data from 1978 through 2017, correcting for misclassification errors following Elsby et al. (2015b) and time aggregation errors following Shimer (2012). We find that the relative importance of the component flows in explaining cyclical unemployment remains consistent across demographic groups, with hiring (UE+IE) always comprising the largest share, movements between unemployment and out of the labor force (UI+IU) the next largest, and separations (EU+EI) the lowest share. In aggregate, we find that 25% of fluctuations are due to the participation margin, slightly smaller than Elsby et al. (2015b).====The magnitudes of these flows, however, differ between groups. For young workers hiring explains 70% of the variation, while for other groups it explains only 50–60%. Further, for dominant groups (white, experienced, with college), separations explain about 20% of the cyclical variation in unemployment, while for non-white and young workers separations only explain about 10%. Thus, due to the greater relative importance of hiring, the reduction in hiring during recessions is especially harmful for disadvantaged groups.====We then decompose the gap in unemployment rates between each disadvantaged group and their respective counterpart, finding that separations are the biggest determinant of the gap in each case, with subtle differences between groups. For non-white workers, hiring is almost as important as separations. For young workers, the gap is entirely driven by separations. For individuals with no college experience, separations explain 80% of the gap.====We next investigate mechanisms driving these gaps. We find that differences in industry and occupation can explain around 60% of the gap in separation rates for young and non-white workers and 75% of the gap in separation rates for workers with no college. We examine the role of voluntary and involuntary separations and conclude that unemployment gaps are primarily driven by involuntary separations.====Finally, using time-use data from the American Time Use Survey and search data from the CPS, we assess whether search effort can explain the cyclical and level differences in hiring between demographic groups. We find that both young and non-white workers are more likely to spend time searching than older and white workers, respectively, while workers with no college are less likely to spend any time searching than college-educated workers. Conditional on spending any time searching, younger workers and those with no college spend less time searching than their counterpart groups, while non-white and white workers show no difference. We find little evidence that disadvantaged workers spend comparatively less time searching during recessions, although the specifications are under-powered. While we cannot measure the returns to search in the ATUS, we construct a proxy based on the time spent interviewing compared to time spent searching. Young workers spend 6% more of their search time interviewing than older workers, while non-white workers spend 5% less time interviewing than white workers.====Thus, although individuals in the three examined disadvantaged groups show similar aggregate unemployment patterns, the mechanisms behind each differ significantly. For non-white workers, the facts that the hiring margin explains almost half of the unemployment gap and that they spend less time interviewing for time searching both suggest that hiring discrimination likely plays a role. This is consistent with experimental evidence on racial discrimination in interview success rates (e.g. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)).====Young workers’ high unemployment rates are entirely driven by high separation rates. Although they have somewhat higher voluntary separation rates, which could be consistent with lifecycle models of job hopping and experimentation, the vast majority of separations are involuntary. These high separation rates are somewhat offset by young workers experiencing greater hiring rates than other demographic groups, but this leaves them especially vulnerable to depressed hiring during recessions.====Finally, for individuals with no college, occupation and industry can explain 3/4 of the gap in the separation rate compared with individuals with college experience. For these workers elevated unemployment rates are largely due to differences in sorting across jobs, although lower search effort could be related to the lower importance of hiring for these workers.====In the online appendix we perform a variety of robustness checks. We show that our flow-decomposition results are robust to alternative divisions of workers by race, age, and education. In addition, we show our results are robust to common alternative specifications.====Our paper contributes to a large literature on flow-decomposition. Most closely related is the work of Elsby et al. (2010), who perform a two-state decomposition on the unemployment rate for different demographic groups, concluding that hiring is the most important cyclical feature for all demographic groups and separations can explain the difference in unemployment rates between groups. We make several methodological improvements, including a three-state decomposition and estimating the relative contribution of each flow to both cyclical and relative unemployment rates, which reveals substantive differences between demographic groups.====Choi et al. (2015) focuses on explaining differences in unemployment and participation rates over the lifecycle. These authors abstract from the cyclicality of flows and instead use a Markov-chain simulation to construct lifecycle unemployment levels. Despite the differences in methodology, they also find that separations are the most important factor in explaining high youth unemployment rates.====Our results complement the literature on whether certain demographic groups are the first to be fired during recessions or the last to be hired during recoveries. Couch and Fairlie (2010) and Couch et al. (2016) test this hypothesis for non-white workers and Xu and Couch (2017) for young workers, finding evidence that supports the “first-fired” hypothesis but not the “last-hired” hypothesis. Our approach improves the methodology by analyzing cyclical transition dynamics, allowing us to show that while separations are an important part of the story, hiring dynamics play a larger role.====Finally, our paper also contributes to a literature on the racial employment gap. We find that the hiring margin can explain a larger fraction of the unemployment gap for non-white groups than for other disadvantaged groups. This is consistent with a large literature on racial discrimination, including Lang and Lehmann (2012), Gobillon et al. (2014), and Borowczyk-Martins et al. (2017).====The paper is organized as follows. The data and methodology are are explained in Section 2. Section 3 explains the decomposition approach for unemployment fluctuations and finds the estimated contributions for various transition flows. In Section 4 we use a similar approach for unemployment gaps and discuss the results. Section 5 explores mechanisms that may explain differences between groups.

Specifically, we identify the causal effects of disruptive peers by exploiting the random assignment of students to classrooms and using within school-grade variation in the proportion of children from families with alcoholic fathers in junior secondary schools. Our results show that children from families with alcoholic fathers significantly decrease the test scores of their peers. An examination of the underlying mechanisms suggests that disruptive peers increase misbehavior in the classroom. Moreover, a higher proportion of disruptive students in a class decreases peers’ time spent on homework assigned by teachers, implying that disruptive peers may impact teachers’ pedagogical practices and impede the learning of their peers.","Understanding the influence of school composition on individual outcomes is crucial for the evaluation of many education policies, such as school choice, subsidies, tracking, and policies to assimilate immigrant students. Recent evidence suggests that inclusion of disadvantaged children in classrooms has negative effects on other learners (e.g., Aizer, 2008; Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010; Cho, 2012; Diette and Oyelere, 2014; Figlio, 2007; Hill, 2014; Horoi and Ost, 2015; Kristoffersen et al., 2015; Lavy et al., 2012a, 2012b; Neidell and Waldfogel, 2010).==== Specifically,==== these studies focus on the effects of students with high potential for being disruptive, on the outcomes of their classmates, for example, students with attention deficit disorder (Aizer, 2008), immigrant students (Gould et al., 2009), student exposed to domestic violence (Carrell et al., 2018; Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010), repeaters (Huang and Zhu, 2020; Lavy et al., 2012a; Xu et al., 2020), students in the bottom 5% of the ability distribution (Lavy et al., 2012b), course repeaters (Hill, 2014), children with a psychiatric diagnosis or divorced or criminal parents (Kristoffersen et al., 2015), delinquent students (Ahn and Trogdon, 2017), and, even, boys with female sounding names (Figlio, 2007). This paper investigates the negative spillovers of troubled children exposed to alcoholic fathers (hereafter, “disruptive” peers) on students’ academic performance. We also identify some of the potential mechanisms and channels through which these effects operate.====The harmful use of alcohol is a worldwide problem resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) globally in 2016 (World Health Organization, 2018).==== In China, approximately 709,000 deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2016. Although per capita alcohol consumption in the world has remained stable recently, per capita alcohol consumption in China rose remarkably by approximately 76% over the last decade, from 4.1 liters in 2005 to 7.2 liters in 2016. The harmful use of alcohol has become an emerging problem in China. Moreover, alcohol is not only a causal factor in many diseases, but is also a precursor to injury and violence. Families with alcoholic fathers have been shown to experience various problems, such as lack of communication, increased conflict, and subpar parenting. Children of alcoholic fathers are at increased risk of various childhood stressors, such as physical and sexual abuse, neglect, witnessing domestic violence, or growing up with other forms of household dysfunction (Dube et al., 2001; Windle et al., 1995).==== As a result, children of alcoholic fathers have a higher risk of behavioral, social, and emotional problems at school.====Using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), we show that students from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers have substantially lower academic achievements than students with non-alcoholic fathers.==== Moreover, exposure to an alcoholic father in one's own family is associated with high levels of misbehavior, for example, being late for school and skipping classes. Furthermore, students exposed to alcoholic fathers feel that the learning environment is less friendly and the classroom atmosphere is less satisfying than do those not exposed to alcoholic fathers. In this study, students from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers are referred to as “disruptive students.” As suggested by the “bad apple” peer effects model, the presence of a single disruptive student can negatively affect the outcomes of all other students in the classroom.==== We then assess how the proportion of disruptive peers in the classroom affects the academic achievement of junior secondary school students.====Based on randomized student assignments, our results show that increased exposure to children linked to alcoholic fathers leads to a statistically significant reduction in average test scores, which is consistent with the “bad apple” model. Specifically, adding 1 more troubled child to a classroom of 40 students (2.5-percentage point increase) causes the average test score of the other students to fall by 0.016 standard deviations. The externalities from having more disruptive peers is mostly driven by the presence of a very high proportion of disruptive peers. We further show that girls, students from educated families, and high ability students, are most affected by exposure to disruptive peers in the classroom. Nevertheless, female head teachers tend to mitigate the negative externalities caused by disruptive students. An examination of the underlying mechanisms suggests that disruptive peers cause more disciplinary problems in the classroom, resulting in lower academic performance. Moreover, because students from troubled families learn more slowly, the teacher may need to adapt her pace to suit the troubled students, which slows down the learning of their peers. We find that when there are more disruptive peers in the class, students in the 9th grade or students in classes with male head teachers spend less time on the homework assigned by teachers.====It is difficult to identify the causal effect of troubled children on peers. First, it is difficult to determine the direction of causality: whether a disruptive child causes his or her classmates to misbehave or whether the misbehaving classmates cause the child to be disruptive. In addition, troubled children are likely to self-select into the same classroom as other disadvantaged children. Finally, the poor academic performance of disruptive students and their classmates may be due to common unobserved factors.====We overcome these problems by using the presence of alcoholic fathers as an exogenous source of variation in peer quality in a setting of random classroom assignment. First, this enables us to identify the group of troubled children in a more precise way than by using demographic measures, such as gender or race (Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010). An additional advantage of this measure is that we can identify students who are troubled for family reasons exogenous to their peers (i.e., the child's peers are not the cause of the alcoholic father in the household). Thus, applying the presence of alcoholic fathers overcomes the reflection problem.====In addition, this unique dataset allows us to exploit the random assignment of students to classrooms and to include school-grade fixed effects to control for the selection of students into schools. Thus, the identification assumption is that, given the sample of randomized classrooms, all other determinants of students’ academic performance are orthogonal to the within school-grade variation in peer alcoholic fathers. Empirical evidence in this study shows that the within school-grade variation in disruptive peers is uncorrelated with pre-determined student characteristics, including own alcoholic father, age, gender, ethnicity, number of siblings, ==== status, mother's and father's years of schooling, low-income household indicator, and baseline cognitive and non-cognitive measures. This evidence verifies the randomness of classroom assignment for our sample. Furthermore, there is no evidence that children exit the class after being exposed to a particularly high proportion of troubled peers. Finally, we show that the effects of disruptive peers on students’ academic achievement are robust to the inclusion of teacher controls and average peer characteristics. Thus, our identification overcomes the usual problems of selection and reflection, as well as the correlated effects problem in the estimation of peer effects.====Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. The first is that our unique dataset enables us to exploit the random assignment of students into classrooms to identify the causal effects of disruptive peers using a large, nationally representative sample of junior high schools. Most existing studies exploit the natural variation in cohort composition across time within a given school (Bifulco et al., 2011; Carrell et al., 2018; Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010; Lavy et al., 2012a; Lavy and Schlosser, 2011); thus, the peer group in these studies is defined as students in the same grade level (within the same school and year). Students in the same classroom are a much more relevant peer group for studying social spillovers than are the broader group of students in the same grade (Burke and Sass, 2013; Lazear, 2001).==== In addition, our study enables us to draw more general conclusions than do studies based on experimental designs which focus on one school or district.====Second, this study detects heterogeneous peer effects by the gender of the disruptive children and their peers. We show that troubled children primarily impact the academic achievement of girls, which implies that the academic performance of girls may be more sensitive to the misbehavior of disruptive peers. We further show that boys from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers primarily cause the negative effects on the academic achievement of girls. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the presence of female head teachers can mitigate the negative externalities of disruptive students on girls. These findings imply that to compensate for a high share of students exposed to alcoholic fathers in classes, schools could allocate female head teachers to these classes to mitigate the negative externalities imposed by disruptive peers on girls.====Our study also contributes to the literature by shedding light on potential mechanisms through which peer effects operate. As in Aizer (2008), Carrell and Hoekstra (2010), and Imberman et al. (2012), we show that the misbehavior of disruptive peers in the classroom is an important mechanism. In addition, teachers’ responses to changes in the student composition may be another important channel.====Finally, this study provides evidence of the existence of spillovers in the classroom caused by alcoholism, which have not yet been explored in the literature. Previous studies have demonstrated that parental ==== plays a crucial role in a child's social, emotional, and cognitive development (Conner et al., 2020). Our results suggest that alcoholic fathers impact human capital development not only through the effect on human capital accumulation of their own children, but also through externalities imposed on others. Our findings offer a compelling justification for policymakers to be concerned about the harmful use of alcohol, which is an important public health problem.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows.

The reform increased the age at which students are separated into vocational and general tracks from 11 to 16 as well as updated the curriculum to include more general content instead of vocational. Using longitudinal administrative register data and exploiting the gradual implementation of the reform, I found a negative effect on employment in early career and a positive effect later in the lifecycle. Results for labor earnings are more nuanced and sensitive to different model specifications, but a positive effect was found in the late career. After the reform, the treated were more likely to choose academic ==== which could mediate the effects on employment. The results were similar for men and women.","Post World War II, many European countries implemented comprehensive school reforms to increase the number of years of compulsory education, introduce national curricula, and/or abolish or delay tracking. Previous studies have found that comprehensive school reforms increase educational attainment and earnings, on average, as well as intergenerational mobility (Aakvik, Salvanes, Vaage, 2010, Meghir, Palme, 2005, Pekkarinen, Uusitalo, Kerr, 2009). Little is known about how these reforms affect labor market outcomes over the lifecycle.====The main contribution of this paper is to provide one of the first estimates—to the best of my knowledge—of the effects of a comprehensive school reform on lifecycle employment and earnings patterns by studying the Finnish comprehensive school reform of 1972–1977.==== The reform increased the age at which students are separated into general and vocational tracks from 11 to 16. The reform also updated the curriculum to include more general content instead of vocational, keeping the number of years of compulsory schooling constant. An attractive feature of the reform is that it was gradually implemented across municipalities. The implementation scheme gave rise to a natural experiment utilized in this paper to compare outcomes across birth cohorts and municipalities using a difference-in-differences approach. The implementation scheme, together with extensive administrative register data on the labor market and educational outcomes, means that the causal effects of the reform may be studied through a nearly 30-year period.====Although studies on the reform have been conducted earlier, its effects on labor market outcomes over the lifecycle remain unknown. Previous studies show that the reform did have an impact on several outcomes. First, the reform increased women’s probability of enrolling in academic secondary and tertiary education and decreased the gender wage gap (Pekkarinen, 2008). Second, the reform decreased the intergenerational income elasticity by 23% (Pekkarinen et al., 2009). It also had a slight positive impact on verbal test scores measured by the Finnish Army Basic Skills Test. Among students whose parents had less than a high school education, arithmetic and logical reasoning test scores along with verbal test scores saw an increase as a result of the reform (Pekkala Kerr et al., 2013).====The reform effectively reduced the weight of vocational education in the Finnish school system by increasing the age of tracking into vocational and academic tracks and reducing the amount of vocational education in the curriculum of compulsory schooling. Thus, the present paper’s hypothesis of the effects of the reform across the lifecycle is based on the literature on the labor market effects of vocational and general education. First, it has been argued that vocational education offers youths an easier transition from school to work and, thus, may be an effective policy in combating youth unemployment (Ryan, 2001, Wolter, Ryan, 2011, Zimmermann, Biavaschi, Eichhorst, Giulietti, Kendzia, Muravyev, Pieters, Rodríguez-Planas, Schmidl, et al., 2013). However, due to technological advancements and structural changes in labor markets, the skills provided by vocational education may become obsolete faster than those provided by general education. Due to this skill depreciation, vocational education may lead to relatively high unemployment rates in later career stages. Krueger and Kumar (2004) claim that the slower adaptation of technology caused by skill-specific education may even help explain the difference in the growth rates of Europe and the US.====The existing empirical literature on the labor market effects of vocational and general education mostly supports a trade-off between early and late labor market advantages. The most notable study in this literature is Hanushek et al. (2017). Using microdata from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), it was found that vocational education indeed leads to better school-to-work transition, but it also becomes a disadvantage in terms of employment as early as the age of 50. Further, they found that the magnitude of the effect depends on the intensity of the treatment i.e., the degree of vocationalization of the country’s education system. For example, in Germany, where vocational education is strongly based on apprenticeship programs, the trade-off between early and late labor market advantages is starker than in countries such as Finland, which have school-based vocational programs.====Hampf and Woessmann (2017) and Forster et al. (2016) identified similar effects as Hanushek et al. (2017) using the more recent and richer PIAAC survey. Cörvers et al. (2011) estimated age-earnings patterns consistent with a trade-off between early and late labor market advantages for Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In addition, there are also recent country-specific studies with similar results, such as Brunello and Rocco (2017) for Great Britain, Weber (2014) for Switzerland, and Golsteyn and Stenberg (2017) and Stenberg and Westerlund (2015) for Sweden. A contrasting result from Sweden is by Hall (2016), who found no significant effect on risk of unemployment from a pilot scheme of a reform from 1988 to 1993, which lengthened upper secondary vocational education by an additional year of general education. Silliman and Virtanen (2019) exploited a regression discontinuity design created by a centralized admission system in Finland to show that upper secondary vocational education increases annual income by 7 percent. They found no evidence of the effects diminishing with time. However, their data allows the individuals to be followed only until the age of 31, making it impossible to estimate the effects in late career stages.====The present paper also makes a secondary contribution to this literature by examining the causal effects of reducing the vocationalization of a school system over the lifecycle. Many previous papers comparing the lifecycle effects of vocational and general education either don’t establish causality or base it on rather strong assumptions. For example, as a result of using cross-sectional data, the identification of causal effects in Hanushek et al. (2017) was based on the assumption that the selection of the type of education does not vary over time. Another possible source of bias in their model was that the test scores from IALS used as control variables could have very well been affected by the person’s education before taking the test (treatment), resulting in a “bad control” situation (see Angrist and Pischke, 2009).====The results of this paper support the hypothesis of a trade-off between employment early and late in the lifecycle. The results show that the reform harmed employment in the early career but that this gap reduced with age and finally turned into a positive effect from the mid-30s onward. Results for labor earnings are more imprecise and sensitive to different model specifications but a positive effect was found from late 30s onward. Changes in educational outcomes are a likely mediator of the effects of the reform. An analysis of the reform’s effect on completed degrees at age 30 showed that the reform increases educational attainment and the probability of choosing the academic track instead of the vocational track. Further, the results related to the labor market and educational outcomes are similar for men and women.",Comprehensive school reform and labor market outcomes over the lifecycle: Evidence from Finland,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301561,24 November 2020,2020,Research Article,220.0

Using a novel administrative dataset on the employment and unemployment history of 1/25==== of French workers and the timing-of-events approach, we find a robust stepping-stone effect and no evidence of a lock-in effect. Starting atypical work during unemployment raises the likelihood of finding regular work by 87% in the following months, and has no effect on wage growth. Interestingly, this effect is stronger for workers with weaker ties with the labor market, such as those unemployed for long periods, older individuals or those who worked fewer hours in the year prior to the start of the spell.","With the parallel rise in part-time jobs, temporary contracts, and agency work, there is considerable interest in understanding how such atypical work arrangements affect the careers of workers seeking regular, full-time work. After ample research, the question remains open, partly because of varying methodologies, contexts and data quality. This paper innovates by estimating the causal impact of atypical work on the transition to regular, full-time work using a novel French administrative dataset describing in detail the timing of workers’ employment and unemployment history. We are able to restrict our analysis to individuals who explicitly declare seeking a permanent position, to focus on specific subgroups and to disentangle between lock-in effects, stepping-stone effects and wage growth effects. We define atypical work as a less desirable and hopefully temporary work situation such as part-time or temporary work with fewer monthly hours than full-time work. We use the exact timing and duration of labor contracts to identify when an individual returns to full-time, durable work.====For job seekers lacking the right skill set or experience, atypical work may help develop expertise, meet potential new employers, and eventually succeed in having a temporary position converted into a permanent contract. Agency work can also play a similar role (see Neugart and Storrie (2006) and Houseman et al. (2003)), as well as subsidized jobs (see Gerfin et al. (2005)). This is often referred to as the “stepping stone” effect of atypical work. However, atypical work may reduce the time available or the incentive to search for a more desirable job, the so-called “lock-in” effect. In many countries, the possibility of combining atypical work with partial unemployment benefits also raises the same moral hazard concerns as regular unemployment benefits do (see McCall (1996) and Ek and Holmlund (2011), for instance). Over time, these effects could trap workers in a string of atypical jobs and repeated unemployment spells and worsen labor market dualism.====All of these channels can exist simultaneously, but it is unlikely that they would impact all workers uniformly. Workers with lower job prospects are probably the ones most likely to benefit from stepping stones while for more skilled or experienced workers, atypical work could provide little benefits, or even prove detrimental. Little attention has been paid to this potential heterogeneity in previous works, a neglect which could lead to poorly targeted labor policies.====A final source of ambiguity is the variety of reservation wages which directly affects the length of unemployment spells. To shed light on the potential trade-off between speed and wage gain and capture the total utility gain from doing atypical work, we jointly model the impact of atypical work on the log hourly wage gain from one regular job to the next.====Our empirical approach is based on the well-known timing-of-events (TOE) approach (Abbring and Van Den Berg, 2003) which captures the causal impact of atypical work by exploiting the randomness in the arrival of job offers. We were able to obtain privileged access to an administrative dataset of 1/25==== of the French population covering a 7-year period. This data contains detailed information on the duration and motives for which workers registered at ====, the French employment agency, administrative records used to compute unemployment benefits, and detailed information on all their employers, including their working hours, annual earnings, and firm-specific identifiers. This allowed us to define unemployment spells with great precision and identify when workers returned to stable full-time work without suffering from the censoring bias often encountered in the empirical literature.====We find a surprisingly strong stepping stone effect, and no evidence of lock-in effects. Having done atypical work previously in an unemployment spell raises the monthly probability of finding regular work by 87% on average. We find larger effects for long-term unemployed workers, older workers, and those who work fewer hours in the year prior to the start of the spell.

Developing countries are currently making huge investments in this general-purpose technology, with a view to achieving structural change. What can history teach us about its impact on the structure of employment? We use U.S. Census data and an identification strategy based on hydroelectric potential to identify the effects of the geographic expansion of higher-voltage electricity lines. We find that, over the period 1910–1940, electrification increased the share of operatives in the average county by 3.5 percentage points and decreased the share of farmers by 2.9 percentage points. These effects are primarily driven by ====, and they can account for more than half of the aggregate increase in operatives, and more than one quarter of the total decrease in farmers. These results suggest that electrification was a key contributor to U.S. structural transformation.","For the first time in U.S. history, the federal Census in 1920 reported more than 50% of residents living in urban areas, marking a turning point in a long movement off farms and towards cities, with the accompanying transition to urban occupations and industries. Fig. 1 illustrates a massive labor reallocation over the period 1910–1940, from agricultural occupations toward ones more concentrated in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and wholesale trade. This structural transformation was achieved relatively late in the U.S., due to its status as a young, land-rich nation. The backdrop was an equally dramatic transformation of infrastructure, involving the move from steam to electric power in cities and from horse to electric power on farms. While this kind of structural transformation is one of the most salient features of economic development (Herrendorf et al., 2014)—identified as one of Kuznets’ stylized facts of development (Kuznets, 1966)—there is still considerable debate about its underlying causes. This paper focuses on the specific role played by electrification in this transition from an agriculture intensive to a manufacturing intensive economy.==== As electricity is a general-purpose technology that drove the second industrial revolution in the developed world (Gordon, 2017) and still plays a crucial role for economic development today (Fried and Lagakos, 2017), this question is not only of interest to economic historians but is also of first order importance for development economists and policymakers. For example, many developing countries are currently witnessing unprecedented investment in electrification as a vehicle for development, in the hope that it will stimulate structural transformation, pushing more workers into modern, higher valued-added sectors. In fact, the World Bank argues that “infrastructure has a central role in the development agenda and is a major contributor to growth” (World Bank, 2005) and it has helped 45 million people to gain access to electricity from 2014 to 2018 and spent over $5 billion on energy programs.==== Ethiopia is a leading example of a developing nation recently investing heavily in electricity, as its production has increased seven-fold in the 16 years since 2000 (Fried and Lagakos, 2017, 1). Despite these massive investments in electrification, there is still considerable debate on what exactly these economies should expect in response.====We contribute to this debate by exploring the causal effect of electrification on U.S. structural change from 1910 to 1940. Looking at this historical episode allows us to analyze the long run impacts of electrification over three decades, which is generally not possible in the modern development literature but is important given the lengthy time general-purpose technologies need to unfold their full potential through complementary innovations.====The primary challenge in estimating the impact of electrification is that adoption was endogenous to existing levels of development, skill and industrial composition. We address this concern by appealing to two related observations: first, while coal-powered electricity was widely available in urban areas by 1910, hydroelectric power was limited. The primary benefit of hydroelectric power generation is its low variable cost, while the main downsides are sizable fixed costs (e.g., building a dam in a remote location) and the remoteness of the most suitable sites for power generation. We argue that the latter was the main reason for the dominance of coal before 1920.====Second, the high-voltage power grid was nonexistent in 1910, and greatly expanded after 1920 (see Figs. 2 and 4), due to technological innovations in power transmission.==== Since coal could be transported to any given location, this new technology was not particularly useful for coal generated power. In stark contrast, this technology allowed hydroelectric power to be transported to end users from remote locations, making massive construction projects such as the Hoover Dam viable. The low variable cost of hydroelectric power combined with high-voltage transmission lines imply that the expansion of the grid led to a significant reduction in the price of electricity in serviced locations and increased adoption in such areas.====Our strategy to estimate the causal impact of electrification exploits the geographic variation in this price shock. While the eventual path of the distribution lines that connected individual places to the grid was almost certainly driven primarily by electricity demand, we argue that places close to highly suitable locations for hydroelectric power generation were effectively exogenously “treated” with high-voltage power lines. To implement this idea, we use geographic variation in “hydroelectric potential”—a measure governed by fixed, exogenous topographic characteristics of a place, inversely related to the cost of building and operating a hydroelectric power station in any given location—to instrument for the observed geographic expansion of the high-voltage power grid. We find that this variation provides a strong and relevant instrument.====Other studies have used similar instruments. For example, Dinkelman (2011) used land gradient—a fixed topographic feature that is inversely related to the cost of building transmission lines—as an instrument for the South African electric grid to analyze the effect of grid expansion to more remote areas. Lipscomb et al. (2013) simulate a hypothetical electricity grid expansion for the period 1960–2000 in Brazil, to capture how the grid would have evolved had infrastructure investments been based solely on geography-based cost considerations. They use this as an instrument for the actual grid and analyze the impact on growth through various channels including agricultural productivity. Lewis and Severnini (2020) use the distance to new power plants for counties in the U.S., from 1930 to 1960, to identify exogenous variation in electricity cost, which works because rural customers were too small a fraction of the overall customer base to determine plant location. In our study, more rural counties are most affected by our instrument, and farm service made up only 2.6% of nationwide electricity customers in 1932, implying that these counties are very unlikely to have driven transmission line or power plant placement (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015, 1163).====Using this empirical strategy, we investigate the impact of 1910–1940 electrification on the occupational and industrial structure of male county employment in 1940, given initial 1910 conditions.==== We find that 100 extra kilometers of high-voltage power lines significantly decreased the share of farmers among American men, and significantly increased the share of operatives, a mid-level blue-collar job, usually associated with manufacturing work. In parallel, electrification significantly decreased the share of farming in male employment and increased the share of manufacturing. Given that most of the structural change occurred within regions rather than through migration across regions (Eckert and Peters, 2018), we can use our county-level estimates to project the aggregate effect of electrification on the occupational and industrial structure.==== The size of our estimates suggests that electrification can account for approximately 54% of the aggregate increase in the share of operatives, and 26% of the aggregate decline in the share of farmers between 1910 and 1940, while at the same time accounting for 24% of the aggregate decline in agriculture and 36% of the aggregate increase in manufacturing. Fig. 1 illustrates these results for estimates significant at least at the 10% confidence level, suggesting that electrification was a key driver of structural transformation in the U.S.====Our analysis makes three key contributions to the literature. First, we construct a credible instrument for the expansion of the high-voltage power grid, based on hydroelectric potential. Second, we study the impact of electrification on the entire continental U.S., examining its effects on the structure of employment. To do so, we digitized historical maps from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to document the expansion of the high-voltage electricity grid, providing a more accurate picture of electrification than previously available. Earlier studies analyze either the manufacturing sector, using the Census of Manufacturers (Gray, 2013), or the agricultural sector (Census of Agriculture) in isolation (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015), and some focus on programs that were only applicable in a few states (Kline and Moretti, 2013). Ours is the first to use detailed exogenous variation in electricity adoption to study potential labor reallocation ====, rather than ==== sectors. Furthermore, because we use full count Census data, we are able to go beyond agriculture and manufacturing and analyze the impact of electrification on the full occupational and industrial structure. We thus complement the work by Katz and Margo (2014), which identified, in a descriptive manner, the degree of skill bias in the aggregate economy over the longer run from the mid-nineteenth century to 2010.====Third, the extant literature on structural transformation offers a variety of theoretical explanations for its ultimate causes. Gollin et al. (2013) provide a summary, from theories that focus on the increased productivity of manufacturing and services, which creates a “pull” force for labor to exit agriculture, and the “push” theories which investigate the price and income effects influencing the move away from the primary sector.==== One class of models draws on dominant income effects (through non-homothetic preferences) while another class of models draws on a production structure in which general-purpose technology shocks—through a reduction in the relative price—have differential effects in different sectors (Herrendorf et al., 2014). Our analysis provides evidence that the invention of high-voltage electrical power transmission—a general-purpose technology—directly caused structural transformation of rural America during the period 1910–1940, consistent with the theory of technology-driven structural transformation.====In Section 2, we discuss the role electricity could play in the structure of employment.

I exploit the introduction of master's degrees offered in English by a university while students are already enrolled in a bachelor's program as an instrument for studying in English. I find that English-taught degrees increase an individual's probability of working abroad by 11.3 percentage points. The results are driven by students outside of the top-10 universities in Italy and students from universities in less-developed regions of the country.","European Union priorities for 2020 include fostering education and labor mobility to stimulate youth employment at home and abroad (European Commission, 2011). Yet, while the link between studying abroad and international labor mobility is widely recognized (González, Mesanza, Mariel, 2011, Oosterbeek, Webbink, 2011, Parey, Waldinger, 2011), the effect of studying in English in a non-English speaking country on graduates' migration decisions is still unexplored. Understanding the labor market outcomes of graduates in English-taught programs is central to analyzing the increasing investments that European universities have made in these degrees over the last decade. Moreover, it is important to determine whether these programs contribute to the European labor mobility goal.====From a theoretical perspective, an increase in the supply of English-taught programs might have two opposite effects. On the one hand, it might enhance international work opportunities. On the other hand, a degree taught in English may make graduates more competitive in the national labor market, resulting in better labor outcomes that may reduce the comparative benefits of international migration. While both outcomes are plausible, many potential confounding factors make it difficult to study the effect of English-taught programs on labor mobility. Ideally, one would observe the labor market outcomes of students who were randomly assigned to university programs held in English compared to those assigned to programs taught in their native language. In the absence of such a randomized experiment, establishing a causal link between attaining a degree in English and working abroad after graduation is challenging. Students who decide to attend a program taught in English are in many ways different from students who choose a degree in their mother tongue. Specifically, the intention to move abroad may induce students to study in English.====I provide causal evidence of the effect of studying in English on labor mobility through a novel instrument for enrollment in master's programs taught in English. Specifically, I exploit the introduction of a master's degree taught in English in a given university at the same time as a student is pursuing a bachelor's degree at the same university.==== The instrument takes a value of one for students exposed to the introduction of an MA in English in their university and discipline while they are enrolled in their BA. This avoids that students self-select into programs offering MA in English according to their future migration intentions. Critically, students are unlikely to predict when programs taught in English will be introduced (Card, 1993, Card, 2001, Parey, Waldinger, 2011).====Italy is an ideal country to investigate this question, as different Italian universities have been introducing the possibility to study in English since 2008. Moreover, different departments within the same universities began offering degrees in English in different academic years during this time period.==== I use a survey of Italian graduates provided by the AlmaLaurea consortium of Italian universities. I merge these data with a complete list of MA programs taught in English launched each year since 2008 in each Italian university and for every discipline, provided by the Italian National Ministry of Education (MIUR). The resulting sample includes more than 240,000 MA graduates from 2010 to 2015.====I find that studying in English has a strong causal effect on graduates' labor market mobility. In particular, I find that attaining an MA degree taught in English increases an individual's probability of working abroad one year after graduation by 11.3 percentage points, or almost five times the sample average.====I present several robustness checks for this result. First, I estimate the model on groups of cohorts of graduates to test the power of the instrument over different time periods. Second, I remove fields of study one at a time to check whether fields for which there is no MA taught in English inflate standard errors. Third, I also run my regressions by removing regions of study one at a time to assess migration heterogeneity to border proximity. Finally, to avoid endogeneity issues, the instrument does not consider the fact that students may switch universities and/or fields of study from the BA to the MA. For this reason, I remove different groups of “switchers” from the sample to test the coefficient response. My results are not restricted to particular fields of study, regions, or changes in universities and fields of study from the BA to the MA, and they are highly robust for all these sensitivity analyses.====Furthermore, I investigate whether the results are somehow driven by graduates belonging to specific groups of disciplines, universities, or geographical areas. For this reason, I initially divide the sample into graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and those not in STEM fields. Second, I use the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking (QS-Ranking),==== and I split the sample into graduates of top-10 universities and those who did not graduate from these universities. Third, I divide the sample into graduates from northern, central, and southern Italy. I find a positive and statistically significant result exclusively for graduates in STEM fields,==== for students who did not graduate from a top-10 university, and for students who did graduate in the south.====Finally, to provide evidence that the results are externally valid, I implement the test on the conditional independence assumption proposed by Black et al. (2017) that allows for measuring selection bias. Essentially, the test involves estimating a reduced form model on the sample of treated, comparing the so-called ==== and ====, and on the sample of the untreated to compare ==== and ====. I find no evidence of a strong selection bias. However, the test provides only noisy evidence of no selection due to the small size of the treatment sample and this also justifies the use of an instrumental variable approach. For this reason, it seems more prudent to generalize the local average treatment effect on ==== to only the subpopulation of ====.",The effect of a university degree in english on international labor mobility,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301470,2 November 2020,2020,Research Article,223.0

Using panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a dynamic multinomial logit model of transitions between labour market states is estimated. The empirical strategy closely follows that used in a previous study employing household data from Germany by Lechmann and Wunder (2017). Estimates of true cross-state dependence between solo self-employment and employership are obtained that are relatively small. Further, the results imply that the probability of a male worker being an employer just two years after transitioning out of solo self-employment is only about 4% (and among women, it is just 2%). The extent of both true cross-state dependence and true state dependence in employership is, however, much greater among individuals who have demonstrated a preference for self-employment in the past. This implies that pro-entrepreneurial policies that target more ‘entrepreneurial’ individuals will have more pronounced and long-term effects in stimulating job creation.","Governments in many Western countries devote taxpayer funded resources to supporting self-employed entrepreneurs on the grounds that new start-up businesses are critical for the creation of new jobs. Yet most self-employed workers do not hire anyone. Data available from the International Labour Organization (ILO) website (ilostat.ilo.org/data), for example, indicate that, among developed nations, the percentage of self-employed workers who employ others ranged, in 2018, from just 14% in the UK to 44% in Germany, with the multi-country average being around 31% (and with Australia being above average, at around 35%).==== Policies that incentivize transitions out of unemployment into self-employment, while obviously reducing unemployment in the short run, may thus have little additional job creation impacts. Indeed, and as noted by Congregado, Golpe and Carmona (2010), such measures, by attracting persons who are not well suited to self-employment, may have employment effects that are only temporary.====For entrepreneurship policies to be successful, in the sense of creating firms that generate new jobs, requires targeting those entrepreneurs who are most likely to transition from working alone (i.e., the solo self-employed, often also referred to as own-account workers) to employing others (i.e., employers). Somewhat surprisingly, however, especially given the many studies seeking to unpack the mechanisms that encourage individuals to enter self-employment (for reviews see Parker, 2009; Simoes et al., 2016; van Praag and Versloot, 2007), there has been relatively little research on the factors influencing transitions out of solo self-employment into employer status.====Notable exceptions here are a series of studies involving analysis of data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) by Millán and colleagues (Congregado, Millán and Román, 2010; Millán et al., 2013, 2014, 2015) – though only one (Millán et al., 2014) provides a direct test of whether solo self-employment has any effect on the probability of becoming an employer in the future – and analyses of household panel data from both the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) (Lechmann and Wunder, 2017) and the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Henley, 2019).====Millán et al. (2014) estimate discrete-time models of the hazard of exit out of both solo self-employment and employership within a competing risks framework. Prior experience is represented by a simple dummy variable indicating whether the respondent reported ever previously working as an own-account worker (i.e., solo self-employed worker), an employer or a paid employee. To the authors’ surprise, prior experience as a solo self-employed worker is not found to influence the probability of transitioning from solo self-employment to employership. At the same time, the estimated probability of switching from solo self-employed to employer is found to be markedly higher than the probability of exiting to other states, which the authors take as a “sign of success” and so conclude that the results are consistent with the notion that there is persistence in entrepreneurship and hence provide support for public investments in new start-ups. We suggest such a conclusion is not warranted. First, it is inconsistent with their finding that previous experience in self-employment is irrelevant, and second, their estimation method does not allow the “true” effect of solo self-employment on employership in the future (true state dependence) to be isolated from the effects of other factors that influence both solo self-employment in the past and employership in the future (spurious state dependence).====Henley (2019) too estimates a discrete-time model of the hazard of exiting solo self-employment into employership, but with the sample restricted to those observed in self-employment.==== Furthermore, he includes a person-specific random error component as a way of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, prior self-employment experience is captured with a cumulative measure of years of experience rather than a dummy. In contrast to Millán et al. (2014), a positive relationship between transition into employer status and elapsed duration in self-employment is found, providing arguably stronger evidence for the hypothesis that prior experiences of self-employment have a causal effect on the probability of employing workers in the future. Nevertheless, the methods applied are still problematic. Like Millán et al (2014), the data are censored for cases where the self-employed are never observed becoming employers over the (6-year) data period, and the use of random effects imposes the unlikely assumption that the explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the unobserved error component.====Far more convincing is the estimation strategy employed by Lechmann and Wunder (2017). They employ a very broad sample, which is not just restricted to persons observed entering self-employment, and estimate a dynamic multinomial logit model that controls for both the previously observed employment state and initial conditions as well as unobserved heterogeneity, but this time using correlated random effects. They find that the “genuine effect” of experiencing solo self-employment (relative to wage employment or non-employment) on future employership is both small (about a 5 percentage point increase for men and a little over just 2 percentage points for women) and not long-lasting. As such, these results are discouraging for proponents of subsidies and policy measures designed to encourage individuals to enter self-employment. Of course, this is only one study utilising data from one country, and thus replication both in Germany and in other institutional settings is required before it can be confidently concluded that such measures will typically have little lasting effect on employment.====Providing such a replication is the aim of this study. More specifically, we utilise a similar household panel survey data set to that used by both Lechmann and Wunder (2017) and Henley (2019), but from Australia (a country where self-employment rates have tended to be higher than the average across other industrial nations, and certainly much higher than in Germany), and apply the same estimation strategy used by Lechmann and Wunder. We obtain estimates of true cross-state dependence that are strikingly similar in size to those found in the German study.",Does solo self-employment serve as a ‘stepping stone’ to employership?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301469,1 November 2020,2020,Research Article,224.0

Our paper evaluates three important channels for hiring —namely vacancy posting, the selectivity of hiring (labor selection), and the number of search channels— through the lens of an undirected search model. Vacancy posting and labor selection show a U-shape over the employment growth distribution. The number of search channels is also upward sloping for growing establishments, but relatively flat for shrinking establishments. We argue that growing establishments react to positive establishment-specific productivity shocks by using all three channels more actively. Furthermore, we connect the fact that shrinking establishments post more vacancies and are less selective than those with a constant workforce to churn triggered by employment-to-employment transitions. In line with our theoretical framework, all three hiring margins are procyclical over the business cycle.","In the canonical search and matching model (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994), firms exclusively rely on the number of posted vacancies to adjust the number of hires. Through the aggregate matching function, the search and matching model contains a tight link between the number of posted vacancies and the number of hires. Davis et al. (2013, p. 590) argue that standard theory misses important other channels: In addition to the vacancy margin, firms may also vary their recruiting intensity, i.e. “(...) employers rely on a mix of recruiting and hiring practices that differ in propensity to involve a measured vacancy and in vacancy duration.” In a similar vein, based on a structural model, Gavazza et al. (2018) show that firms’ recruiting intensity is strongly procyclical over the business cycle. Both articles document that recruiting intensity is very important for explaining cross-sectional and time-series patterns in the United States (e.g., the collapse of hiring during the Great Recession).====While Davis et al. (2013) and Gavazza et al. (2018) quantify the role of recruiting intensity for job-filling rates from the residual of a generalized matching function, there is no direct evidence for the behavior of different hiring margins in the United States. The behavior of vacancy yields over the employment distribution and over time are known.==== By contrast, the exact drivers for these vacancy yields remain a black box. What are the instruments —other than vacancies— that firms use? How strongly do firms vary these instruments in the cross section (e.g., along the employment growth distribution) and over time (i.e., along the business cycle)? Answers to these questions are important for economic modelers, both to get the micro-foundations and the transmission mechanisms right. These are crucial prerequisites for meaningful counterfactual policy exercises and welfare statements.====Our paper starts by presenting a simple multi-worker firm optimization problem where firms can use three hiring margins. Although we do not solve for the full heterogeneous agent equilibrium, firms’ optimality conditions are a useful tool for measuring different recruiting channels in the data and for hypothesizing how firms should respond to different shocks. In our model, firms post vacancies in order to attract applicants and they choose an effort level at which they want to advertise these vacancies. Following Gavazza et al. (2018), we assume that both vacancies and effort are subject to a convex cost function. In addition, firms choose the fraction of applicants they want to hire. Following Chugh and Merkl (2016), applicants draw from an idiosyncratic training cost distribution.==== Firms choose an endogenous training cost cutoff and thereby endogenously determine their selectivity. We derive three hypotheses from our model. First, firms that are hit by a positive firm-specific productivity shock post more vacancies, increase their search effort, and are less selective. Second, as we assume a decreasing returns to labor production function, firms that (unexpectedly) lose a fraction of workers face an increase of their marginal product and thereby increase their hiring activity in all three dimensions. Third, we expect all three hiring margins to be procyclical over the business cycle. In a boom, firms’ profits and their incentive to hire more workers increase. Thereby, they use all three margins more intensively. These three hypotheses guide our data analysis.====Given the lack of suitable survey data for the United States,==== our paper uses the German IAB-Stellenerhebung (IAB Job Vacancy Survey, JVS henceforth) to look into the black box of recruiting intensity and hiring practices. The JVS is a representative annual cross-sectional survey of up to 14,000 establishments==== (Moczall et al., 2015). These establishments are asked about the number of hires, separations, and vacancies in a particular year. In addition, they provide detailed information on their most recent hire (such as the used search channels or the number of suitable applicants). From the JVS, we construct empirical indicators for establishments’ recruiting intensity and for their selectivity. For recruiting intensity, we use a normalized measure for the number of search channels that establishments used for their most recent hire. For selectivity, we utilize information on the number of suitable applicants for an establishment’s most recent hire. An establishment that hires a large fraction of suitable applicants is considered to be less selective than an establishment that hires a small fraction of suitable applicants. As in Hochmuth et al. (2019), we thus use the inverse of the number of suitable applicants for the most recent hire.====Furthermore, we are the first to complement the data from the JVS with administrative information from the Administrative Wage and Labor Market Flow Panel (AWFP) which contains job flows, worker flows, and wage information for the universe of establishments in Germany (Stüber and Seth, 2018). Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2020) recently linked the JVS with the Integrated Employment Biographies of the IAB at the establishment level. Using the variation across local labor markets, they analyze vacancy yields, recruiting intensity, and matching efficiency. Among other things, they show that the recruiting intensity matters for matching efficiency. Later, we argue that their paper is complementary to ours in various dimensions.====Our paper documents the following three important facts: First, we show that the number of search channels is upward sloping in the positive part of the employment growth distribution. By contrast, it is relatively flat in the negative part of the employment growth distribution. These cross-sectional facts for search channels can be explained by establishment-specific productivity shocks. Larger positive productivity shock stimulate establishments’ employment growth and thereby give an incentive to establishments to increase their recruiting intensity.====Second, both the vacancy rate and the selection rate show a U-shape over the employment growth distribution. Through the lens of our model, the upward sloping path in the positive part of the employment growth distribution can again be explained by positive firm-specific productivity shocks. But why do (faster) shrinking firms post more vacancies and are less selective than firms with a constant workforce? Bachmann et al. (2020) show that faster shrinking establishments are subject to more worker churn than establishments with a constant workforce. Intuitively, establishments in the negative part of the employment growth distribution lose more workers than expected and thereby have to hire new workers to adjust to their desired size. In different words, they lose workers and hire workers within the same period (within a given skill group and more so, the more they shrink). Therefore, our paper establishes a link between worker churn and hiring margins. We show that faster shrinking establishments post on average more vacancies and select a larger fraction of workers than establishments with a constant workforce in order to accomplish their necessary replacement hirings.==== As Bachmann et al. (2020) show a strong comovement between churn and employment-to-employment transitions, we link the three hiring margins to employment-to-employment transitions, showing a positive connection. From a theoretical perspective this can be rationalized by firms with a decreasing returns to labor production function that increase their marginal product when they lose workers (on an involuntary basis).====Third, in line with our theoretical predictions, the vacancy rate, the selection rate, and the number of search channels all move procyclically over the business cycle. In a slack labor market establishments post fewer vacancies, use fewer search channels, and are less selective than in a tight labor market. The development of the used number of search channels over time is in line with procyclical recruiting intensity, as argued by Davis et al. (2013) and Gavazza et al. (2018).",Recruiting intensity and hiring practices: Cross-sectional and time-series evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301433,31 October 2020,2020,Research Article,225.0

The first wave focused on children to age 14 and the second wave focused on high school. Using the full count 1940 census and a new coding of state laws, this paper provides new estimates of the effects of the first wave of laws. The analysis focuses on cohorts of prime working age between 1910 and 1940. IV estimates of returns to schooling range from 0.067 to 0.077. Quantile IV estimates show the returns were largest for the lowest quantiles, and were generally monotonically decreasing for higher quantiles.","The nineteenth and twentieth century in the U.S. saw two nationwide waves of state-level schooling requirements. The first wave generally focused on the educational attainment of children up to age 14, and the second wave focused on high school attendance. The second wave has been the focus of a substantial literature, which has both examined the causal effects of the laws on years of schooling and the returns to these additional years (Lleras-Muney, 2002; Goldin and Katz, 2011; Stephens and Yang, 2014). The first wave has received considerably less attention, even though it laid the foundation for the second wave. Further, individuals subject to first wave laws were prime age workers during 1910-1940, a period of rapid transition in the American economy.====Did the implementation and expansion of this first wave of schooling laws increase educational attainment? If so, what were the returns associated with the additional years of schooling? These questions matter not only for historical analysis, but for other developing nations seeking to draw on the historical experience of the United States.==== Drawing on the full count 1940 census and a new detailed coding of state compulsory attendance, continuation school, and child labor laws, this paper provides new estimates of the effects of laws on the number of years of schooling and the returns to schooling. As with prior work that exploits variation in state schooling requirements based on state and year of birth (e.g, Angrist and Krueger, 1991; Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000; Lleras-Muney, 2002; Oreopoulos, 2006; Stephens and Yang, 2014), the analysis is limited to native-born individuals. Both for comparability with much of the prior literature and in recognition of the fact that many institutional factors (e.g., Jim Crow laws, lagging school quality for blacks, Rosenwald schools, and differing employment opportunities across gender and racial lines for teenagers, such as cultural norms against work outside of the home for women) must be carefully addressed to accurately assess the impact of schooling and child labor laws on the economic outcomes of blacks and women, the sample is further restricted to white males.==== Thus, the analysis focuses on native-born white men from the 1885-1912 birth cohorts who are age 27 to 54 when the 1940 Census was enumerated.====The key source of identifying variation in this paper is the number of years of schooling a child is required to attend. This schooling requirement is calculated for an individual from a given state born in a specific year based on the prevailing compulsory schooling, child labor, and continuation schooling laws throughout their schooling years. The information on schooling laws builds on work by previous authors (Lleras-Muney, 2002 and Goldin and Katz, 2011) by extending the coding of laws back to earlier time periods (pre-1910). For the post-1910 period, the coding of the laws builds on the work of Stephens and Yang (2014) by revisiting original session laws and reconciling differences between these sources and the coding of the schooling and child labor laws found in prior studies.====The 2SLS estimates of the returns to schooling found here range from 0.067 to 0.077. Excluding Southern born men for whom the trend in schooling laws and educational attainment was growing most rapidly (Stephens and Yang, 2014), the IV estimate is only slightly smaller, at 0.064. Unlike the prior literature, this paper also presents quantile IV estimates to examine the impact of additional schooling across the earnings distribution. The results show that the returns to schooling are largest for the lower quantiles with estimates of 0.14 and 0.11 at the 25==== and 50==== quantiles, respectively. However, the estimated returns generally decrease monotonically for higher quantiles, e.g., falling to -0.00 for the 75==== quantile.====The paper contributes to multiple literatures. The first is the literature on the returns to schooling. A number of papers including Angrist and Krueger (1991); Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011); Stephens and Yang (2014) have primarily used second wave schooling laws to estimate returns to schooling. For example, Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011) estimate effects for the 1899-1982 cohorts and Stephens and Yang (2014) estimate effects for the 1905-1954 cohorts. This paper provides new estimates for the 1885-1912 cohorts which were primarily affected by the first wave of schooling laws.====The second is the literature on the effects of schooling laws on years of schooling. This paper is closest to Lleras-Muney (2002); Goldin and Katz (2011), and Lleras-Muney and Shertzer (2015) although it is distinct from these papers in important ways: i) a focus on earlier birth cohorts, ii) use of the full count 1940 census instead of the much smaller IPUMS samples; iii) use of a new detailed coding of state compulsory attendance, continuation school, and child labor laws which builds on and extends prior datasets; and iv) use of a more flexible specification for estimating the effects of the laws. Even with these differences, this paper finds small but significant effects of schooling laws on years of schooling as have been found in the prior literature.====The paper is set out as follows. The next section provides background on the development of compulsory attendance, continuation schooling, and child labor laws in the United States. The following two sections discuss the data and the empirical methodology, respectively.

This study examines a unique case concerning the new college graduate labor market in Japan, where a guideline revision successfully delayed the timing of job searches and forced market participants to search under a shorter horizon. Based on differential exposures to the guideline revision across regions, I find that the revision significantly increased the employment rate at graduation. No positive effect was observed on students’ ====. Additional analyses offers one plausible interpretation, that the positive employment effect was driven by thick market externality.","Transitioning smoothly from school to work is an important factor for workers succeeding in their careers. It is especially true in competitive occupations, in which concerns over getting a nice head start on a career sometimes drive students desperate to secure their post-graduation positions quite in advance to the actual start date, even more than a year prior to completing their school programs.==== For example, in the market for US federal judicial law clerks, law school students sometimes receive offers as early as the beginning of the students’ second year (Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, et al., 2007, Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, 2001). In the US gastroenterologist fellowship market, internal medical residents obtained offers nearly one year prior to graduation before a new centralized match system was introduced in 2006 (Niederle and Roth, 2009). A similar phenomenon has been observed in labor markets for other specialty residencies, MBA and law school graduates in the U.S., new college graduates in Japan (Niederle, Roth, 2009, Roth, Xing, 1994), and more recently, internships for investment bankers, which can eventually give way to full-time positions after graduation (Hoffman, 2018). Such an early matching of potential employers and workers raises the question whether can it bring any benefits to market participants.====Indeed, unorganized hiring processes have invited debate over whether to regulate job search timing by setting up uniform dates to start interviewing and make offers.==== According to the proponents of such a regulation, job search timing matters. Questionnaire surveys on federal appellate judges reveal their concerns that information about students’ ability is not fully available at the early stages of their school programs (Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, et al., 2007, Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, 2001). Others are concerned that early and dispersed matching would deprive students of time devoted to classes, thereby discouraging them from investing in their own human capital (in an official request by three Japanese ministers, October 8, 2010). Despite the repeated attempts to directly regulate timing, this strategy is rarely successful, often leading market participants to deviate from the rule.==== Most importantly, little is known about whether the early, lengthy job search results in otherwise better outcomes for the students.====This paper provides the first evidence on the consequences of regulating job search timing by exploiting the unique case of the new college graduate job market in Japan, where a guideline revision successfully delayed search timing and forced market participants to search under a shorter horizon. Similar to some entry-level labor markets in the U.S., the first job substantially influences new graduates’ careers in Japan. Failure to obtain full-time regular positions at graduation has a persistent detrimental effect on students’ employment statuses and earnings (Genda, Kondo, Ohta, 2010, Kondo, 2007), making students desperate to secure offers long before starting jobs.==== By 2009, the job search timing advanced to the middle of the junior year, nearly 18 months prior to graduation. In 2010, the biggest business association announced it would revise the guideline and establish a job search start date for the first time since its introduction. Similar to previous attempts, such as those by the Judicial Conference in the market for US federal court clerks, the revision was not legally binding and market participants could always deviate from the rule. Unlike previous cases, however, the revision successfully delayed the overall timing due to the closure of a popular online platform until the first date specified in the revision. Because college students start communicating with firms’ personnel via these online platforms by registering for first-step seminars and because these online platforms were so dominant, the market was diluted substantially in that much fewer firms and students were available in the market prior to the first date.====Based on administrative survey data covering nearly the entire college population in Japan, I first find that the revision indeed delayed the timing at which students start their job search, at least during the sample period. In particular, the time at which students begin their job search was delayed by eight weeks on average. Interestingly, the timing at which firms offer positions to students remained relatively stable, even after the guideline revision. Consequently, market participants had to search under a shorter search horizon. To identify the impact of the delayed timing and shorter search horizon, I also exploit the differential program intensity across regions. Because the impact of the revision was severer in regions where job search timing had been initially moved forward, the different extent of timing changes can be used to identify the consequence of delaying the timing of job searches. To adopt this identification variation, this paper estimates difference-in-differences (DID) models, which is also complemented with the instrumental variable (IV) approach. The identification of estimating model relies on some important assumptions, and these are also examined.====Surprisingly, the analyses reveal that the guideline revision had a positive and relatively large effect on the job placement rate, that is, the employment rate at graduation. The result is robust to several potential threats to the underlying identification assumption. For instance, the DID with the program intensity approach entails a fuzziness in the treatment definition, thereby masking the true causal effect (Chaisemartin and Haultfoeuille, 2017). By looking at the heterogeneous impacts across college types, the results confirm that the effect is concentrated and stronger among colleges that are less likely to deviate from the treatment status and thus, less likely to be switchers. While a rather fuzzy design prevents us from obtaining a precise point estimate, the conservative specifications in the IV approach suggest that the revision increased the job placement rate by 4 percentage points (mean job placement rate = 0.568). On the contrary, I find little evidence that students significantly increased their human capital investment. In particular, the third-year (i.e., junior) students about to enter the job market did not increase the number of days they spent on campus, number of books purchased, hours of reading, or their intention to study abroad. Rather, second-year (i.e., sophomore) students are ==== likely to be on campus, reflecting students’ strategy to postpone timing to take classes in the expectation of having more time in the second semester of the junior year than students prior to the revision did.====The positive impact on the job placement rate has several potential interpretations. This paper adopts a simple matching framework (Blanchard, Diamond, 1989, Pissarides, 2000) and offers one plausible interpretation that the estimated effect is driven by a thick market externality. Intuitively, the timing regulation made local job markets thick in the sense that employers were forced to concentrate vacancy openings in the months after the first date specified in the revision. The thickness of the market generates a positive externality if the intensified vacancy openings make job searches easy for applicants. For example, thick job markets may allow more various types of job openings to be accessible to applicants. Job search intermediaries may also offer more efficient services because of the accumulated vacancies. Applicants then have more opportunities to examine employers and face higher chances that a potential match exists, thereby increasing the probability of being placed in a position by the end of the job market cycle. If this is the case, the positive impact on the job placement rate reflects a thick market externality owing to the guideline revision. In other words, the aggregate matching function exhibits increasing returns to scale, and the intensified vacancy postings per month leads to an increase in the overall matches due to increased efficiency of matching technology. Complementary analyses in this paper obtain results consistent with this idea. By adopting the same DID framework, I find that the guideline revision did not significantly change the number of vacancies posted by employers ====. Given that the guideline revision reduced the search horizon, this indicates that the number of vacancies ==== increased after the guideline revision. I also find that the revision had no negative impact on proxies for students’ aggregate search efforts per period for the months after the specified first date of a job search, although the evidence is admittedly crude. Although this paper does not identify the underlying mechanism per se, the results point to one possibility that the revision generated a positive externality effect on the job placement rate by making local job markets thick.====Few studies thus far have quantified the consequence of early job searches in entry-level labor markets. Niederle and Roth (2009) find that the introduction of centralized matching in the new gastroenterology fellow market has increased the mobility of fellows between hospitals and cities. However, their study focuses on the impact of introducing a matching algorithm rather than the timing regulation itself, thus providing less evidence on markets that have traditionally failed to establish strong market intermediaries, such as the market for federal court clerkships in the United States. On the contrary, the evidence derived from the US law school market is limited to descriptive analyses despite numerous attempts to regulate job search timing (Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, et al., 2007, Avery, Jolls, Posner, Roth, 2001). This paper provides one of the first evidence on the effects of changing job search horizon in entry-level labor markets.====This paper also contributes to the literature on the search and matching framework. Many studies have estimated the degrees of returns to scale in the matching technology for aggregate labor markets.==== Using city-level density information in the US, Bleakley and Lin (2012) observed evidence consistent with an increasing-returns-to-scale matching function, particularly highlighting the idea that the thick market externality is intensified among younger workers. While applied theoretical studies often assume constant returns to scale in their matching functions a priori, the degrees of returns to scale remain an empirical question.==== Findings on new college graduates in Japan add suggestive evidence supporting the hypothesis that labor markets for young workers are likely to exhibit a greater thick market externality.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

The recent research in the U.S. labor market analyzed the dynamics of unemployment (the extensive margin of labor adjustment) using a three-state model, where individuals move across employment, unemployment and nonparticipation. Borowczyk-Martins and Lalé (2019) extended this framework to encompass the intensive margin of labor adjustment. They showed that cyclical fluctuations in average hours per worker are predominantly driven by the behavior of part-time employment and used a four-state model of worker flows (by separating the employment state into part-time an full-time employment) to describe those dynamics. In this paper we extend this literature further by analyzing the dynamics of involuntary part-time employment.====The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States defines involuntary part-time employment (or part-time for economic reasons) as a state in which individuals want to work full-time but currently work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job or face slack work conditions in their current job. In recent years interest in these fluctuations has mounted on both sides of the Atlantic, as the share of individuals working part-time involuntarily increased spectacularly during the Great Recession in the U.S. and in the majority of European economies (see Canon et al. (2014) and Borowczyk-Martins (2017)). Fig. 1 shows the series of U.S. unemployment and involuntary part-time employment rates since 1955 until today. Both series exhibit a stable pattern of large countercyclical variation around recessions. Fluctuations in the two labor market rates capture a key aspect of the effect of the business cycle on the labor market: during recessions large number of workers supply less labor to the market than they would like to.====Our study of fluctuations in involuntary part-time employment is organized around two main questions. First, what are the cyclical patterns of worker flows in and out of involuntary part-time employment? What is their relative importance in driving the recessionary spikes and subsequent falls in involuntary part-time employment visible in Fig 1? Second, are fluctuations in the ins and outs of involuntary part-time employment different from those of unemployment? Is turnover between involuntary part-time employment and unemployment over the business cycle quantitatively important? To answer these questions, we measure transition probabilities across five labor market states (full-time employment, voluntary part-time employment, involuntary part-time employment, unemployment and nonparticipation) consistently from 1976 until today. Our analysis uncovers several results. First, we find that involuntary part-time employment is a very transitory labor market state and its cyclical variation is overwhelmingly driven by within-employment reallocation (transitions to and from full-time and voluntary part-time employment). Second, fluctuations in involuntary part-time employment flows exhibit systematic patterns over the business cycle. During recessions, involuntary part-time employment increases due to an increase in inflows from other employment states and by a drop in outflows to other employment states. As recoveries get underway, low outflows to other employment states become a more important driver of involuntary part-time employment dynamics. In the two most recent recessions the role of inflows from other employment states is greater compared to earlier recessions and is accompanied by a substantial increase in workers who report slack work conditions as their main reason for working part-time involuntarily. Third, turnover between involuntary part-time employment and unemployment is low and only moderately cyclical, hence, it plays no major role in the cyclical dynamics of the two labor market rates.====The point of departure of our investigation is data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which has informed the majority of studies on worker flows in the U.S. labor market. The distinction between voluntary and involuntary part-time work in the CPS introduces two measurement challenges that we address in this paper. The first concerns a break in the series of involuntary part-time employment stocks and flows. The basic monthly (BM) survey underwent a significant redesign in January 1994, which, among other things, introduced a tighter concept of involuntary part-time employment. From 1994 onwards to be counted as an involuntary part-time worker individuals must state that they want to work full-time. We propose a novel adjustment protocol that allows us to extend the monthly time series of involuntary part-time employment stocks and flows based on the post-1994 definitions back to 1976. Our approach can be described in two steps. In the first step, we adjust the levels of the series of BM stocks. We combine them with the series of part-time employment stocks calculated using the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the CPS to predict the correct BM series prior to 1994. The underlying assumption is that the close comovement between the post-1994 ASEC and BM time series is the same in the pre-1994 period. In the second step, we adjust the series of flows. Specifically, we correct the pre-1994 flows by targeting the dynamics of the series of stocks estimated in the first step using a margin-error (or raking) procedure. Both adjustment steps work well in practice, and we conduct several exercises to assess the robustness and plausibility of our estimates.====The second measurement challenge arises from the fact that, while conceptually distinct, workers’ classification between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment in the CPS is fuzzy. This opens the possibility that an individual’s report of part-time employment status is misclassified. It is well-known at least since Abowd and Zellner (1985) and Poterba and Summers (1986) that small levels of misclassification, with negligible effects on the estimates of stocks, can produce large biases in estimates of worker flows. The elevated levels of flows between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment motivates us to assess the hypothesis that some transitions within part-time employment are spurious. To gauge the effects of potentially spurious transitions within part-time employment, we apply a reclassification approach similar to Elsby et al. (2015). We find that our reclassification approach substantially reduces the amount of turnover within part-time employment, as well as its cyclicality. However, it leaves the substantive conclusions of our analysis largely unchanged.====Having established our main empirical findings and assessed their robustness, we discuss how they relate to, and can be informative for, research in macroeconomics of the labor market. The main takeaway from our analysis is that fluctuations in involuntary part-time employment provide different, and hence complementary, information on labor market adjustment compared to unemployment fluctuations. In a typical recession, involuntary part-time employment increases, and remains elevated during the recovery, mainly because employed workers are more likely to move to involuntary part-time work and less likely to do the reverse transition. Using post-1994 data, we further show that turnover between other employment states and involuntary part-time employment takes place overwhelmingly at the same employer. In other words, the cyclical dynamics of involuntary part-time employment seems to be, not only a ==== phenomenon, but mostly a ==== one. Therefore, we argue that cyclical fluctuations in involuntary part-time employment reflect the operation of a distinct labor-adjustment channel compared to job creation and destruction, which drives the cyclical dynamics of unemployment. This cautions against a popular interpretation that high levels of involuntary part-time work during and after recessions are a sign of weak creation of new full-time employment opportunities. In contrast, our analysis points to elevated involuntary part-time employment as evidence of continued fragility of ongoing employment relationships.====This paper contributes to the empirical literature on U.S. labor market dynamics. Our findings on unemployment fluctuations reinforce the main conclusions of the more recent literature (see Elsby et al. (2009), Fujita and Ramey (2009), Shimer (2012) and Elsby et al. (2015)). While our substantive findings on involuntary part-time employment fluctuations were documented by Canon et al. (2014) in post-1994 data (and have since been confirmed independently by us, Lariau (2017) and Warren (2017)), we show that they are also present in earlier recessions and that they are robust to adjustments for potentially spurious transitions and time aggregation bias.==== Furthermore, different from those papers, we decompose the cyclical variation of involuntary part-time employment using the method developed by Elsby et al. (2015), which also accounts for out-of-steady-state dynamics. Borowczyk-Martins and Lalé (2019) (BML19) quantified the importance of the ==== of involuntary part-time employment flows to the dynamics of part-time employment since 1976 by combining data from the BM files and the Outgoing Rotation Group samples of the CPS. The present paper estimates the ==== of voluntary and involuntary part-time employment inflows and outflows before the CPS redesign break, allowing us to conduct a systematic analysis of fluctuations in involuntary part-time employment. More generally, an important motivation for this paper is to provide economists with useful information for developing, calibrating or quantitatively assessing models of cyclical labor adjustment featuring both margins of labor adjustment. To that end, we are making the dataset used in this paper available from our personal webpages. We hope that our new estimates of involuntary part-time employment stocks and flows covering several U.S. recessions, and the empirical moments produced by our variance decompositions, will be used to further advance knowledge on cyclical labor market dynamics.====In addition to the empirical contribution, our approach to deal with the 1994 CPS redesign adds to existing approaches proposed by Elsby et al. (2009) and Shimer (2012). The standard approach in the literature to deal with the 1994 redesign of the CPS consists of using the adjustment factors provided in Polivka and Miller (1998) (henceforth PM98) to correct pre-1994 series.==== PM98 estimate adjustment factors for various aggregate measures (including involuntary part-time employment) based on data from a parallel survey run by the BLS from July 1992 through May 1994 aimed specifically at estimating the effect of the 1994 CPS redesign. A limitation of this approach is the assumption that the effect of the redesign on a given series does not depend on the levels of that series during the period spanned by the BLS parallel survey. Another limitation is practical: PM98 estimated adjustment factors only for certain aggregates measures and the BLS parallel survey necessary for their approach is confidential. By contrast, at the cost of assuming that the relationship between the ASEC and the BM series remains unchanged across the 1994 redesign, our approach allows adjustment factors to vary from year to year, and it can be used to construct adjustment factors for measures not available in PM98.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data we use to measure involuntary part-time employment stocks and flows. In Section 3 we present our measurement framework and describe the two steps of our adjustment protocol to address the CPS redesign break. Section 4 establishes the basic properties of the ins and outs of involuntary part-time employment. In Section 5, we examine closely flows within part-time employment and assess the effects of removing potentially spurious transitions. Sections 6 and 7 presents our findings regarding the interaction between involuntary part-time work, unemployment and full-time employment, while Section 8 discusses the relevance of those findings for research in macroeconomics of the labor market.

Indeed, the aggregate productivity growth of an industry or country may stem not only from an improved use of resources within firms, but also from a better allocation of resources across them, i.e. from capital and labor finding their most productive use (Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2013, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009, Olley, Pakes, 1996). Allocative efficiency depends, in turn, on the implementation of appropriate policies that encourage productive inputs to flow to more efficient firms. Some papers have then explicitly focused on possible policy-induced frictions, which prevent factors from reallocating towards more productive firms, and can thus be the source of observed variations in aggregate economic outcomes (Andrews, Cingano, 2014, Hopenhayn, Rogerson, 1993, Petrin, Sivadasan, 2013).====In line with this recent literature, this paper investigates the role of labor market reforms in influencing the allocation of inputs across heterogeneous production units. Since the launch of the euro area, many reforms have been adopted across European countries with the aim of improving the flexibility of the labor market and easing employment protection legislation for workers with temporary contracts (Boeri, 2011). Similarly to other European countries, a battery of labor reforms was implemented in Italy at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, from the Treu reform package, introduced in 1997, to the Biagi law, issued in 2003.==== Our paper focuses on the institutional changes in two different types of contracts: the fixed-term, regulated by Decree 368/2001, and the apprenticeship, regulated by the Biagi Law. The implementation of both measures varies across regions and sectors and, to a lesser extent, over time, allowing the exploitation of this plausibly exogenous variation to identify the impact of these labor market policies through a difference-in-differences approach.====Using data for all Italian limited liability manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2010, and following the methodology proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996), we quantify allocative efficiency by decomposing sectoral aggregate productivity into an unweighted average term and a size-productivity covariance term (OP covariance hereafter). The analysis provides evidence that regulations affecting labor markets do influence OP covariance, i.e. the extent to which resources are allocated across production units, although the specific effects depend on the policy considered.====Regarding the apprenticeship reform, our results suggest that there is a significantly positive relationship between the implementation of the law and allocative efficiency: the OP covariance term increased, on average, approximately by 5% in sectors-regions subject to the reform.==== By implementing an event study model, that allows us to explore the timing of the effects, we observe that the impact of the reform has not been instantaneous but rather increased over time. Moreover, we observe some heterogeneous effects across sectors and regions: a greater marginal impact is observed among industries and areas where there is a relatively greater share of white-collar workers.====We propose to rationalize the reduced-form results through a simple theoretical framework where the apprenticeship contract reform allows to perform firm-based training in place of external training. This can have beneficial effects, both in terms of improved training efficiency and increased probability of turning trained apprentices into permanent workers, especially in more productive firms. As a result, the most efficient firms expand and gain market shares, implying an increase in the covariance between size and productivity at the aggregate level.====As far as the fixed-term contract reform is concerned, the results indicate that, on average, there are no effects in terms of allocative efficiency: the estimated coefficients for both the difference-in-differences and the event study models are not statistically significant. However, we observe that the average effect hides a great heterogeneity among geographical areas. In particular, our empirical analysis detects that in regions where labor court disputes are longer, and therefore potential legal expenses higher for firms, the reform has a negative and statistically significant effect in terms of the OP covariance, while the effect is positive among those regions where court disputes are less lengthy. This finding, which is in line with the evidence provided by Cappellari et al. (2012) on firms’ productivity, can be rationalized within our conceptual framework by the presence of two counteracting forces. On the one hand, as the reform allows a longer tenure at the workplace to fixed-term workers, this can have beneficial effects in terms of learning-by-doing, favoring in particular more productive firms which then gain market shares. On the other hand, the presence of costly and lengthy dispute-settlement procedures, in particular in certain regions, can actually push in the opposite direction and offset these gains.====Our paper relates to various strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature that links cross-country differences in aggregate productivity to the (mis)allocation of resources across firms (Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2009, Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2013, Hsieh, Klenow, 2009). In a seminal paper, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) assess the role of resource misallocation in accounting for cross-country gaps in aggregate productivity in China and India, compared to the United States. Their estimates suggest that if China and India were able to align the efficiency of their resource allocation to that observed in the United States, manufacturing productivity could rise by 30–50% in China and 40-60% in India. Following Hsieh and Klenow (2009), several other empirical analyses provide evidence of the important role played by reallocation in explaining aggregate productivity differences between countries or industries (See Andrews, Cingano, 2014, Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2009, Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, 2013, among others). As for Italy, the recent works by Calligaris (2015) and Linarello and Petrella (2017) also highlight a relevant role for allocative efficiency in shaping aggregate productivity dynamics.====While most of these papers take an agnostic view as to the specific underlying frictions and distortions that can induce the observed misallocation of resources, a parallel line of research focuses more explicitly on the effect of specific policies in promoting or inhibiting the reallocation of factors from less to more productive firms. To this respect, frictions in product, labor, and credit markets have all been considered as possible sources of misallocation (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2013).====Focusing on labor market imperfections, the knowledge base for assessing the links among employment regulations, labor flows, and resource allocation is still limited and not clear-cut. As far as employment protection legislation (EPL) is concerned, some theoretical models suggest that as long as EPL raises labor adjustment costs, it is likely to have a negative impact on efficient workforce adjustments and on the allocation of resources, with negative implications for aggregate economic outcomes (Bentolila and Bertola, 1990). Labor market frictions that have explicitly been studied as potential sources of resource misallocation include hiring and firing costs, and size–dependent policies (Guner, Ventura, Xu, 2008, Hopenhayn, Rogerson, 1993, Lagos, 2006). From an empirical point of view, a number of studies have found consistent evidence of a negative effect of EPL on allocative efficiency (Andrews, Cingano, 2014, Bassanini, Nunziata, Venn, 2009, Gonzàlez, Miles-Touya, 2012, Hopenhayn, Rogerson, 1993, Petrin, Sivadasan, 2013). Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993), building and calibrating a general equilibrium model of the firm-level labor reallocation process, show that firing taxes distort the allocation of labor across establishments, and quantify total factor productivity (TFP) losses from these taxes on the order of about 5%. Petrin and Sivadasan (2013) and Gonzàlez and Miles-Touya (2012) assess the degree of resource misallocation at the firm level, and look at the reduced-form effect of a change in severance payments on allocative efficiency. Some studies look at the effect of the adoption of specific types of temporary contracts on firm-level efficiency, showing either a positive or a negative relationship (Autor, Kerr, Kugler, 2007, Cappellari, Dell’Aringa, Leonardi, 2012, Dolado, Ortigueira, Stucchi, 2016, Engellandt, Riphahn, 2005). Our paper contributes to the line of research that looks at the impact of labor market policies, by specifically considering the effects that the reforms of temporary contracts applied in Italy at the beginning of the century have had on aggregate productivity through their impact on resource allocation.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the two main reforms that were implemented at the beginning of the century, and sketches a conceptual framework useful for rationalizing the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the dataset used in the empirical analysis, and the approach we follow to measure the extent of allocative efficiency. Section 4 presents some preliminary evidence on the effects of the two reforms on firms’ size and productivity. Section 5 focuses on the analysis of the relationship between the implementation of the reforms and the degree of allocative efficiency.

Initially, we present an index of on-the-job human ==== (OJHCA) based on data from the ","In recent decades, the skills the workforce requires have become increasingly more demanding, with business and employees alike having to adapt to more increasingly complex technologies (see, OECD, 2006, OECD, 2010, OECD, 2011). In this regard, participating in job training activities and learning on-the-job have gained importance, since these activities enable workers to update their competencies and acquire new skills which are, more often than not, compensated in the labor market (see, OECD, 2010, OECD, 2013). Beyond the positive effects these activities have on productivity, they also make the workplace more attractive for workers, increasing their motivation, participation and, consequently, boost the employment rate (Grip, 2008, OECD, 2004). Even though the relevance for policy-makers to have empirical evidence concerning such issues, there are very few papers studying the economic impact that informal learning process has in the workplace. Most papers, following seminal studies in human capital theory (e.g., Arrow, 1962, Mincer, 1962) focus on experience as a proxy of learning in the workplace. These studies show that work experience (as a proxy of learning in the workplace and learning-by-doing) has been a key determinant of workers’ economic outcomes.====In this paper we explore the role human capital and, in particular, on-the-job human capital acquisition (formally and informally) have in explaining differences in employment rates across OECD economies. We use data from the OECD Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) that, through a number of questions, allows us to identify formal and informal learning in the workplace in OECD countries. Then, we build a dynamic model of the labor market that replicates the patterns we find and some non-targeted moments. Finally, we use the model to evaluate a public policy consisting in subsidize formal training activities.====First, using the PIAAC data, we construct an index of on-the-job human capital acquisition (OJHCA). This index combines two other indexes, on-the-job training index and on-the-job learning index. The former comprises formal on-the-job training sessions or training activities, while the latter includes the learning of new work-related competencies gained through the interaction between co-workers and supervisors (i.e. informal learning) and from the tasks workers perform on their own (i.e. learning-by-doing).====Second, we build an augmented search and matching model with on-the-job human capital acquisition that depends on both on-the-job training and learning. As search and matching models are workhorses for analyzing the labor markets, these models are suitable for our objective because, as shown by Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999, Acemoglu, Pischke, 1999, companies find it optimal to offer general training to workers in the presence of frictions in the labor market, contrasting with Becker (1964) results in a perfect labor market set-up. The idea is that firms make higher profits from trained workers because their wage increases are less than productivity increases. In our model, workers acquire skills in an initial stage and either become fully-trained employees or are dismissed. Acquiring skills is costly for both, the firm and the worker, the firm spends resources on training workers and the worker makes an effort to learn. Moreover, training activities encourage workers to increase their learning in the workplace, since the wage increases will offset the costs of learning and the part of the training costs transferred from their respective firms. Only fully-trained workers can transfer their acquired skills on-the-job to another firm. However, if they separate from the job, they may lose their human capital either due to the unemployment duration (as in Ortego-Marti, 2016) or because the unemployed workers find a job in a different occupation (as in Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009).====The model also incorporates payroll taxes and education as factors that affect, among others, on-the-job human capital investment. On the one hand, payroll taxes are negatively correlated with employment rates and the human capital acquisition index. In our model, not only do taxes increase employment opportunity costs (e.g. Prescott, 2004) but they also increase the implicit marginal cost of learning. Consequently, the worker’s incentive to learn on-the-job drops and, due to its complementarity, so too does the level of training provided by the firm. On the other hand, formal education increases labor productivity, which increases the net returns of firm’s training investments and reduces the workers effort to learn. An increase in formal education can also be interpreted as reduction in the implicit marginal costs of training and learning, which is in line with the observed complementarity between on-the-job training and formal education found in previous studies (see, e.g. Cairó and Cajner, 2018).====Third, to quantify the effect on-the-job human capital acquisition has on employment, we calibrate the model using the United Kingdom (UK) as our benchmark economy. Then, we decompose the effects of education and payroll taxes to account for the differences in on-the-job human capital acquisition, productivity and employment. The model with exogenous variation in education and payroll taxes accounts for 39.2% of the observed gap between countries in the highest and the lowest tertiles of the OJHCA, and 62.3% of the employment gap between these two groups of countries. In an additional exercise, we allow countries to differ in terms of their marginal costs of training and learning; specifically, we simulate the observed cross-country differences in the OJHCA index by adjusting the marginal costs of training and learning and compare the model’s predictions for the employment rate with actual data. That is, on top of education and payroll taxes, we assume country-specific policies that determine the levels of training and learning as given. The model with differences in marginal costs is able to reproduce 87.7% of the differences in employment rates between the groups of countries in the highest and lowest tertiles of the OJHCA distribution, and OJHCA accounts for 40.2% of these differences. Furthermore, the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual values of employment is less than 5 p.p. in 16 out of 26 OECD countries. The model also correctly predicts the cross-country patterns between education and employment (and labor productivity), and does a very good job at replicating the relations between taxes and employment (and labor productivity). We take these predictions as validation of our model, therefore, we think that our model is useful tool to analyze the relationships between human capital, taxes and employment.====Finally, we evaluate a public policy consisting in a subsidy of the marginal costs of training with the aim to foster human capital investment and employment. The subsidy not only encourages training, but also boosts workers to learn in the workplace, thus further increasing their on-the-job acquired human capital. We find that a 10% cut in marginal costs of training increases employment by almost 0.5 p.p. We also find that a training subsidy has a lower impact in a sclerotic labor market than in flexible one, the main reason is that workers spend more time in unemployment in an economy with low labor market flows.====This paper has obvious parallels with studies documenting a positive association between on-the-job training and employment. In a broader ranging report, the OECD (OECD, 2004) presents evidence of a positive relationship between job training participation and aggregate employment rates after controlling for formal education, GDP growth and labor market institutions.====Beyond formal training, some scholars have focused on the role of workplace learning. Barron et al. (1997) show the importance of these learning processes in the U.S., specifically, they document that, during the first quarter following the hiring of a new worker, more than one-third of training (54.5 hours) is provided through a so-called ‘learning by watching co-workers’ process, while the other two-thirds correspond mainly to formal sessions of on-the-job training or training activities provided by supervisors and co-workers. In the same vein, Bishop (1996) finds that learning-by-doing plays an important role in the increase in employee productivity during the first two years of job tenure in a firm. Thus, learning through experience and learning from co-workers and supervisors would appear to capture the essence of on-the-job learning.====More recently, some studies stressed that workers are continuously learning in the workplace (i.e., learning from co-workers and supervisors and learning-by-doing) and that has a positive effect on productivity and, subsequently, on economic performance (e.g. De Grip, 2015, Destré, Lévy-Garboua, Sollogoub, 2008, Ferreira, de Grip, van der Velden, 2018, Ferreira, Künn-Nelen, Grip, 2017, Grip, 2008). In particular, Ferreira et al. (2017) document empirical evidence of complementarity between on-the-job training and on-the-job learning in an European context. Despite differences in the intensity in informal learning between temporary and permanent employees, using PIAAC data, Ferreira et al. (2018) corroborate complementarity between on-the-job training and on-the-job learning regardless the type of contract.====Our paper contributes to this literature since, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that use a search and matching model to study the dual effects of on-the-job training and workers’ on-the-job learning decisions on employment rates across OECD economies. Thus, we believe that our model is a good instrument to improve the understanding of how the different components (training and learning) of on-the-job human capital acquisition affect the labor market.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our on-the-job training, learning and human capital acquisition indexes. Section 3 presents the model and Section 4 contains the calibration and main quantitative exercises.

By comparing two wage setting scenarios, we show that a two-tier bargaining scheme, where a fraction of the ==== is negotiated at firm level, raises the amount of investment per worker in the economy compared to a one-tier bargaining scheme, in which earnings are entirely negotiated at sectoral level. In two-tier schemes wages depend on the labour productivity at firm level. This reduces the expected duration of a vacancy for capital intensive firms, as they attract a larger number of job seekers. Capital remains unused for less time, boosting investment in the first place. The model’s main result is consistent with the positive correlation between investment per worker and the presence of a two-tier bargaining agreement that we find in a representative sample of Italian firms.","There is an important literature in labour economics that looks at the effects of unions on firm performance (see the recent contribution by Doucouliagos et al. (2017)). This body of research emphasises the role of the wage bargaining environment in which unions operate as a potential key determinant of firm behaviour and labour market outcomes.====Indeed, the role of unions is likely to be different in centralised versus decentralised bargaining systems, in coordinated versus non-coordinated environments or when bargaining takes place both at the sector (centralised) and firm (decentralised) level, the so-called two-tier bargaining system (Boeri, 2014), which grants some degree of flexibility to firms and unions to deviate from terms decided at higher level agreements (Garnero, 2020). Interestingly, despite the increasing importance over time of multi-level (two-tier) bargaining arrangements in a number of European countries, their economic effects on employment, productivity and investment are still poorly understood, as highlighted by Addison (2016); Boeri (2014); Hijzen et al. (2019). Survey data for a representative sample of Italian firms, which we discuss in more detail in Section 3, reveal the existence of a negative correlation between the level of investment per worker and the presence of unions within the firm, which is however fully offset by the presence of a two-tier wage bargaining agreement.====To address these issues, in this paper we build up a model in which there are unions and labour markets present frictions. Firms, that differ in terms of total factor productivity, choose the amount of investment in capital equipment before a job vacancy is filled and the wage negotiation occurs. So an hold-up problem arises, whose effects on firms’ investment decision are compounded by the presence of labour market frictions. Indeed, the longer the expected duration of a job vacancy, the larger is the opportunity cost of unused capital, and the lower the incentive to invest in the first place.====We compare the effects on capital investment of two different wage mechanisms: a one-tier bargaining system, fully centralised, and a two-tier scenario, in which a fraction of the salary is negotiated at firm level.==== We show that, if some conditions are fulfilled, the two-tier wage negotiation raises the level of investment per worker in the economy. The reason goes as follows. While under one-tier bargaining wages are affected by the average labour productivity in the sector, in a two-tier bargaining scenario the salary partially depends on the productivity of the single firm. More capital intensive firms, that pay higher wages, face a lower expected duration for a vacancy, as better earnings attract more job seekers. In turn, if job positions get filled more rapidly capital remains unused for less time. The hold up problem is less severe and investment increases. Of course, the same chain of effects, but with opposite sign, occurs for less capital intensive firms, that may decide to invest less under a two-tier bargaining scheme. However, we show that when the real interest rate is close to zero, the higher opportunity cost of capital for this type of firms is never strong enough to outweigh the increase in investment for capital intensive firms. In the end, the amount of capital equipment per worker in the economy goes up.====We contribute to the literature, which is surveyed in detail in the next section, in two main directions. First, we propose a theoretical model with unions and two-tier bargaining that is able to deliver general empirical predictions on capital investment. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the very few attempts to model two-tier bargaining structures available in the literature. Second, we provide descriptive evidence on the effects of unions and two-tier wage bargaining on investment for the case of a country, Italy, traditionally characterized by high union power and highly centralised wage bargaining, while most of the available evidence is for the US or for a very limited number of EU countries, as the UK and Germany.====The remainder of the study is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the relation of our paper to the previous literature, in Section 3 we provide motivating evidence, in Sections 4 and 5 we present the theoretical model, while Section 6 concludes.

Today an entrepreneur with a postgraduate degree earns on average $100,000 a year more than one with a college degree. The difference more than doubles at the higher quantiles of the income distribution. In the late 1980s, differences were close to zero. The rise in the postgraduate premium is mainly due to increased complementarity between higher education and past labor market experience.","There is widespread evidence that the return to education for employees has increased over recent decades in most industrialized countries (see for example Card (1999) for a review), while we know very little—if anything—on the evolution of the return to education for entrepreneurs. The anecdotal evidence is somewhat mixed. On the one hand, some of the most successful new US companies, such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple, have been founded by college drop-outs: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs. This could indicate that higher education has become less useful to entrepreneurship, possibly because of its high opportunity cost in terms of time. On the other hand, successful entrepreneurs with little or no formal education have been common throughout the history of capitalism.==== And in more recent years, the US has also experienced a boom in the number of successful high-tech firms created by entrepreneurs with postgraduate education, which might rather suggest an increase in its return for entrepreneurs.====In this paper we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to supply evidence on the evolution of the return to education of US entrepreneurs over the period 1989–2013. The SCF is best suited for the purpose because it is fully representative of the wealth distribution of US households, including at the very top; it measures accurately the educational level of individuals; and it contains detailed information of the businesses they run.==== We identify entrepreneurs as individuals whose primary job consists of actively managing one or more privately-held businesses, which they own in part or in full. We also consider more restrictive definitions of entrepreneur based on the number of workers in the business and its legal form (incorporated versus unincorporated). In measuring the return to entrepreneurship, we consider that an important part of entrepreneurs’ income comes from capital gains realized upon selling the business. An entrepreneur also immobilizes part of his wealth as well as his human capital in his business. Upon exit (due to failure or sale), the entrepreneur recovers some wealth that can be re-invested elsewhere or consumed, while the human capital can be re-employed in the labor market. Based on this insight, we construct a simple measure of ==== and implement it using the SCF, which consists of repeated cross-sectional surveys with information on the date of start-up, current income from the entrepreneurial venture (in the form of either labor income or dividend payments), its current market valuation and the investment made to acquire or start the business. We group entrepreneurs by education, distinguishing between: (i) post-graduate degree, (ii) college degree, (iii) high school degree, and (iv) less than high school degree. We find that the premium of having a college degree relative to a high school degree has increased, but only by about as much as the analogous premium for employees. Instead, the premium for postgraduate education has increased substantially more for entrepreneurs than for employees. On average, entrepreneurs with a post-graduate degree nowadays earn more than twice as much as in the early 1990s. The analogous percentage increase for entrepreneurs with a college degree is around 50%, while for entrepreneurs with less than a college degree the increase is small or negligible. Today an entrepreneur with a postgraduate degree earns on average $100,000 per year more (at 2010 prices) than one with only a college degree. This difference more than doubles at the higher quantiles of the entrepreneurs’ income distribution. In the late 1980s, these differences were close to zero. The sharp increase in the skill premium for entrepreneurs with postgraduate education is partly due to the higher dividends paid by the firms they ran and partly due to the higher capital gains realized upon sale of the business. The premium for postgraduate education holds both for entrepreneurs with an M.A. or an MBA degree and for those with a Ph.D; it has remained high during the Great Recession (despite a drop in absolute returns); and it is robust to accounting for changes in how individuals self-select into higher education and/or entrepreneurship. All this suggests that the experience of “Bill, Mark and Steve” has been the exception rather than the rule and that higher education has become increasingly important for entrepreneurial success.====An increase in the return to skill for entrepreneurs can be the result of an increase in the return to education, in the return to labor market experience and in the complementarity between the two (EE-complementarity). We find that the complementarity between higher education and labor market experience has increased substantially. The increase is specific to entrepreneurship and accounts almost fully for the rise in the premium to postgraduate education. This holds true after controlling for several alternative explanations for the rise in the premium, including changes in (i) the sectoral specialization of businesses; (ii) their access to internal or external finance; (iii) the importance of vintage technology effects; (iv) the intergenerational transmission of wealth; (v) compensating differentials—due to greater business risk or lower possibilities of recycling entrepreneurial skills into new ventures; and (vi) the scale of business. The rising importance of EE-complementarity is consistent with a recent literature which, following Lazear, 2004, Lazear, 2005, has emphasized that entrepreneurs need a balanced mix of skills to succeed and with the findings by Azoulay et al. (2018) that highly successful start-ups tend to be founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs with some previous labor market experience.====There is cross-sectional evidence on the return to education for entrepreneurs and how it compares with the analogous return for employees, see Van der Sluis et al. (2008) for a review of the literature and Queiro (2016) for a more recent analysis which focuses on firm dynamics. Yet little is known about the time-series evolution of the skill premium for entrepreneurs. Some existing evidence is consistent with our findings that the return to education has increased. Kaplan and Rauh (2013) study the characteristics of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the US over the past three decades according to the Forbes 400 list and document that the share of college graduates has increased from 77 to 87%. Smith et al. (2019) provide evidence consistent with an increased return to skill for entrepreneurs, but they do not focus on education, which is a variable not available in the administrative data that they use.====There is debate on how to accurately identify entrepreneurship in the data, which according to Schumpeter, 1947, Schumpeter, 1949 is associated with job creation, innovation, and risk taking. Levine and Rubinstein (2017) use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) to argue that self-employed individuals who run incorporated businesses closer approximates the Schumpeterian definition of entrepreneur. Here we focus on the return to education in entrepreneurship, study its evolution over time and find that the return to postgraduate education has increased also when focusing on the preferred definition of entrepreneurs by Levine and Rubinstein (2017).====Hall and Woodward (2010) study the risk-adjusted return to entrepreneurship and conclude that it is only slightly above zero. Our measure of entrepreneurial return does not control for risk, but we think that risk aversion alone cannot explain the rising premium to higher education observed in the data, because the entire distribution of returns has generally become more favorable to highly educated entrepreneurs: failure rates have evolved similarly across educational groups, while the skill premium to entrepreneurship has increased in all the higher quantiles of the income distribution. Further, our results are robust to controlling for a measure of income uncertainty in the business.====Several other papers have used the SCF to study features of US entrepreneurs. De Nardi et al. (2007) investigate the role of liquidity constraints and personal wealth for business development. Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) and Kartashova (2014) estimate the aggregate return to private equity, which accrues mainly to entrepreneurs, and compare it to the return from investing in public equity. None of these papers has analyzed differences in individual entrepreneurial returns and the evolution over time of the return to education for entrepreneurs.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses how to measure the return to entrepreneurship in the SCF. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 characterizes the evolution of average returns and deal with selection issues into both higher education and entrepreneurship. Section 5 focuses on different quantiles of the entrepreneurs’ return distribution. Section 6 show the robustness of the results to possible biases in the measure of returns and the use of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) as an alterative source of information on entrepreneurial income. Section 7 provides evidence of increased complementarity between education and labor market experience and tests for alternative explanations of the rise in the premium for postgraduate education.

We present evidence that both contractual wage arrangements and cyclical match quality are a key feature of the German labor market. We show that parts of the excess wage cyclicality of new hires discussed by the literature can be explained by cyclical job ladder movements in match quality of new hires from employment. Guided by the literature of job reassignments, we additionally allow for variation in the match quality within an employer-employee match. Besides support for job-specific contracts, our novel main results show that much of the excess wage cyclicality of job changers can be explained by occupation switching workers.","Macroeconomic research shows that the introduction of wage rigidity to a search model greatly improves the model’s ability to generate quantitative features of the aggregate labor market (Hall, 2005, Shimer, 2005). However, evidence from micro-level data offers more nuanced insights with respect to the cyclicality of individual wages. Bils (1985) shows that wages of new hires are more cyclical than wages of job stayers. Beaudry and DiNardo (1991) (henceforth BD) find evidence for long-lasting wage contracts which shield workers from adverse conditions. Pissarides (2009) takes these findings as evidence for relatively flexible wages for new hires and less flexible wages thereafter. Kudlyak (2014) formulates a framework for measuring the wage component of the marginal cost of labor, which is found to be highly cyclical. These conclusions serve to invalidate many successful resolutions of the unemployment volatility puzzle, as many imply some sort of inertia in wages (Gertler, Trigari, 2009, Hagedorn, Manovskii, 2008, Hall, 2005). However, recent literature challenges these conclusions, highlighting the lack of proper correction for the composition bias in many empirical models.==== Hagedorn and Manovskii (2013) (henceforth HM) argue that past aggregate conditions appear to be important predictors of wages, while these variables actually proxy for unmeasured procyclical match quality. In a similar vein, Gertler et al. (2020) (henceforth GHT) argue that higher wage cyclicality of new hires reflects cyclical composition in match quality among job changers.====Against this background, we use comprehensive administrative matched employer-employee data to establish that both contractual wage arrangements and cyclical match quality seem to be a key feature of the German labor market. On the one hand, we find evidence for history dependent wages, supporting wage settings with contractual arrangements rather than models of pure spot wages. This finding is consistent with the institutional wage formation setting in Germany which is characterized by a high collective bargaining coverage. On the other hand, we find that wages of new hires from unemployment are not more cyclical, but those of job changers are more cyclical than those of existing workers once we account for composition effects as proposed by the literature. We argue that much, but not all of the excess wage cyclicality of new hires discussed by the literature can be explained by cyclical job ladder movements in match quality of new hires from employment. A key innovation of this paper is that we derive a novel measure of match quality within an employer-employee match (a generalization to HM’s approach), where we utilize detailed information on workers’ occupations. Within this framework, we find that much of the excess wage cyclicality for new hires can be explained by the occupational specifity, which is consistent with cyclical job-specific contractual arrangements within firms. If job ladder movements accompany a simultaneous change of a worker’s occupation, either across or at the same employers, the resulting wages are particularly cyclical sensitive.====We base our analysis on replications of the typical regressions in BD and Bils (1985). We confirm a significant procyclical relationship between past labor market conditions and contemporaneous wages — an indication for wage contracts. However, unlike BD, none of these indicators of past conditions outperform contemporaneous conditions. Furthermore, we confirm relatively cyclical entry wages of new hires as compared to the wages of existing workers.====Next, we turn towards the critique that the evidence for history dependence could reflect unobserved, cyclical match-specific productivity. We focus on two important approaches from the literature — HM and GHT. HM derive an approximation of the job match quality from an on-the-job-search model. Using the NLSY in the typical BD regressions, they indeed reject contract models in favor of spot wages. In a similar vein, GHT make the point that pooling all sorts of new hires conflates the wage flexibility of new hires from unemployment with procyclical improvements of match quality of new hires from employment in Bils-type regressions.====First, we use our administrative data for Germany to construct the indirect match quality controls as in HM. In contrast to HM, we still find an economically and statistically significant relation between past labor market conditions and contemporaneous wages, even after controlling for match quality. This finding is per se at odds with the spot wage assumption in HM. We argue that part of the impact of the history of labor market conditions on wages works indeed through the selection of better match qualities as the inclusion of the selection controls decreases the magnitude of the coefficients on the indicators for past labor market conditions. However, our results show that past labor market conditions carry independent information for current wages and hence deliver empirical support for models with history dependence in wages — an observation that might be driven by institutional country-specific settings.====Second, we follow GHT’s approach to directly disentangle the relative contribution of cyclical composition and wage cyclicality to estimates of excess wage cyclicality of new hires. In line with GHT, we find that wages of new hires from unemployment and those of workers in ongoing jobs are equally responsive to the cycle, while those of job changers are significantly more responsive. While the large confidence intervals in GHT’s point estimates leave some room for excess cyclicality of wages of new hires from unemployment, ours are much tighter, providing an important confirmation of GHT.====Third, to test by how much the greater cyclicality of wages for new hires reflects cyclicality in the composition of match quality across new hires from employment, we add the HM selection controls in the GHT regressions. We apply them separately to job stayers, new hires from unemployment, and job changers to measure how our previous estimates are affected by potential composition effects. We find that all our previous GHT estimates appear to be biased procyclically, with the largest selection effects for job changers. Interestingly, controlling for cyclical match quality makes the observation that wages of new hires from unemployment are not more cyclical than those of stayers even clearer. These results are aligned with the recent evidence that wages are more sensitive to changes in new job opportunities for employed workers than they are for unemployed workers (Karahan et al., 2017). However, these results appear to be in contrast to Haefke et al. (2013) who show that wages of new hires out of non-employment behave similarly to wages of job-to-job movers.==== While our findings are hard to square with the period-by-period Nash bargaining assumption of the canonical search and matching model, they are more consistent with a variety of search models which incorporate OJS in the spirit of Burdett and Mortensen (1998). These models often assume that the wage rate is set at the time of hiring, and firms and workers commit to this wage in the future. Other search models (e.g. Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2006, Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002) assume that firms can counter the offers received by their employees from competing firms. Hence, wages might increase in ongoing jobs due to incoming outside offers. We discuss our results in the light of the high degree of collective bargaining in Germany. We argue that these arrangements resemble particularly contracts with one-sided commitment. These results match previous evidence for contractual agreements found by Bellou and Kaymak (2012) and Grant (2003).====Guided by the literature of cyclical job reassignments and our previous findings, we then formulate a novel empirical framework that allows for job-specific contracts (as compared to employer-specific contracts). The general idea is that firms adjust their labor costs over the cycle not by altering wages for particular jobs, but rather by changing the assignment of workers to those jobs (see among others Hall, 1974, Reder, 1955, van Rens, 2005, Reynolds, 1951).==== To test whether job-specific arrangements matter for our results, we provide a generalization of HM’s match quality measures. The argument is that even within employer-employee matches, workers might select into better matches during good times through internal job reassignments (e.g., promotions), which we proxy by occupation changes. This refinement is important because the cyclical implications of implicit contracts, especially those of models with worker mobility, are observationally equivalent to the implications of cyclical intrafirm up- and downgrading. With our refinement, we clean the reference group of job stayers and exploit an additional source of cyclical variation that might confound previous results. Interestingly, our novel empirical framework shows that much of the excess cyclicality is driven by occupation switches. The largest selection effects go along the occupational dimension as workers who change occupations at the same employers are responsible for the largest portion of the procyclical bias in the estimated wage cyclicality. These results are consistent with Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2016) who find that procyclical wage improvements are larger for workers who change careers (e.g., occupation changes) than for workers who do not. Furthermore, they are aligned with Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) who show that occupation switching workers are particularly cyclically sensitive.====The plan of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data sources and preparation. Section 3 investigates the cyclical behavior of individual wages. In Subsections, we explore the role of composition bias and discuss our result in the light of the institutional wage settings in Germany. Section 4 explores the role of job reassignments.

The IV is a time-variant dummy indicating the counties that have relative early NCMS implementations. I also use the CHNS to construct a county-level dataset and replicate the county-level results. Together, the results suggest that the NCMS “locks” the rural labour force into rural areas and further hinders geographical job mobility in China.","Providing basic health care services to every citizen of China is one of the important responsibilities of the central government (Wang, 2009). In 2003, the central government initiated a new rural health insurance scheme to meet the health needs of the rural population, replacing an old policy which was largely ineffective. This scheme, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), provides coverage for catastrophic illnesses among the rural population and aims to prevent “poverty caused by illness” (Wagstaff et al., 2009) However, the policy puts a major geographical restriction on the reimbursement rate for medical expenses. The reimbursement rates for medical expenses vary according to the administrative region of the hospital(s) visited. Rural residents in China are eligible for high reimbursement rates only when they visit hospitals in the administrative region of their place of residence, as entered under the household registration system.====How might this policy restriction on health insurance distort the migrant labour market in China? This paper finds that the implementation of the NCMS hinders the number of rural residents who are rural-to-urban migrants and work in urban areas away from their hometown. However, from a first glance at the general statistics, the trend seems to be the opposite. During the implementation period of the NCMS (from 2003 to 2008), the number of migrants increased dramatically due to China’s rapid urbanization process and the increasing income differences between rural and urban workers. Despite the rapid economic development of urban areas in China, the social security system for rural-to-urban migrants was greatly underdeveloped during the 2000s and early 2010s. More than 70% of migrants in 2012 were still not enrolled in health or work injury insurance schemes within employment-based health insurance in the urban areas (Giles, Park, Wang, 2013, NBS, 2012). Rural-to-urban migrants are particularly vulnerable to health problems that might hinder their earning ability (Barber and Yao, 2010). Providing health insurance in rural areas fulfils rural-to-urban migrants’ need for a social safety net. But the geographical restriction brought by the health insurance might encourage these migrants to benefit from high reimbursement rates by staying close to their hometown, which is usually their place of residence in the household registration system.====This paper studies the unintended consequences of the implementation of the NCMS on the rural-to-urban migrant labour market in China. I provide new county-level evidence of the effects of implementing the NCMS on the rural-to-urban migration labour market in China. By collecting raw data of the rural-to-urban migrants from each county for 14 years from five provincial statistical yearbooks and the county implementation date of the NCMS from the newspapers, I use an event-study approach to test whether the gradual roll-out of the NCMS reduces the percentage of rural-to-urban migrants from different counties. Rural-to-urban migrants from a county are the county’s rural residents who are working in urban areas outside their home county. I call this percentage of rural-to-urban migrants at county level the ‘migration propensity’. The results show that implementing the NCMS reduces the migration propensity and its growth rate at the county-level. The negative effects on the migration propensity get larger with a longer NCMS implementation period, usually taking effect in and after the first year of the implementation.====As the results from county-level data, with their limited geographical coverage, might suffer from misreporting, I use a survey dataset, the China Nutrition and Health Survey (CHNS), to conduct an individual-level analysis. In this analysis, I examine the effects of the individual NCMS enrolment on the probability of being a rural-to-urban migrant. The instrumental variable method is my identification strategy for tackling the possible endogeneities between individual-level health insurance enrolment and the decision to migrate. I use the difference in the “pilot” timing for different counties as an IV for the individual-level enrolment. The results show that individual enrolment in the scheme reduces the probability of being a rural-to-urban migrant. Furthermore, I use the CHNS to construct a county-level dataset, and the results from this dataset provide comparable evidence for the results from the self-collected county dataset.====Similar effects of health insurance schemes on labour market distortion at the individual level have been noted in the U.S. context. Gruber and Madrian (1993) discuss the “job-lock” effect of employer-sponsored health insurance portability; other papers examine the effects of health insurance, mainly Medicare, on retirement decisions (Fairlie, Kapur, Gates, 2016, Gruber, Madrian, 1995). Results from the U.S. show that health insurance affects job-related decisions at the individual level. Some studies in the U.S. investigate the effect of health insurance on geographical mobility, but the effects found are small or insignificant. Chatterji and Li (2016) find that Medicaid expansion states attract the migration of low-income, childless adults, but the effects last only for one year. Goodman (2017) rules out the significance of health insurance effects on inter-state migration. This paper also links to the literature on welfare-induced migration. Borjas (1999) has found that immigrant welfare recipients in the U.S. are more likely to end up in high-benefit states. Others have also contributed to the literature by providing empirical evidence for similar conclusions, but mostly in developed countries (Blank, 1988, Gelbach, 2004, Giorgi, Pellizzari, 2009, McKinnish, 2005, McKinnish, 2007). Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016) conducted a study on migration in India; their structural model estimates whether the improvement of formal insurance on migrations, such as government safety nets and private credit, will double the migration rate. Barham and Kuhn (2014) also explore the negative effects of local health and family planning benefit programs on the flow of out-migration in local areas in Bangladash. However, given the growing number of internal migrants in developing countries, especially in China, whether health insurance schemes have similar effects on the labour markets in China is still an under-studied topic.====This paper addresses an important question: the unintended misallocation effects on the labour market from place-based policies. Focusing on China is highly relevant, given that the studied migrant group is one of the main and largest labour forces contributing to China’s recent development. To date, there has been almost no discussion of possible labour-market distortions caused by the NCMS. Qin and Zheng (2011) mention this issue, but the results are limited to an individual-level dataset with a restricted period and an identification strategy that does not fully identify possible individual endogeneities.==== This paper supplies this missing piece in the literature by providing both robust individual and county-level evidence from China, with clearer identification strategies, a longer time-span, and a newly-collected county dataset. The paper also finds that the distorted migration behaviours in China are on a larger scale than the similar behaviours in the U.S., which is likely due to higher average risk aversion level possessed by Asian people (Weber and Hsee, 1998). The results imply that the unintended consequences of health insurance policies for labour markets in developing countries may be greater than the literature on developed countries has envisaged. Second, the paper extends the welfare immigrant literature by documenting both the aggregated and individual-level changes in migration behaviours caused by a place-based welfare scheme. Most previous research provides merely individual-level evidence or aggregate-level evidence. Another contribution of this paper is the new county-level dataset cleaned and digitised from various statistical yearbooks and details of the NCMS county-level implementation from the newspapers and government announcements.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides background on different types of health insurance, in particular the NCMS, and rural-to-urban migrants in China. Section 3 mainly focuses on the county-level results, and Section 4 discusses the individual-level evidence. Policy implications and conclusions are in Section 5.",Locked out?

Our findings indicate a major role for occupation-specific technological changes.,"There have been substantial changes in the structure of employment over recent decades in most developed countries. Most economies are undergoing structural change, whereby labor reallocates across sectors, while at the occupational level labor markets have been polarizing, with employment shifting out of middle-earning routine jobs to low-earning manual and high-earning abstract jobs. There is a wide consensus in the literature that one of the main drivers of each of these patterns separately is biased technological change. Technological change biased across sectors is a key mechanism for structural change, technological change biased across production factors (occupations/tasks) is a prominent explanation for job polarization.==== The benefits of such non-neutral technological progress are not equally distributed, with some workers displaced or their skills becoming less valuable in the labor market. These distributional impacts have generated an interest in policies to counteract the adverse effects of technological change. To devise and implement such policies, the biases of technological change and their implications for the labor market needs to be understood.====Fig. 1 shows that the evolution of sectoral and of occupational employment shares are closely connected. Virtually all of the decline in the goods-producing sector’s employment share is due to a decline in routine employment in this sector. Conversely, most of the increase in high-skilled service employment is a rise in employment in abstract occupations in that sector.==== Because of this tight connection between employment reallocations across sectors and across occupations, models that do well in matching sectoral outcomes do also quite well in replicating certain aspects of occupational outcomes, and vice versa. However, this also poses a challenge for establishing what the true drivers of these phenomena are; is it technological change biased across industrial sectors or across tasks/occupations? Sector-specific technological change can reflect, for example, product innovations, and occupation-specific technological change can capture innovations in processes, i.e. in how tasks are completed. We believe that the technology used by workers depends on both their sector and their occupation. Hence we allow for technologies to evolve at the sector-and-occupation level.==== Next we identify patterns common to sectors and to occupations. With this at hand we can study which type of technological biases are responsible for the observed changes in market outcomes. We view our model as an important and useful first step towards evaluating policies responding to the rapid changes in the labor market.====In this paper we shed light on the types of technological change that drive the observed changes in (labor) market outcomes, without imposing any restrictions a priori on how technological change is biased. Specifically, we take a simplified version of the model in our previous work, Bárány and Siegel (2020), and use the same methodology as there to identify technologies. As in that paper, we decompose the changes in these technologies into occupation- and sector-specific components using a factor model. The novelty of this paper is that we study the contribution of these components to labor market outcomes. To do this, we specify a general equilibrium model, where individuals’ occupational choice and the demand for sectoral output responds endogenously to changing technologies. We use this general equilibrium model to quantify the role of the various components via counterfactual simulations in the re-allocation of employment across sectors and occupations, as well as in the evolution of occupational wages and of sectoral prices.====We assume a CES production function in manual, routine, and abstract labor in each sector. This is a simplified version of the sectoral production function we use in Bárány and Siegel (2020). As in that paper, we draw on key equations of the production side of the model together with data from the US Census and from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis between 1960 and 2017 to extract sector-and-occupation specific technologies. We decompose the changes in the inferred sector-occupation cell technologies using a factor model into neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components.==== We find that these components jointly explain around 90 percent of the variation in cell technology growth. We then construct the following counterfactual cell technology series: a sector-only path where technology is allowed to be biased only across sectors, an occupation-only path allowing for a bias only across occupations, and a neutral technology path that shuts down all biases of technological change. This approach is more rigorous than calibrating sector- and occupation-specific growth rates, as those would depend on the normalizations implemented.====The goal of this paper is to evaluate the role of neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components of technological change in labor market outcomes. In order to conduct counterfactual exercises we specify a general equilibrium model. We assume that a representative household chooses sectoral consumption in order to maximize a non-homothetic CES utility and that individuals optimally choose their occupation subject to idiosyncratic entry costs. We feed the counterfactual technology paths into the model to determine how important each component of technological change is in explaining various outcomes of interest. We find that qualitatively all counterfactual technology series generate employment and wage paths in line with the data. Quantitatively however, the occupation-specific component is needed to get close to the data. To explain the evolution of sectoral prices, all components are needed. For occupational income shares within sectors and employment shares at the cell level, the neutral and the sector-specific component have almost no effect, whereas the technology component idiosyncratic to the sector-occupation cell has a significant role.====There are many papers on the impact of technological change biased across tasks (occupations) or across sectors, but there is no consensus in the literature about the true nature of technological biases, potentially due to the trends shown in Fig. 1. In Bárány and Siegel (2018) we show that differences in productivity growth across sectors lead to polarization of wages and employment at the sectoral level, which in turn imply polarization in occupational outcomes because of differences in occupation intensities across sectors. Goos et al. (2014) argue conversely that differences in productivity growth across occupations together with differences in occupation intensity across sectors can lead to employment reallocation across sectors. In a similar vein, Duernecker and Herrendorf (2016), Lee and Shin (2017) and Aum et al. (2018) show that differences in occupational productivity growth can generate both structural transformation and changes in occupational employment consistent with the data.==== In contrast, we take a fully flexible approach to technological change, where it is sector-and-occupation specific. This is what allows us to evaluate the role of sector- and occupation-biases in technological change on an equal footing. An overarching conclusion of our analysis is that occupation-biases in technological change are quantitatively more important. One implication of this finding is that if one wants to introduce biases in technological change into models, the most important bias to introduce is across occupations. Another implication is that policies targeting workers’ occupational choice might be better at improving labor market outcomes than industrial policies.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 presents the data and the model parameterization. In Section 4 we first identify neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components of technological change, and then analyze the role that each of these components play in our general equilibrium model.

We present a model in which workers acquire knowledge on the job and firms pursue a policy of learning-by-hiring. The latter generates workers flows that connect firms in a network. A firm's position in the network depends on its capacity to absorb the tacit knowledge developed by other firms in the economy. The model predicts that firms central to the network, those with the highest absorptive capacity of tacit knowledge, have the highest wage dispersion. Using 1995-2001 Veneto (a region of Italy) matched employer-employee data, we map workers flows between firms and build the network formed by all the firms. For each firm, we assess its network centrality. In our data conditional within-firm wage dispersion turns out to be increasing in network centrality, confirming the prediction of the model.","Firms are heterogeneous in the distributions of the wages they offer and they compete to hire workers. In the same labour market, we observe variations in average wages and wage dispersion across firms. Such heterogeneity is accounted for only partially by the human capital composition of a firm's workforce. The conditional (on a worker's observable characteristics) component of average wages and within-firm wage dispersion has been extensively investigated empirically as well as theoretically. Market imperfections are called upon to explain it. Search frictions account for the wage dispersion across workers, meaning that otherwise identical workers receive different wages in identical firms (e.g. Mortensen, 1990; Burdett and Mortensen, 1998). Job mobility, inter-firm competition, and human capital accumulation all generate heterogeneity in within-firm wage dispersion (Postel-Visnay and Robin, 2002; Burdett et al., 2011).====Theories of knowledge spillovers rely on inter-firm worker mobility as the mechanism facilitating the knowledge flows between firms (Song et al., 2003; Stoyanov and Zubanov, 2012; Parotta and Pozzoli, 2012; Serafinelli, 2019). In this study, we highlight knowledge transfer as specific channel through which labour mobility affects conditional within-firm wage dispersion and offer new empirical evidence consistent with this channel. Specifically, we present a model in which knowledge is an essential input of production and a by-product of production activity at the same time. Knowledge as a by-product of production activity is rarely codified. It takes the form of tacit knowledge: information and best-practices that workers acquire on the job and they can take to any new job within the firm or any new firm they join. It follows that firms hiring workers from other firms can access knowledge otherwise not available. This induces firms to pursue a strategy of learning-by-hiring. Moreover, combining tacit knowledge from a variety of sources, firms can improve their productivity (Vilalta-Bufi, 2010). This provides firms with an incentive to hire workers from a wide array of other firms.====However, firms have different abilities to take advantage of the tacit knowledge carried by workers trained by other firms. Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990) refer to the latter as a firm's absorptive capacity. We assume firms differ in the complexity of the tacit knowledge they produce and model absorptive capacity as their ability to use tacit knowledge of increasing complexity. The more complex is the knowledge a firm can digest, the greater is the number of firms from which it can hire workers. This in turn improves its absorptive capacity, as prior knowledge favours the assimilation of new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989, 1990). In brief, the adoption of learning-by-hiring policies generates worker flows that connect the firms in a network. Connecting to a greater number of other firms, those firms able to digest complex knowledge are central to the network and thus experience enhanced absorptive capacity. As long as workers carrying complex tacit knowledge command higher wages, firms central to the network also have the highest wage dispersion.====Using employer–employee matched data from a highly industrialized Italian region, we find a positive correlation between conditional within-firm wage dispersion and a firm's position in the network. Our data provide us with an individual worker's employment history and thus information about the worker flows connecting firms. To take advantage of the information in our data, we apply network theory. We map the worker flows between firms and build the network formed by these firms. For each firm, we then assess its network centrality, a measure based on the idea that a firm hiring workers from a greater number of firms obtains more knowledge and thus is located in a more central position than others. Acquiring more knowledge, the firm develops better absorptive capacity. Thus, the firm's position in the network is informative of its absorptive capacity. In our data, conditional within-firm wage dispersion turns out to be increasing in network centrality. That is, the more central is a firm in the network, the more absorptive capacity it develops and the greater is its conditional wage dispersion.====The contribution of our study to the literature is twofold. First, we contribute to the literature on wage dispersion, providing evidence of the conditional within-firm wage dispersion in a market at almost full employment and explaining it by the role played by workers as carriers of tacit knowledge. Second, we contribute to the literature on knowledge transfer, which usually identifies knowledge carriers by means of the wage premium firms pay to attract them (Parrotta and Pozzoli, 2012). We endogenize the wage premium and relate this to a firm's absorptive capacity, finding in the data a correlation between that and within-firm wage dispersion.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature. In Section 3, we present the model. In Section 4, we introduce the dataset and present the measure of network centrality.

This paper proposes to transform the original quantile regression model in order to ensure the conditional independence assumption to hold when it is rejected for the original model. Our empirical results on the gender wage gap for Germany suggest that unobserved selection may be underestimated if no transformation is applied.","Decomposition analyses beyond pure comparison of means have become increasingly popular in applied economic research (for an overview, see Fortin et al. (2011)). One particularly popular approach proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) and Melly (2005) uses conditional quantile regression to estimate marginal wage distributions for different counterfactual scenarios. Building on the control function approach of Buchinsky, 1998, Buchinsky, 2001, this technique was extended by Albrecht et al. (2009)to account for selection on unobservables. An important application of the Albrecht et al. (2009) method is the gender wage gap for which a number of authors have assessed the impact of female selection into the labor market (e.g., Albrecht et al., 2009, Chzhen and Mumford, 2011).====However, the use==== of this method has been called into question by Huber and Melly (2015) who pointed to the fact that Buchinsky’s (Buchinsky, 1998, Buchinsky, 2001) control function approach is only valid if regressors and error terms are independent conditional on selection probabilities. This rules out heterogenous slope coefficients, which are often the motivation for using quantile regression approaches. Based on this idea, Huber and Melly (2015) develop a test of the conditional independence assumption which should be carried out before applying Buchinsky (Buchinsky, 1998, Buchinsky, 2001) selection corrections. If the Huber and Melly (2015) test passes, then the results of an analysis as in Albrecht et al. (2009) can be trusted. If the test rejects, however, users of this method are in the uncomfortable position of applying a method whose assumptions are likely to be violated.====The aim of this paper is to propose a monotonic transformation of the original quantile regression model aimed at eliminating a violation of the conditional independence assumption.==== For this transformation, we draw on Chen and Khan (2003) who used a similar transformation for the analysis of a sample selection model for the mean in the presence of heteroscedasticity. Our approach can be seen as a way to eliminate conditional heteroscedasticity which results in heterogeneous slope coefficients. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that such a transformation may be successful in arriving at a model in which conditional independence holds and the Huber and Melly (2015) test passes. Our application of this approach to the gender wage gap in Germany provides a real data case in which the Huber/Melly test passes in the transformed model but rejects in the untransformed model.====This paper makes two contributions. First, we offer users of the Albrecht et al. (2009) method a way to circumvent the Huber and Melly (2015) critique. Second, we present new results on the gender wage gap in Germany taking into account selection on unobservables. As Albrecht et al. (2009) for the Netherlands and Chzhen and Mumford, 2011 for the UK, we find positive selection on unobservables leading to an underestimation of the gender gap. Our results also suggest that this underestimation may be more pronounced compared to using an untransformed model that is susceptible to the Huber and Melly (2015) critique.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 describes the data used in our empirical analysis, which were taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel. In Section 4, we propose the transformation aimed at eliminating violations from conditional independence. Section 5 presents our empirical findings.

Employers can exploit referrer-worker ","Employee referrals are a common source of recruitment – employees within a firm recommend workers for a job in the firm. Indeed, 50% of workers report having obtained their jobs via referral by a friend or family member (Topa, 2011). Many firms have started formal employee referral programmes (ERP).==== LinkedIn now provides a tool to improve these ERPs for firms. But why does such referral based recruitment take place in preference to anonymous advertisement based search?====The literature has differentiated between four ways in which employee referrals can help employers: (1) Reducing the cost of search; (2) Screening for productive employees (e.g. Beaman and Magruder (2012); Fafchamps and Moradi (2015); Montgomery (1991)); (3) Improving match quality (e.g. Burks et al. (2015); Simon and Warner (1992)); (4) Reducing moral hazard on the job (e.g. Dhillon et al. (2019); Heath (2018); Kugler (2003)). While reason (1) may not necessarily lead to hiring more productive employees, theoretically at least, reasons (2)–(4) imply that referred workers will be more productive. Empirically, however, the literature is still divided on whether (a) referred workers are more productive and (b) what is the channel by which this happens if so.==== Among some important factors, the type of job (e.g. ability vs. effort, the employer ’s cost from worker opportunism) and incentives of the referring employee (see e.g. Dhillon et al. (2019)) seem to be driving a lot of the differences in results.====We contribute to this literature by using a laboratory experiment to show that worker moral hazard can be mitigated by referrals (reason (4)) in a setting of jobs which pay low fixed wages, where the costs of providing financial incentives are too high, and workers cannot be disciplined by the threat of firing. Among the various channels for mitigating moral hazard discussed in the literature – better monitoring of workers who are referred (Kugler, 2003) or referrers acting as guarantors for their referred worker (Heath, 2018) – we focus on social preferences of the worker towards the referrer as in Dhillon et al. (2019). We build on the key ideas in Dhillon et al. (2019)) that the social proximity of the worker towards her referrer helps to solve worker moral hazard problems facing the employer. We design an experiment that is specifically designed to measure the effect of social proximity between referred worker and referring worker on effort provision while using the framing of the workplace. In our controlled setting, we can rule out other reasons for employers to choose referral than worker moral hazard.====The key feature in our experiment is that the referring (referred) worker does not know (by name) ==== is being referred (referring) but does know whether they are (real) friends on Facebook and also knows the number of common friends. This rules out any possibility of screening for productivity as the referring worker does not see the person he is referring. Assuming that the group of friends is large enough, as is the case with undergraduate students in general, it would be difficult to infer which friend is being referred.==== In observational studies, to the contrary, it is harder to sift screening from moral hazard – any task involves some dimension of ability or intrinsic motivation/reliability that referrers may screen on.==== Our experimental design rules out other possible reasons for referrals – e.g. screening as discussed above, match quality – we do not allow communication between referrers and potential workers or reducing the cost of search – the employer is presented with a choice between two workers or the use of an employee to hire a worker. Moreover, in observational studies, only the productivity of workers who are hired is observed, so if employers incorporate the (unobserved) information on workers contained in referrals, they may have higher standards for hiring non-referred workers. This may imply that there is no significant difference in the productivity of referred vs. non-referred workers in the firm. In our experimental setting, first workers in the spot market are chosen randomly, and second, there is no hidden information on productivity of workers available to referrers, due to the anonymous design.====According to our theoretical framework, referrals reduce worker moral hazard through ‘directed’ altruism’ (Leider et al., 2009). Referred workers will expend more effort when a friend refers them, and when the friend stands to lose if the worker does not perform, relative to being hired anonymously or relative to a referral from a stranger. Our experiment tests whether directed altruism can explain higher effort in a workplace framing.====Our main results are that referrals can significantly reduce moral hazard. Our setting captures certain types of jobs, such as low skill jobs at minimum wages, mostly done by temporary migrant labour where the threat of firing is not sufficient to induce the worker to work hard as in garment factories in developing countries====, or jobs where ability is easily tested but the wages required to prevent opportunistic behaviour would be prohibitively high due to problems of contract enforcement or limited liability as in the case of diamond merchants.==== In such situations it is well known that social networks can take on the task of informal contract enforcement (Chandrasekhar et al., 2018). However, when the worker has directed altruism towards the referrer, then the employer can exploit these social preferences to induce worker effort. The employer designs a contract which conditions referrer rewards/punishments to the referrer on worker effort. Such a contract is cheaper for the employer (but worse for the referrer) when the worker is highly altruistic towards the referrer, as in that case, the employer needs to commit to pay less in monetary terms to the referrer. The twist is that the referrer has private information on the degree of social proximity of the worker. The referrer will therefore have incentives to choose a worker who has lower social proximity. However, when the referrer has a high degree of altruism towards the worker, the non-monetary incentives to hire a socially proximate worker dominate any monetary incentives and incentives are aligned with the employer. Under these conditions, referrers will choose socially proximate workers and such workers will put in higher effort. Our experiment therefore validates the observational studies on the use of referrals to curb moral hazard, and contributes by showing a specific mechanism, i.e. social proximity of workers towards referrers.====There are several novel features of our experimental design. First, we use the social relationships between participants as they are in real-life, thereby incorporating a feature that is typical to field experiments.==== Our experiment can be considered in between a conventional lab experiment and a framed field experiment as it incorporates field context information with a standard subject pool of students (see Harrison and List (2004)). Second, the use of Facebook information allows us to separate out the effects of knowing other things about the worker than just the social proximity: referrers cannot distinguish between two workers except on the basis of social proximity. This together with the fact that the task of returning money does not require much by way of ability rules out the role of other characteristics like ability of the worker. Finally, we have one-shot anonymous interactions between players, ruling out repeat interactions rather than social preferences as a possible channel for higher returns to referrers relative to the spot market.",Hiring an employee’s friends is good for business: Overcoming moral hazard with social networks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301329,24 September 2020,2020,Research Article,244.0

We further find that returns to non-cognitive skills differ between developing and developed countries.","Non-cognitive skills, such as personality traits and preferences, play an important role in occupational outcomes.==== While existing studies mainly focus on western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations,==== evidence from non-“WEIRD” populations is lacking. Labour markets in emerging and developing countries differ substantially from labour markets in industrialised countries. They are characterised as labour intensive, credit constrained, and prone to greater earnings instability and misallocation of labour in the agricultural sector (Banerjee, Duflo, 2007, Campbell, 2011, Campbell, Ahmed, 2012, Gollin, Lagakos, Waugh, 2014). It is therefore unclear how far the results from existing studies hold for non-“WEIRD” populations. Since job creation has been identified as the key to alleviating extreme poverty and improving living standards (Van Trotsenburg, 2018), it is vital to understand individual labour market decisions and productivity determinants in these countries.====Until now, only a few studies on non-cognitive skills have utilised data from developing regions. For instance, Laajaj and Macours (2017) suggest that the selection of higher skilled individuals into non-agricultural jobs could lead to lower agricultural productivity and technology adoption. Glewwe et al. (2017) stress the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills as key determinants of whether children remain in school longer. Using data from rural India, Helmers and Patnam (2011) show that cognitive and non-cognitive skills are self- and cross-productive. Both Gertler et al. (2014) and Attanasio et al. (2015) use experiments to find that early childhood interventions focused on non-cognitive skills can lead to higher labour market earnings and increased parental investments. Increased parental education, especially that of the mother, also aids the development of non-cognitive skills of their children (Leight and Liu, 2016). Furthermore, even though non-farming households tend to be better off than farming-only households (Sharma, Nguyen, Grote, Nguyen, 2016, Sohns, Revilla Diez, 2016), a majority of households in developing countries rely on income from agriculture and environmental resource extraction (Parvathi and Nguyen, 2018). Since the skill set and the labour market opportunities in these settings are rather homogeneous, non-cognitive skills might explain why some individuals pursue a career other than farming and earn higher wages than those of their counterparts engaged in similar occupations. Heckman et al. (2006) find that non-cognitive skills are particularly important for those with lower levels of education. This argument is supported by Laajaj et al. (2019), who hypothesise that non-cognitive skills are even more important than cognitive skills for labour market outcomes in developing countries.====Against this backdrop, we shed light on the relationship between non-cognitive skills and occupational outcomes using a sample of rural households in two emerging economies. In particular, we first analyse the role of non-cognitive skills in occupational attainment; second, we examine how non-cognitive skills affect earnings within different occupation types, since identical skills can be valued differently across occupations. In this regard, we follow the argumentation of John and Thomsen (2014), who study the relationship between personality traits and occupational attainment and earnings for a sample in Germany. Additionally, we test whether the effects of non-cognitive skills are homogeneous across the earnings distribution. Finally, we compare our results with those of existing studies of industrialised countries. Since labour market characteristics differ between developed and developing countries, we expect at least some variation.====Our study contributes to the literature in four ways. First, we provide insights into the relationship between non-cognitive skills and occupational attainment as well as earnings for individuals in rural Southeast Asia. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so using a comprehensive range of measures for rural Thailand and Vietnam. Second, we complement existing studies from industrialised populations by providing evidence for occupations that are specifically important in rural labour markets, such as farming or small-scale businesses. Third, we advance the proposition put forth by Laajaj et al. (2019) that the role of non-cognitive skills is context-specific. Last, our research adds to recent studies using developing country data suggesting that not only cognitive but also non-cognitive skills entail earning differentials. Therefore, we highlight the importance of building and supporting structures for the development of non-cognitive skills.====We use a data set for Thailand and Vietnam collected under the Thailand Vietnam Socio Economic Panel (TVSEP) in 2017. The survey provides information on approximately 4,000 individuals. A section on the measurement of non-cognitive skills was included for the first time in 2017. We can therefore include a range of nine measures that capture an individual’s non-cognitive skills: the Big Five model consisting of the factors openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism as well as locus of control, risk, trust and patience. The Big Five model and the locus of control thereby capture personality traits, while risk, trust and patience are considered preferences (Falk et al., 2018). In addition to our measures on personality and preferences, we categorise individual occupations based on the International Classification of Occupation (ISCO-08) from the International Labour Organization. These occupations are used in our analysis to examine the impact of personality on occupational outcomes. We further add a host of control variables to the analysis and perform a series of robustness checks.====Our results suggest that non-cognitive skills are important predictors of both the occupational attainment and earnings of individuals in our rural sample. In particular, conscientiousness is the most decisive factor for occupational attainment, which is in line with the literature utilising developed country data sets (e.g., Barrick, Mount, 1991, John, Thomsen, 2014). Specifically, higher levels of conscientiousness are associated with a higher likelihood of pursuing a job outside of farming. For example, a one standard deviation increase in conscientiousness raises the probability of being self-employed by 1.46 percentage points while it decreases the likelihood of being a commercial farmer by 2.73 percentage points. With respect to individual earnings, we find that neuroticism is a key determinant, which is in line with a recent study by Laajaj et al. (2019). This differs from findings in WEIRD populations, where conscientiousness and locus of control have been found to be predictors of individual earnings (Mueller, Plug, 2006, Nyhus, Pons, 2005, Stuetzer, Audretsch, Obschonka, Gosling, Rentfrow, Potter, 2018). Individuals who score one standard deviation higher than the average in neuroticism earn at least 46% (Government Worker) less compared to the average in their occupation group. Amongst preferences, trust is an important determinant of individual earnings for most occupation types. In addition, we observe a decreasing effect of non-cognitive skills across the earnings distribution, which broadly aligns with findings from Eren and Ozbeklik (2013) and Nandi and Nicoletti (2014).====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides the theoretical framework for our paper as well as a review of the important literature.

We measure the overall welfare effect by examining their labor market activities, family formation, and household ","We use data from the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), an annual ==== of a representative sample of South Korean households (and individuals therein) in urban areas. Pooling the first 20 waves of the KLIPS spanning the period from 1998 to 2017, we construct our analysis sample of men and women who graduated from college between 1989 and 2010. We analyze a comprehensive set of outcomes regarding work, family, household finances, and living arrangements. By tracking the crisis cohorts and their luckier counterparts up to their mid-40s, we can focus on longer-term outcomes beyond early career status. In particular, as more than 20 years have lapsed since the Asian financial crisis, we can distinguish permanent changes from temporary adjustments in marriage, fertility, and asset building.====Our results show that adverse ==== at graduation have far-reaching consequences beyond the labor market dimension. In addition, the effects of a recession are heterogeneous by gender, because men and women face different choice sets and constraints when making decisions related to work, family, and household finances. We find that male recession cohorts experience a large and persistent reduction in employment and earnings for up to 12 years after graduation. A 1 percentage point higher unemployment rate at graduation results in a 1.9% lower employment probability and 2.5% lower earnings during the first 10 years of potential experience. This deterioration in career outcomes leads to a permanent decline in the marriage and childbearing rates. While consumption is insulated from reduced earnings, men who graduate during a recession hold lower levels of financial assets, are less likely to be homeowners, and are more likely to live with parents.====For women, the recession penalty in the labor market is more subtle than that for men, because even those graduating in a good economy have weak labor force attachment owing to family considerations. Female recession cohorts suffer from sizable reductions in employment and earnings immediately after graduation, but the negative recession effect disappears within 2 years. The limited job opportunities in their early career lead to accelerated childbirth and higher fertility. While there is a delay in financial asset building, it is not as substantial as that of their male counterparts. As a coping mechanism, female recession cohorts tend to find a spouse from a more advantaged economic background, as opposed to remaining unmarried or living with parents.====This study is related to three strands of literature. First, a large body of literature seeks to identify labor market penalties for young workers who graduate in adverse economic conditions (e.g., ====, ====).==== The consequences of such adverse conditions are known as the “scarring effect,” owing to the long-lasting damage on the careers of affected individuals. We add to the literature on scarring effects by showing that a large-scale recession leads to a substantially large and persistent reduction in employment probability especially among male college graduates. ==== and ==== also observe a large decline in employment among college graduates affected by the Great Recession. However, the extensive margin effect on earnings is mostly absent from high-skilled labor in other studies, which focus on more modest variations in regular business cycles. In addition, this study is one of very few works that analyzes men and women separately. We show that the effect of initial labor market conditions on career outcomes lasts much longer for men than that for women, in line with ==== and ====.====Second, we add to a small but growing literature on the long-term effects of initial labor market conditions on family formation. Prior results are mixed in terms of the sign and magnitude of the effect (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Our study contributes to the literature by showing that reduced labor market opportunities early in a career can lead to a permanent change in marriage probability and fertility, especially in the case of a large-scale recession. Furthermore, we find that labor market entry conditions may affect women’s choice of spouse. This result fills a gap in the literature, where previous studies have noted a sizable response in fertility, despite the short-lived reduction in own earnings among female recession cohorts (====, ====, ====).====Lastly, our results on the financial outcomes of scarred cohorts are closely related to ====, the only existing study, to our knowledge, on the effects of labor market entry conditions on asset holdings and living arrangements.==== ==== suggest that migration of recession graduates to areas with low cost-of-living limits the effect of initial labor market conditions on family net worth. We show that recession graduates’ asset accumulation is substantially delayed in our case, in which such a migration pattern is absent. Our result complements evidence in the unemployment insurance and the development literature that asset holdings buffer consumption decline when a negative income shock occurs (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). In addition, we provide evidence that recession cohorts also rely on parents or spouses to protect their living conditions against the initial negative shock.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== presents an overview of the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis and its impacts on the South Korean economy. ==== describes the KLIPS data and the analysis sample. ==== explains the empirical strategy used to measure the recession effects and examines the internal validity of the identification assumption. ==== presents the estimation results on labor market, family, and financial outcomes. ==== discusses the mechanisms and implications of our findings. ==== concludes.",The long-term effects of labor market entry in a recession: Evidence from the Asian financial crisis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301305,23 September 2020,2020,Research Article,246.0

Absent from previous work is an analysis of how such a policy alters incentives to plan for expected income shocks, a central question in other social insurance contexts. A conceptual framework demonstrates the potential for PFL to increase or decrease household saving depending on labor supply flexibility assumptions. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation, I present evidence that the introduction of PFL in California reduced the savings of expectant parents relative to different comparison groups. Imprecise heterogeneity analysis suggests the crowd out is concentrated in higher-income families.","Paid family leave (PFL), the program by which parents receive paid time off from work to care for a new child, has been suggested as a policy tool for addressing numerous areas of concern, including low fertility rates, intergenerational mobility, gender pay disparities, and various health opportunities. Although the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying parents, the United States does not have a federal paid leave program. The existing research on parental leave policies, paid and unpaid, can be organized into two areas. First, these policies have been shown to affect leave lengths and labor market outcomes of mothers. The result that parental leave expansions lead to mothers taking more time off from work after giving birth may be unsurprising (Han, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2009, Lalive, Schlosser, Steinhauer, iZweimüller, 2014, Ruhm, 1998, Waldfogel, 1999), but there is also evidence that such policies can increase the labor force attachment and wage growth of mothers (Baum, Ruhm, 2016, Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2013). The second area of research has focused on child outcomes where there is some consensus that parental leave improves short run health outcomes (Rossin, 2011, Ruhm, 2000, Sayour, 2018, Stearns, 2015, Tanaka, 2005), but mixed evidence on longer run outcomes such as education and wages (Baker, Milligan, 2010, Baker, Milligan, 2015, Carneiro, Løken, Salvanes, 2015, Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, Salvanes, 2016, Danzer, Lavy, 2017, Dustmann, Schönberg, 2012, Rasmussen, 2010).==== Despite this growing literature on parental leave, an important question appears to have been overlooked: how does the wage replacement benefit of PFL affect household savings? If a family alters their private assets in response to PFL, then the size of the benefit transfer does not represent the total change in resources available to the family during the newborn period. Understanding the size and direction of this response is crucial for evaluating the full impact of PFL and how it compares to other family-friendly policy options.====There are multiple economic arguments that are typically made for mandating PFL, many of which relate to potential market failures. First, private employers or insurers may not offer wage insurance due to adverse selection, although paid parental leave by private employers has doubled over the last decade (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) and restrictions such as exclusion periods have made private temporary disability insurance (TDI) markets feasible. Second, wage replacement during leave may be welfare-enhancing if families are liquidity constrained and cannot adequately smooth consumption, thereby affecting their decision of how much time to take off from work. In addition to concerns over a recovering mother’s health, prematurely returning to work limits the potential benefits of more consistent breastfeeding (Huang and Yang, 2015) and bonding time during the newborn period. The critical first few months of child development, which can impose long run externalities on society, combined with worries of individual optimization failures (e.g., myopic or misinformed parents) provide additional motivation for programs such as PFL. As is always the case, the economic arguments for mandating PFL, or unpaid leave for that matter, rest on a set of assumptions that may be more or less accurate depending on the family, cultural norms, and surrounding institutions.====Economists have long been interested in how social insurance programs alter incentives to privately save. The welfare gains from risk-pooling may be limited if participants respond by reducing their private actions to avoid, mitigate, or weather adverse events. Understanding how PFL can affect household savings is partially dependent on what type of saving motive dominates. Life-cycle models of saving focus on anticipated changes in earnings and expenses, the impact of social security on private savings serving as the prime policy example. (Browning, Crossley, 2001, Feldstein, 1974, Feldstein, 1977). The life-cycle model predicts that parents plan for reduced earnings after the birth of a child and save accordingly.==== Fertility, like consumption and earnings, has a general pattern which makes some degree of planning possible. Precautionary saving, on the other hand, is motivated by uncertainty in future earnings or expenses (Leland, 1968, Sandmo, 1970), arguably making this “buffer stock” of savings more important for liquidity constrained households (Carroll, 1997, Deaton, 1991).==== Where life-cycle saving is intended to navigate changes that occur with some degree of certainty, precautionary saving is intended to weather a low-probability, unpredictable event. The precautionary motive may be relevant because, despite modern birth control methods, nearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended.==== Even so, unique aspects of pregnancy set it apart from other shocks often covered by social insurance programs, including job loss and even other health-related shocks.==== It is therefore plausible that the precautionary savings response to the reduction in income-uncertainty provided by PFL would be small and negative.==== The life-cycle response to PFL, outlined in Section 3, is less clear. PFL may crowd out private savings but it may also lead to increased savings due to parents planning for longer leave periods. Furthermore, the life-cycle and precautionary motives can co-exist simultaneously (Hubbard et al., 1995), making the net effect of PFL on savings a function of the relative importance of each motive.====This paper uses a quasi-experimental research design to measure the impact of California’s PFL program (CA-PFL) on household savings. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) collects information on household financial assets held before giving birth, making it possible to estimate the impact of CA-PFL by comparing expectant mothers’ savings across time and states. Additional analysis uses mothers with slightly older children as a comparison group in order to net out California-specific changes which may coincide with the introduction of CA-PFL. The results consistently indicate that CA-PFL reduced savings held before giving birth, though the magnitude of the response is sensitive to specification choice. The sign of the response combined with evidence that CA-PFL induced longer leave periods implies that the crowd out effect is the dominant component of the life-cycle response. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that an extra dollar of PFL benefits increases available household resources by less than $0.50. Yet even with substantial savings crowd out and a balanced-budget requirement, the net welfare impact of PFL could be positive. There are multiple arguments for PFL and, by focusing on savings, this paper only explores the consumption smoothing argument. The heterogeneity analysis presented in this paper has limited precision due to the small sample size but suggests that the negative response was concentrated in higher-income families. This pattern may be useful for guiding future research related to optimal parental leave policy design, namely the trade-offs between universal and targeted coverage. A key takeaway of this paper is that the unintended consequences present in other social insurance settings should not be overlooked when evaluating PFL.",The impact of paid family leave on household savings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301251,18 September 2020,2020,Research Article,247.0

The conclusion is one that though widely believed has proven challenging to establish empirically. By doing so, the paper makes two contributions, one conceptual and one statistical. First, it more closely aligns with the understanding of racial profiling as signifying that black individuals experience more frequent interaction with the police. While disproportional susceptibility to vehicle searches also exemplifies profiling, being pulled over is a much more common margin for potential profiling, which this paper models a tractable way of identifying. Second, studies of secondary decisions such as searches frequently assume that there is no bias in the initial stop decision. An analysis of traffic stops across eight states questions this assumption, concluding that stopped drivers constitute a selected sample. Although bias is theoretically continuous, average behavior actually fits well into two distinct groups, with 30–40% of officers in the group that exhibits a relatively high propensity to stop black drivers. The implication is that race-based policing is more prevalent than the “rotten apples” theory might suggest.","Philando Castile was stopped by police at least 46 times in 14 years. He paid a heavy economic cost of thousands of dollars in fines and auto repairs, hours spent in court, reduced opportunity from having his driver’s license suspended, and higher insurance costs that may explain why he lost his insurance, which led to additional stops and citations. During yet another routine traffic stop he was killed by an officer who mistakenly thought Castile was reaching for a gun (Peralta and Corley, 2016).====Castile’s prior pattern of stops for common offenses such as “impeding traffic,” “not wearing a seat belt,” “failure to slow down,” and “running a stop sign” invites two main conjectures: 1) almost everyone on the road is committing some form of minor infraction for which an officer ==== pull them over, and 2) when someone is repeatedly stopped for minor infractions, the real reason may be something other than what is written on his traffic tickets. The question of interest here is whether that reason is his race. Are drivers like Castile profiled by the police? Does “drivers like Castile” mean “drivers of color?” If so, how can we detect “profiling,” and whom do we mean by “the police?”====These are the questions this paper addresses. It builds on a growing literature that examines how to detect race-based differences in policing and how to assess the degree of heterogeneity in that regard across individual officers. The first direction in which it advances the literature is with respect to the margin of interest. Instead of focusing on a rare secondary decision within an encounter, such as vehicle searches or use of force, the paper considers the primary decision to initiate a traffic stop. Consideration of this primary decision is important because it more closely aligns with the general understanding of racial profiling whereby African-Americans experience more frequent interactions with the police. Examining the decision to initiate a traffic stop is also important for a statistical reason: studies of secondary decisions typically take the set of stopped drivers to be random as far as race is concerned. If instead that is a selected sample, as this paper demonstrates, then such assumptions might be called into question.====To circumvent the “denominator” problem that one cannot observe which drivers each officer could potentially choose to stop, the paper combines a behavioral theoretical model with a latent class estimation approach to tractably identify heterogeneity among officers. The model compares officers working in the same geographic area and time period to group them based on how frequently they stop black drivers relative to white drivers. Although the theoretical concept of bias ranges across a spectrum, it turns out that average officer behavior is actually explained well by dividing officers into two discrete groups. Across the eight states analyzed, the model consistently estimates that 30–40% of officers fall into the “high frequency” group, which given certain assumptions can be interpreted as the share who exhibit racial bias. Such an interpretation implies that race-influenced policing is fairly prevalent, in contrast with the “rotten apples” theory that attributes the preponderance of such behavior to a small number of outliers.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 places the current work within the context of the literature. It first reviews the aforementioned denominator problem and methods the racial profiling literature has developed for addressing it. It then details related work that analyzes decision making at the individual officer level. Section 3 develops the theoretical model for officer decision making that motivates the empirical analysis and provides a framework for interpretation of the results. Section 4 details the finite mixture model used to conduct the estimation. Section 5 describes the traffic stop data used in the estimation and presents an empirical descriptive overview. Section 6 discusses the main estimation results. Section 7 demonstrates the robustness of those results to the various modeling assumptions made. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper and considers the practical implications of the findings.",Officer differences in traffic stops of minority drivers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301160,18 September 2020,2020,Research Article,248.0

To estimate the causal effect, I exploit an exogenous source of variation in the birth interval led by a Chinese regulation that forced a long interval as a curb on fertility. It is shown that an increase in the birth interval leads to an improvement in the first childs height-for-age score and a decrease in the probability of the first child suffering a stunt in growth. ==== results indicate a larger effect in the lower end of the height distribution. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that girls, especially those with younger brothers, benefit more from long birth intervals, implying that resource dilution is a key mechanism producing this heterogeneity in the estimated effects.","The relationship between family structure and child outcomes has been widely discussed in the literature. For example, beginning with Becker and Lewis (1973), there has been a rich body of literature examining the quantity-quality trade-off, with many empirical studies finding a negative correlation between family size and child outcomes (such as Cáceres-Delpiano (2006); Downey (1995); Hanushek (1992) in developed countries, Li et al. (2008); Patrinos and Psacharopoulos (1997); Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009) in developing countries) but some suggesting negligible or even positive effects (Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005, Millimet, Wang, 2011). Another widely discussed topic is the effect of birth order, with studies uniformly finding a negative effect on the older children (Behrman, Taubman, 1986, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005, Booth, Kee, 2009), and a third topic of interest is the role of sibship gender composition that has generated mixed results (Butcher, Case, 1994, Conley, 2000, Hauser, Kuo, 1998).====Compared with other aspects of family structure mentioned above, birth interval has received much less attention but may play an important role in child outcomes as well, with Steelman et al. (2002) noting that ”the effects [of sex composition] are smaller than those of sibship size or spacing, at least in the United States” and Wineberg and McCarthy (1989) stating that ”the timing of births may well be the most important aspect of fertility differentials”. The relevance of the birth interval is likely to grow, with the timing of births becoming a more important aspect of family choice as the fertility rate continues to decline in most parts of the world====Subsequent birth interval, in contrast to preceding birth interval, denotes the age difference between the individual of interest and the next younger sibling. With a focus on the older sibling in a pair, researchers have discussed potential mechanisms from three different perspectives. First, from the physiological perspective, numerous studies indicate that short intervals harm the first child due to a higher probability of early weaning (Bohler, Bergstrom, 1996, Retherford, Choe, Thapa, Gubhaju, 1993) or increased exposure, higher transmission risk or growing severeness of infectious diseases (Aaby, Bukh, Maria Lisse, Smits, 1983, Swenson, 1978). Second, from the psychological perspective, there is evidence that in a widely spaced pair of siblings, the older sibling tends to provide more caregiving and teaching to the younger one (Cicirelli, 1973), which potentially could result in both positive and negative effects on the elder child====Third, the economic perspective also suggests that a child’s development may be affected by subsequent birth interval. In particular, there are two major economic channels for this relationship: resource dilution and scale effect. The resource dilution hypothesis (Blake, 1989) is based on the notion that a household dispenses valuable resources such as goods and parental time to all the children in the household. A longer birth interval implies that the older child benefits from a longer time living in a smaller-sized family in early childhood, and so this hypothesis indicates a positive effect on the older sibling of a longer subsequent birth interval. This hypothesis, though seldom tested empirically (Buckles and Munnich (2012) is an exception), has found support in the literature on family size (see Steelman et al. (2002) for a review). In contrast, the second potential economic channel, the scale effect, which is the change in per child cost as family size changes, predicts the opposite relationship. According to the scale effect, a household benefits from having children closer together because it decreases the per child cost in several ways. Similarly aged children may share toys and clothes, and parents with closely spaced children may also be able to focus their time at home, thus reducing interruptions to their supply of labor in the workplace and allowing them to grow their household economic resources more rapidly.(Steelman et al., 2002) The scale effect thus suggests that the shorter the interval, the better the outcome for both children. In sum, taking the two potential economic channels into considertion, the effects of a longer subsequent birth interval are ambiguous.====Within the limited literature on birth interval, many studies focus on the ==== birth interval, the effect on the younger sibling, due to the physiological concern about a pregnancy too close to the one before. This literature tends to focus on short intervals (less than 24 months) and early outcomes such as neonatal and infant mortality. Among the relatively few studies on the causal effect of subsequent birth interval, most look at educational outcomes, finding evidence of a positive effect of long subsequent interval (Buckles, Munnich, 2012, Karwath, Relikowski, Schmitt, 2014, Pettersson-Lidbom, Thoursie). As studies on family size and birth order have shown, however, scale and even the existence of effects can be sensitive to the child outcome indicators. Hence, it is important to investigate other aspects of children development such as physical growth and nutrition status. Finally, while some physiologists have discussed the relationship between birth interval and the anthropometric outcomes of older siblings, there is no attention to exogenous sources of variation and so the conclusions are based on correlation, not causality. Moreover, the results are mixed and inconclusive,==== so additional evidence to understand how the subsequent birth interval causally affects child outcomes is clearly needed.====This paper begins with a theoretical discussion of how the subsequent birth interval affects the first child’s access to resources and thus nutrition status in economic terms. As for the direction of the total effect of the birth interval, a theoretical analysis predicts that resource dilution and scale effect give converse predictions. It is further proposed that a longer interval benefits first children who are worse off and who are less preferred by parents more as long as the resource dilution hypothesis is true.====It then turns to the empirical analysis. A main challenge to obtaining the causal effect comes from the potential endogeneity of the birth interval length, and an important source of endogeneity is unobserved parental characteristics that are related to both interval length and child outcomes. For instance, parents with strong concerns about child outcomes might consider family planning more and decide to have a second birth after a longer interval, which will lead to a positively biased OLS estimator. Conversely, there is evidence that a higher quality first-born tends to bring the subsequent birth decision timing forward (Rosenzweig, 1986), resulting in a negatively biased OLS estimator. Previous studies exploit the variations in birth interval brought about by exogenous sources as solutions to this problem, such as miscarriages (Buckles and Munnich, 2012). However, miscarriages as household-level physiological events still inevitably suffer from endogenous determination to some degree. To mention another example, Sweden introduced a ”speed premium rule” to the parental leave system and started to offer benefit for short birth intervals less than two years in 1970s. It provides an exogenous resource shock as well as an incentive for short intervals and the effects on children’s outcomes are examined by Ginja et al. (2020); Pettersson-Lidbom and Thoursie (2009).====In this study, a natural experiment resulting from an exogenous Chinese regulation that forced long birth intervals between the first two births (usually over 4 years) or due to the maternal age at birth is considered. The variations in policy content and timing across provinces are exploited to construct an instrument for birth interval length. There are several benefits of the Chinese data for this study. First, as part of Chinese policy to curb fertility, the regulation on birth interval was one of the strictest and most straightforward policies worldwide, influencing a large population. Moreover, given that China remains a developing country fighting to alleviate poverty, it is a suitable context for studying effects on children’s nutrition status, which corresponds to basic needs but is of great importance to future outcomes as well.====When adopting an instrumental variable (IV) strategy, a sample selection type problem arises from the nature of interval data. Specifically, when birth interval is considered, it is assumed that at least a pair of children is already in the household. However, the decision to have a second child is a part of household self selection, as only among those households who choose to have a second child can birth interval be observed. If the parents’ decision on family size is highly correlated with their preference over birth interval, and meanwhile related to their children’s development, estimates on the effect of birth interval may be biased when the only-child households are ruled out. To address this incidental truncation problem, a Heckman selection model is combined with the IV regression to correct the self-selected number of children. Specifically, a probit regression on whether the household has a second child is first performed, taking the first child’s age in month at the survey date as an exogenous variable for exclusion restriction. The fitted inverse Mills ratio from the probit regression is then included in the main IV regression. Another related problem, which is less relevant to the second-stage estimate but still important, comes from a right-censoring issue caused by potentially uncompleted families. In other words, some households that have one child at the time of the survey but plan to have a second child in the future, would also be dropped from the sample. In such a case, among those households with a recently born first child, only short intervals can be observed. This right-censoring nature of fertility data would exaggerate the estimated effect of regulations on birth intervals because time variation in deregulation is one source of interval variation. Existing studies address this issue by using sufficiently old data or by setting a lower bound for the mother’s age to permit a robust assumption that no child will be born afterwards in the sample. Here, including the first child’s age (in months) in the probit model helps accommodate uncompleted families, allowing me to use more recent data. A survival analysis is further conducted as supplementary evidence of the effectiveness of birth interval regulation.====Height is taken as the main proxy for the first child’s nutrition status, considering that it can be a direct reflection of the child’s access to resources. The IV first stage regression shows that households being regulated prolong the birth interval, consistent with the policy expectation. This conclusion is also drawn from a survival analysis. Next, the 2SLS results provide evidence of a positive effect of subsequent birth interval on the first child’s height, with a one-year increase in birth interval increasing the height-for-age score by 0.323 standard deviations, which is equivalent to 2.11 cm taller for adult female or 2.36 cm taller for adult male. The OLS estimate is shown to be downward biased. Similarly, a one-year increase in birth interval is also shown to eliminate the probability of stunting by 7.3%.====Next, a quantile regression model is employed to examine the heterogeneous effects over the height distribution. Results show that the effect of birth interval is the largest at the second decile in the sample, where the height-for-age score is a bit lower than the threshold of stunting. The significant positive effect can be observed up to the third decile. These findings are in line with the expectation from resource dilution hypothesis.====Following a theoretical discussion accommodating the resource dilution hypothesis, I conduct a further heterogeneity analysis by gender composition to explore the potential mechanisms. Results suggest that a first child benefits more from a longer subsequent birth interval when the first child is female or the second child is male. This pattern is further confirmed by the results from a detailed gender composition division. The heterogeneity analysis results are consistent with predictions from the theoretical prediction, leading to the conclusion that resource dilution is a key driver of subsequent birth interval positively affecting children’s physical development.====This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, this study provides additional evidence on the determinants of birth interval length in the first step of the analysis. Second, I address the issue of possible endogeneity caused by potential correlations between birth interval length and unobserved household characteristics by using a direct policy regulation on birth interval as a natural experiment, enabling me to construct an instrument to estimate the causal effect. Third, as testing results may be sensitive to different measurements for child outcomes, to fill the gap in the literature, the focus in this study is on children’s height, which is an important indicator of child nutrition and development status at a broad age range. Fourth, by conducting heterogeneous analysis following a theoretical discussion, I look into potential mechanisms, testing the resource dilution hypothesis in the birth interval context. Fifth, this study examines the important but rarely analysed subsequent birth interval and investigate a broader range of interval lengths and not only the short intervals in the literature. Finally, to my knowledge, this study is among the first to study birth interval policy in China.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical analysis and predicts the empirical results. Section 3 introduces the family planning policies and children’s height in China, while Section 4 discusses the data and identification strategy.

The ==== treated secure a return that is, on average, 2 percentage points lower than ==== treatment. Thus, an `intention to treat' approach would not alter conclusions on the efficacy of training; but using the partially treated to estimate counterfactual outcomes risks understating returns.","Recent decades have seen the active labour market programme (ALMP) evaluation literature expand substantially (for a recent review see Filges et al., 2016). The increased availability of rich datasets has allowed studies to utilise extensive time periods, both before and after treatment (Sianesi, 2004; Lechner et al., 2007; Biewen et al., 2014); there has been some improved ability to identify detail of the training undertaken (Frölich, 2004; Sianesi, 2008; Lechner et al., 2011); and studies have been able to give more explicit consideration to the issue of `dropouts’ in experimental (Heckman et al., 1998a) and non-experimental settings (Paul, 2015; Choe et al., 2015).====This has led to an increase in the variety of methods used by researchers; characteristics of the programmes studied, and richness, or otherwise, of data used to capture differences between programmes (Biewen et al., 2014). Drawing on findings from across studies, there is some consensus that in the short run, programmes exhibit negative employment impacts due to lock-in effects; the duration and size of any such lock-in effects vary across programmes, but generally it takes two to three years for `meaningful' impacts to arise; and the extent to which training is mandated within a programme seems negatively related to estimated impacts (see for instance, Card et al., 2018). These studies also identify some consistent messaging on effect heterogeneity, with on-the-job training seen as more effective than classroom-based training.====Despite these important insights, many questions remain. McCall et al. (2016) note the lack of explicit consideration across studies of what constitutes training; they argue that researchers should focus on estimating separate impacts for different training types, in contexts where programmes cannot be `killed' for political reasons; and, noting `the strong evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects' (page 480), underline the need for insights that inform the matching of subgroups of unemployed to different interventions. A strong argument is made for future research that identifies effect heterogeneity below programme level. As more data becomes available to researchers, there are greater opportunities for such insights.====However, as this paper shows, richer data brings its own challenges. We analyse information from an exceptionally rich dataset, containing detailed information on training interventions, allowing us to contribute to the development of this evidence base. More specifically, the administrative data used in this study contain information for an English population of 2.3 million individuals with an unemployment benefits claim start date between 6th April 2006 and 5th April 2008. This has been linked to detailed information on all registered learning aims at English further education (FE) institutions between the 2002/2003 and 2012/2013 academic years. English FE Institutions are broadly equivalent to US Community Colleges,==== and most training for the unemployed is undertaken in these FE Institutions.==== We focus on training for the unemployed undertaken during the first 18 months of an unemployment spell, when training treatments are predominantly voluntary in nature: estimating effects for three categories of training, and focusing analysis on unemployed individuals aged between 25 and 55.====Relatively large numbers in both treatment and comparison groups allow us to use Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) (see Iacus et al., 2011), to create month-by-month estimates of employment effects, up to 5 years on from training start. We match [via CEM] on a variety of characteristics, including socio-demographic variables, prior qualifications====, a flag of basic skill need from a caseworker and up to 8 years of labour market and learning histories. Studies suggest that matching on such histories, better ensures the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) is met (Heckman and Smith, 1999; Lechner and Wunsch, 2013; and Caliendo et al., 2017), when considering selection into treatment start. The fact that we observe all training spells undertaken in FE during the period under analysis, allows us to counter many of the concerns around substitution (see Fay, 1996; Heckman et al., 1998a; Heckman et al., 2000).====Our focus is on training interventions taken up voluntarily that can occur at different points in each individual's unemployment spell. This potential for variation across individuals in the timing of treatment, raises similar concerns to those flagged in studies by Sianesi (2004; 2008), Fitzenberger et al. (2006), Fredriksson and Johansson (2008) and Biewen et al. (2014) concerning dynamic selection into treatment. Therefore, in each of our analyses we separately estimate employment impacts for (a) those who initiate training in the first two months of their unemployment spell; (b) those who first initiate training in the third or fourth months of unemployment; (c) those who first initiate training in the fifth or sixth months, and so on; up to the ninth analysis that considers those initiating training for the first time in the seventeenth and eighteenth months from claim start. In the following analysis, when comparing outcomes for these individuals with those of the `untreated', the latter group is made up of individuals who have not initiated training up to the specified point in time from claim start, but who may do so in future months. From here we therefore refer to this group as the ====. Following Sianesi (2008), we present figures that are aggregates of these treatment effects estimated by time of initiation, weighted according to the observed distribution of initiation across the nine separate periods.====This approach allows us to tackle concerns over selection into treatment start. However, the more substantive contribution of this paper arises from (i) our ability to identify amongst the treated those who do, and those who do not, achieve the learning outcomes of training (according to the trainer's assessment, which may involve some form of examination); and (ii) our investigation of the challenge of selection into full and partial treatment, following training initiation, that incorporation of this information presents. As richer sub-programme data become available, it is possible to investigate the challenges posed by McCall et al. (2016), but identification of the drivers of effect heterogeneity below programme level brings us to a perspective more often associated with the education economics literature. Our investigation highlights one of the key points of possible convergence between an ALMP evaluation literature where intention to treat approaches dominate; and an education economics literature, where achievers are often the central focus of attention in terms of estimated impacts====.====To investigate, we present estimated month-by-month employment effects following treatment start, using a variety of pair-wise comparisons; for each of our three categories of learning. First, we present the estimated employment impacts that arise from (A) comparison of all those who start a training treatment at a point in time [====], and those whom we do not observe initiating a treatment [====] up to that specified point in time, but who may do so in the future, up to 18 months from claim start date. Matching on lengthy employment histories and adopting the approach of Sianesi (2008), we invoke the Conditional Independence Assumption [CIA]. When comparing ==== with the ====, the main concern is selection into treatment start, and in this respect the existing literature provides support for this invocation of the CIA (Caliendo et al., 2017).====However, we then present estimated employment impacts that arise from pairwise comparisons which utilise the information we have on achievement (or otherwise) of learning outcomes (i.e. splitting the group of ==== into ==== and ==== treated). Specifically, we present estimated impacts associated with comparisons between (B) the ==== (who are recorded as achieving the learning aims of a training scheme) and the ====; and (C) the ==== (who enrol for this training, but are not recorded as achieving the learning outcomes) and the ====. Estimands from analysis under (B) and (C) are obtained using a similar approach to those under (A), as the causal contrast is between `training now' (whether this is for ====, the ==== or ==== at a point in time) versus `waiting' (i.e. those who at the same point in time are `currently untreated').====Finally, we present estimated impacts from comparison between (D) the ==== and the ====. Estimands obtained from this comparison differ to those under (A), (B) and (C) as unemployed individuals who start training during a given sub-interval and achieve [====], are compared to the unemployed who start training during the same sub-interval, but do not subsequently achieve the learning outcomes [====]. As a result, estimates obtained from (D) are closer to those used in standard cost-benefit frameworks, whilst this is not true of those under (A), (B) and (C).====McCall et al. (2016) suggest that these estimated impacts, `represent the impact of completing the training and, hopefully, now possessing the set of skills the training aims to provide'. Completion is a proxy for the securing of human capital, and it would seem important to attempt to utilise indicators of achievement where we have them. Comparisons (B), (C) and (D) allow us to utilise the information on achievement, but also introduce the potential for bias associated with selection following training start.====It is likely that selection into full treatment and partial treatment is non-random, and there are differences between the two groups that are correlated with outcomes. Because selection into full or partial treatment occurs after treatment start, our identification strategy will only remain valid under certain assumptions. Namely, that matching up to the point of training start captures all relevant information driving subsequent selection into partial or full treatment. For this to be valid, any unobserved factors driving selection into these two groups, must be uncorrelated with potential outcomes, having conditioned on observed learning and employment histories prior to treatment start. However, if there are unobserved factors that drive selection into partial/full treatment, and this information only arises following treatment start, we are at risk of bias in our comparison of effects from ==== and ==== treatment. Section 5.1 shows how our findings change when using distance to nearest FE training provider to instrument for selection into partial and full treatment – investigating the validity of estimates obtained under (B) to (D).====To ensure our distinction between partial and full treatment is located within the existing literatures, Section 2.1 considers the partial treatment framework of Heckman et al. (1998a); the literature on dropouts in ALMP studies (Kluve et al., 2012; Choe et al., 2015; Paul, 2015) and links this to the education economics literature that estimates impacts from vocational learning (Patrignani and Conlon, 2011; Buscha and Urwin, 2013; Jepsen et al., 2014; Bibby et al. 2014; Hedges et al., 2018).

We develop a model to show that enforcement authorities faced with capacity constraints or who are more susceptible to bribes set non-optimal ,"Private prisons proliferated in the U.S. since the mid-1980s.==== In 1984, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA, now CoreCivic) established the first privately-owned and -operated incarceration facility in Hamilton County, Tennessee (Mattera et al., 2001). The private prison industry experienced substantial growth through the late-1980s and early-1990s where annual industry revenues rose from $14 million in 1984 to $120 million in 1994 (Mattera et al., 2001). The capacity of private incarceration facilities increased from 3000 beds in 1984 to 20,000 beds in 1990, followed by annual increases of 50% until 1994 where it slowed to an annual increase of 25% for the latter half of the decade (Mattera et al., 2001).====One hypothesis raised concerns the impact of private prisons on incarceration rates in the U.S., which is highest in the world (Walmsley, 2018). The American Civil Liberties Union asserts private prisons significantly increased the incarceration rate in the U.S. since the mid-1980s (Shapiro, 2011). Stringent crime laws along with the private prisons may have contributed to the rise in incarceration rates. For example, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (""1994 Crime Bill"") increased funding for law enforcement and expanded punishments for a variety of offenses including weapons crimes, immigration violations, hate crimes, sex crimes, and gang-related crime. Such laws can facilitate underlying mechanisms which causally relate the increase in private prisons to incarceration rates.====One potential mechanism is through lobbying and direct contributions to politicians and officials in exchange for favorable policies which increase incarceration rates (Ashton and Petteruti, 2011). Two prominent examples illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism. First, in the “Kids for Cash” scandal in Luzerne, Pennsylvania, two judges received money from two private juvenile detention centers in exchange for harsh judgements on juvenile offenders to increase the number of residents in the centers (May, 2014). The judges sentenced minors convicted of misdemeanors to internment in private youth correctional facilities in exchange for $2.6 million in kickbacks. Second, lobby groups for private prisons supported California's three-strikes rule and Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law for harsher penalties on crimes and longer sentences (Cohen, 2015). CoreCivic lobbied for increased appropriation measures from the Office of Federal Detention Trustee and for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to maintain or increase the “bed quota,” a policy mandating a minimum of 34,000 inmates at any given time regardless of illegal immigration levels (Ashton and Petteruti, 2011).====Another mechanism is overcrowding in public prisons (Wilson, 2014), which might dissuade judges from assigning marginal convicts to prison. Private prisons may reduce this capacity constraint, leading to more incarcerations. The role of these mechanisms remains unstudied. There is also gap in the literature in understanding the channels by which private prisons influence incarceration levels such as incentivizing arrest rates leading to more trials, influencing guilty verdicts, or changing the individual likelihood of incarceration over probation.====This article explores the effect of establishing private prisons on incarceration rates in the United States. First, we build a model on sentencing to illustrate how sanctions are skewed in favor of owners of private prisons to increase incarceration rates at the extensive margin (aggregate number of prisoners) and the intensive margin (sanction level per prisoner). Next, we empirically estimate the effect of the number of private prisons on incarceration rates for different types of crimes and across time before and after the 1994 Crime Bill. We examine two mechanisms to test our theoretical prediction: capacity constraints of public prisons and corruption of enforcement authorities.==== Finally, we decompose the impact of these mechanisms through their effect on three channels: number of trials, guilty sentences, and the likelihood of receiving a prison sentence conditional on conviction. This is the first study which provides a theoretical mechanism by which private prisons influence incarceration rates and empirically tests the theoretical results.====We contribute to the public law enforcement and sentencing literature in three ways. Our main contribution is in the empirical literature on private prisons. There is very little empirical evidence related to the determinants and effects of private prisons. Most empirical work on private prisons compares the public and private prison cost differential to see if savings exist in the latter compared to the former. Private prisons have lower construction and operating costs but there is poor management quality because of moral hazard, asymmetric information or incomplete contracting issues (Kish and Lipton 2013). Mukherjee (2019) showed sentences of inmates in private prisons in Mississippi were significantly larger than their public prison counterparts for the same crime. We have not come across any empirical estimation which analyzes the impact of private prisons on aggregate incarceration rates.====Next, we contribute to the relatively small literature which analyzes the determinants of incarceration rates. Incarceration rates across U.S. states depend on a variety of socioeconomic, legal and political factors. Race and income inequality are significant indirect factors which affect incarceration rates (Arvanites and Asher, 1998; Yates, 1997). Political factors such as partisan control of the legislature, voting cycles and partisan control of the executive office contribute significantly to incarceration rates (Smith, 2004). Ideological orientations of enforcement authorities (Percival, 2010) and a country's legal origin (D'Amico and Williamson, 2015) also affect incarceration rates. None of these studies consider the role of private prisons.====Finally, we contribute to the theoretical literature on public law enforcement choice and sentencing.==== Polinsky and Shavell (1982,1984) show the optimal sanction which maximizes welfare is equal to the harm caused by the individual. Andreoni (1991) found equilibrium-derived penalties are superior to uniform penalties, which could encourage crime due to interdependence between penalties and conviction probabilities. Daugherty and Reinganum (2000) model sentencing decisions by a court which Bayesian updates its priors based on appeal decisions and their expectations about higher court interpretations to minimize the chances of overrules. Lundberg (2016) finds juries and judges issue “compromise verdicts” with a guilty verdict and relatively light sentence when confronted with uncertainty. These models do not incorporate bribes to enforcement authority and there are no prison capacity constraints.====We model how capacity constraints and lobbying affect sentencing lengths of an enforcement authority. We adapt Polinsky and Shavell (1984) by incorporating prison capacity constraints and use a common agency model to illustrate how owners of private prisons influence the sanction levels imposed by the enforcement authority. We find enforcement authorities which are more susceptible to corruption or face capacity constraints set non-optimal sanctions leading to higher incarceration rates at the extensive and intensive margins.====We collect data on individual-level trial outcomes from the United States Sentencing Commission which we aggregate by state to form incarceration rate data. We match this data with private prison numbers across states, demographic variables, measures of capacity constraints and a proxy for lobbying susceptibility. We use an instrumental variable regression to estimate the effect of private prisons on incarceration rates.====Simultaneity bias is likely where higher incarceration rates leads to more demand for private prisons. The proliferation of private prisons started in 1984 during the Reagan administration. The Reagan administration embraced privatization as a “strategy for minimalist government and deficit reduction” (Tingle, 1988). Studies from think tanks and academic institutions were significant factors in influencing policies which led to smaller governments, free market and trade and deregulation (Hacker and Pierson, 2017; Ravitch, 2017; Komlos, 2018). We proxy the rise in the privatization ideology by compiling the number of economic studies on pro-privatization by state and using the data to construct a knowledge stock index similar to Popp (2002) as an instrument for the number of private prisons. This instrument is likely to influence a state policymaker's decision to allow private prisons but it has no direct effect on incarceration rates. Our Stock-Yogo test results show that our instrument is not weak.====We show that private prisons have a significant effect on aggregate state incarceration levels. Furthermore, the incarceration rate at the extensive margin increases with more private prisons for some crimes such as fraud, drug offenses, property crimes and weapons crimes. Private prisons also have an effect on incarceration at the intensive margin on sentencing length for fraud, drug offenses, regulatory and weapons crimes. The 1994 Crime Bill led to private prisons increasing weapons crimes incarcerations, which was one of its intended target, but it also increased other non-violent incarcerations such as fraud, public order and regulatory crimes. This may have been due to the three-strikes law. The corruption and capacity constraint mechanisms yield mixed results. Finally, the likely channel of increased incarceration rates is from more guilty verdicts and an increase in incarceration likelihood in corrupt states.",Do privately-owned prisons increase incarceration rates?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301123,5 September 2020,2020,Research Article,251.0

While any student loan increases unemployment, the effects on welfare and ==== depend on the purpose of the loan: A loan for tuition fees reduces human capital and credit accessibility, the college premium increases significantly, and welfare declines. A loan spent on consumption increases education and credit accessibility, while wage ==== and welfare change marginally.","In the past years, the “student loan bubble” and the “student loan crisis” have captured increasing attention by the media, politicians, and economists. Student debt as share of total non-mortgage consumer debt has increased from 10.5% in 2001 to 32.2% in 2017 (Center for Microeconomic Research, 2018). There is significant international heterogeneity of public funding for tertiary education and tuition fees for both public and private education. Table 1 summarises the tuition fees for national bachelor students in selected countries as well as differences in the loans after tertiary education for 2017/18. In some countries like Germany or Switzerland, tuition fees are very low or basically non-existent. In contrast, in the UK or the United States, tuition for public education is about $10000 a year, increasing to almost $30000 for private institutions in the US.====Students in these countries use various types and extents of loans to finance tuition fees plus other costs that occur during their studies. While the different systems and missing data (especially for countries with less expensive tertiary education) make it hard to compare particular details, the data show that significant shares of students in the more expensive countries such as Australia, Canada, England and the United States graduate with substantial debt.====While rising tuition fees and declining public contributions to colleges have contributed to these loans, there is also evidence that students take on higher or more expensive loans than necessary. For the United States, Gonzalez et al. (2019) report that “more than half (53%) of undergraduates who took out private loans in 2015-16 did not use the maximum available in federal student loans” (Gonzalez et al., 2019) even though the interest rates for private loans are significantly higher than the 4.53% interest rate on federal loans. A survey by Wilbert and Haddad (2014) among 962 students finds that 23.1% of the students who consume “luxury items and services” such as television game systems, pedicures/manicures, going out to eat, or vacations, choose to use their loans to pay for these luxury items. One might argue that this is just irrational overspending by young adults or an attempt to intertemporarily smooth consumption. However, this paper shows that in presence of credit and labour market frictions, students can increase the net present value of their consumption by strategically overusing student loans.====There is a large strand of literature discussing credit market frictions and borrowing constraints for students. While firms that invest in machines can offer this physical capital as collateral, banks cannot directly seize a student’s education, skills and knowledge. This may restrict the credit market access of potential students with few own funds and can prevent efficient investments in human capital (Galor and Zeira, 1993). Even for the high school graduates who have access to student loans, credit market imperfections distort the education decision if banks exhibit market power and extract rents.====Once a worker has graduated she must apply her skills in imperfect labour markets. Informational and coordination frictions prevent the invisible hand from clearing the market and give rise to unemployment and unfilled vacancies. Amongst others, Acemoglu (1997), Albrecht and Vroman (2002) and Sato and Sugiura (2003) consider the effects of these imperfections on human capital. Acemoglu and Shimer (1999) show how labour market imperfections can create hold-up problems that distort the incentives to invest in capital: the costs of investing in capital are already sunk when firms and workers later decide how to split the surplus of a worker-firm match. Therefore, these costs are not considered during the wage-bargaining process. If investors pay the entire costs but only receive a fraction of the benefits of their investment due to the market power of their counterpart, investment is inefficiently low. Acemoglu and Shimer (1999) focus on physical capital, but the same mechanism works for human capital: The worker pays for her education, but when firms and workers bargain on the wage these costs are sunk. However, Moen (1998) argues that contingent loans shift the costs of education back into the wage-bargaining process and seem to solve the hold-up problem: workers pay the credit rates for their student loan only while they are employed at a firm, but the payment is interrupted if a worker becomes unemployed. This way the credit rates are considered as opportunity costs of working during the surplus splitting and efficiency is restored. In a related study, Kaas and Zink (2011) use a model with directed search to illustrate that contingent loans provide incentives to search for jobs that offer higher wages, giving rise to higher unemployment.====This paper shows how such a combination of imperfect credit and labour markets shifts some burden of the student loans from students to firms and unskilled workers. In order to model the informational frictions and the complicated procedure of finding the best way to pay for college, I do not assume an exogenous borrowing constraint, but students must first ==== for a bank that provides a student loan. The imperfections on the credit market are similar to the ones on the labour market, both with search frictions in the spirit of Pissarides (2000). It takes some time to obtain a loan (or respectively for banks to find a borrower), depending on the ratio of the credit supply of banks to the credit demand of prospective students. This approach not only keeps the model tractable, but also accommodates the findings of Carneiro and Heckman (2002) that direct credit constraints prevent only a small fraction of young women and men from acquiring higher education. Thus, “softer” credit constraints, such as search frictions, are more suitable to model the credit market for student loans. Moreover, search frictions are also a natural way to model the information frictions for students and the heterogeneity of the various credit options. For instance, a student who consults the website of Wells Fargo==== for current rates for student loans must first choose the school state, the particular school, and the student’s field of study. The following website (using students in economics at the UCLA as an example) then suggests 8 different loans (5 of them being consolidation loans), each of the 8 with different “lowest rates” and “highest rates”, where both categories allow to choose again between variable and fixed rates, and each interest rate is reported as “interest rate” and “APR”, including remarks regarding originating fees (or their absence). This process makes it very hard to compare different credit options at different banks. Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2006) argue that also the federal system for student aid is too complex in order to achieve its redistributive goals. In a natural experiment, Stoddard et al. (2017) show that students who receive information on their individual student loan debt improve their academic outcomes. However, they do not adjust their borrowing.====In our the model, students pay an endogenous interest rate above the risk-free rate on their debt. Wasmer and Weil (2004) use an analogous approach to show how imperfect markets for venture capital amplify the adverse effects of labour market imperfections, and how even moderate frictions on both markets are sufficient to generate substantial unemployment. The credit market for student loans differs from the credit market for venture capital in various dimensions. In particular, students usually can offer only little collateral, and in contrast to physical capital, human capital cannot be seized if the student cannot pay back his credit. While “only” 11.5% of all student loans were delinquent for at least 90 days in Q3 2018 (Center for Microeconomic Research, 2018), a significantly higher share of students with student loans go through some periods of default. According to Scott-Clayton (2018), 27.2% of the students who entered college in 2004 had defaulted on a student loan at least once in the following 12 years. They project that the cumulative default rate of this cohort will rise to 38.2% within 20 years after these students had entered college. This demonstrates that a lot of students struggle to pay their credit rates for an extended amount of time, for instance during unemployment. However, in contrast to most other types of debt, it is very hard to declare bankruptcy on student loans.==== This also explains why the outstanding student loan debt does not decline significantly during recessions. As soon as the borrower finds a new job, he has to continue to pay the credit rates. Table 1 shows that countries use a variety of different loan types, including contingent loans where students can apply for hardship deferment if their current income is below a given threshold. I implement this observation by assuming that the credit takes the form of a contingent loan. That is, banks and students anticipate (or even explicitly write into the credit contract) that workers cannot pay full credit rates while they are unemployed, but that the credit cannot be forgiven. As soon as the worker finds a new job, the credit rates are paid again.====This provides incentives for workers and banks to strategically use contingent loans to establish higher wages for well educated workers. The main mechanism works as follows: the imperfections in both markets give all participants some bargaining power when they decide how to split the surplus of a bank-worker match (the bargaining on the credit contract) and a firm-worker match (the wage bargaining). As workers must only pay back the contingent loan during employment, the repayments are considered as part of the opportunity costs of working. Therefore, firms compensate skilled workers for a share of their credit costs via higher wages. Banks and workers internalise this effect when they bargain on the credit contract, giving rise to higher credit rates and a further increase in wages for skilled workers. Thus, students are willing to accept higher credit rates, anticipating that they will be at least partially compensated by higher wages.====An increase in student loans can be used to pay for higher tuition fees or to finance more consumption. While in both cases some of the costs are indirectly paid by firms and low-skilled workers, they have opposing effects on credit supply and the incentives to study. If loans increase because tuition fees rise, the increase in wages for college graduates is not sufficient to compensate students for the higher costs of education. Thus, the surplus of a match between a student and a bank declines, fewer people go to college and credit supply tightens. In contrast, if loans increase to pay for consumption, the surplus between student and bank rises: The credit is a transfer between both parties, but firms increase wages to compensate workers for higher loans. Thus, if loans grow in order to pay for more consumption, the incentives to study increase and credit supply rises. Students have an incentive to take on excess student loans to pay for consumption despite significant premia on the interest rates.====A numerical simulation illustrates some additional quantitative results: While both types of student loans increase unemployment as well as the college premium, and both types of loans reduce welfare, these effects are stronger if the loan is used to pay for tuition fees. An increase in student debt to pay for consumption has only marginal effects on unemployment, welfare, and the skill premium, and it has even a positive (albeit small) effect on the wages of low-skilled workers.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the economic environment, Section 3 derives the equilibrium. Section 4 simulates two experiments, an increase in student loans to pay for higher tuition fees and another increase to pay for higher consumption. Section 5 allows for risk-averse workers and discusses the implications for the main mechanism of the model.

It is based on a very informative data set, the German Motorik-Modul, and identifies the effect by using variation in the required numbers of physical education lessons across German federal states. The results suggest improvements in academic achievements. Boys’ non-cognitive skills are adversely affected driven by increased peer relation problems. For girls, the results show improvements in motor skills and increased extra-curricular ====. Generally, we find no statistically significant effects on health parameters.","The goals of physical education (PE) are manyfold. UNESCO (2014) analyses PE curricula worldwide. It documents that most PE curricula intend to provide beneficial effects along five domains: (i) support academic achievements, (ii) foster personal and social development (non-cognitive skills), (iii) improve basic motor skills, (iv) encourage physical activity in and out of school, and (v) improve health. This means PE's goal is to improve human capital accumulation. Especially the development of the first two domains are essential determinants of future labour market outcomes (see, e.g., Kautz et al., 2014). However, also the other three targeted domains might play an important role given the evidence that a physically active lifestyle (e.g., Lechner, 2009) and health (e.g., Cawley and Ruhm, 2011) are drivers of labour market success.====Thus, it is not surprising that politicians and health organisations, among others, frequently promote increasing PE. The US Surgeon General recommends 150-225 min per week of PE (Benjamin, 2010), while the average time of PE in the US is less than 90 min per week (Cawley et al., 2013).==== In Europe, several countries discuss minimum PE levels of one PE lesson per school day, which would lead to a considerable increase compared to current levels. For example, Austria introduced daily PE lessons for all-day schools in 2015 and plans to extend it for all schools.==== However, the empirical evidence about the effects of PE at school is scarce and inconclusive. This is unfortunate because increasing time in PE requires substantial investments in new facilities and teachers as well as rearrangements of the curricula. Furthermore, there may be implicit costs in terms of children's human capital, as the additional time in PE has to come either from reducing hours of other subjects or a reduction in the children's leisure time. Consequently, policymakers, parents, and children need reliable evidence regarding the effects of different numbers of PE lessons to be able to judge whether the potential benefits of a future policy change outweigh its costs.====A large body of evidence documents the (short-term) effectiveness of school-based interventions on specific domains.==== However, these kinds of interventions are usually not permanent and taught by specially trained staff. Thus, it is not clear whether their results carry over to standard PE taught by regular teachers in regular schools. While the studies of temporary interventions are mostly experimental, the identification of the effects of regular PE is complicated by potential selection into schools providing more or less PE. Parents and children might have preferences for more or less PE and choose schools accordingly. Further, the amount of PE could vary with the quality of schools. On the one hand, high quality schools could offer less PE and devote more time to academic subjects. On the other hand, high quality schools could provide more PE because of their better infrastructure. Controlling for all these factors would be challenging and requires very detailed information about parents and schools. We are aware of three studies that address the selection into PE by using instrumental variables (Cawley et al., 2013; Cawley et al., 2007; Dills et al., 2011) and one that uses a difference-in-differences approach (Sabia et al., 2016). We discuss these papers in the next section.====Our study contributes to the limited literature about the effects of regular PE in two ways. (i) The unique German Motorik-Modul dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of all five domains of intended PE effects. (ii) We exploit differences in PE requirements across and within German federal states to identify the causal effects of PE. This provides a stronger instrument compared to the previous literature and is exploited in a semi-parametric instrumental variable (IV) estimator to relax functional form assumptions. Most importantly, the data allow us to run a placebo test with pre-school children to address remaining endogeneity concerns. The placebo test shows no systematic differences for pre-school children before they are exposed to PE, which raises confidence in our empirical findings.====Our results show improved school grades, but adverse effects on non-cognitive skills, measured as increasing behavioural problems. The adverse effects are observed only for boys, while girls benefit even in terms of lower emotional symptoms. This suggests gender differences in the effectiveness of PE. In addition, we find improved motor skills and increased extra-curricular physical activities for girls. Effects on motor skills and extra-curricular physical activities seem to be much smaller, if not absent, for boys. Regardless of gender, we find no statistically significant effects on any health parameter.====The paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a brief literature review of the effects of regular PE. Section 3 describes the institutional setting generating the exogenous variation that we exploit. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 explains the empirical strategy. Section 6 shows descriptive statistics of the relevant variables. Section 7 presents the results, some heterogeneity analysis, and investigates the sensitivity of the results.

The positive employment effects are consistent with a rise in sectoral employment operating through increased demand due to immigrants. In negatively affected sectors, we estimate quarterly displacement effects of 4 natives for every 100 additional immigrants residing in a region. Both the positive and negative effects on employment tend to dissipate over time.","The debate over the effects of migration on the wages and employment of native workers is a long standing one in the labor economics literature. Several studies exploit the heterogeneous distribution of immigrants across local labor markets to derive causal estimates of these effects. Many of these studies find little or no impact of migration on wages or employment.==== To explain the lack of effects, the literature has documented different channels through which either native workers or firms respond to migration over time, equalizing wages and employment opportunities across local labor markets (e.g., Borjas, 2006, Lewis, 2011, Peri, Sparber, 2009).==== The existence of these channels suggests that the short-run effects of migration on labor market outcomes may differ from the medium- or long-run effects.====This study provides new estimates of the impact of migration on the employment and wages of natives in the very short run. This is accomplished using quarterly data while exploiting the unique characteristics of the migration to Italy resulting from the Arab Spring.====There are multiple reasons why the migration that followed the Arab Spring is particularly suitable for this analysis. First, the political instability in North Africa was likely exogenous to the dynamics prevailing in Italian labor markets at the time of the uprisings. Second, the Arab Spring caused a large spike in immigrants to Italy within a relatively brief period. In the first 6 months of 2011, the share of immigrants residing in Italy and originating from the Arab Spring countries of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen increased by 23%. Finally, the Arab Spring induced only temporary migration to Italy, as the stock of Arab Spring immigrants residing in Italy returned to levels close to those of the pre-Arab Spring period by the end of 2011. The temporary nature of this migration event is consistent with the argument, often mentioned in the media, that once in Italy, immigrants may attempt to move towards other European countries that offer better opportunities.==== The temporary, unanticipated and exogenous nature of the Arab Spring migration combined with the use of quarterly data makes it possible to isolate the immediate effects of migration from the longer-run adjustments that it induced.====Our estimation strategy exploits the heterogeneous distribution of immigrants across Italian regions. As in many studies that exploit the geographical variation in migration flows, we account for endogenous settlements by using the share of immigrants from the Arab Spring countries previously living in each Italian region as an instrument for the distribution of immigrants across regions during the Arab Spring. We combine this static measure of migration intensity with the change in the flow of illegal entries into Italy over the same period to form a dynamic instrument.====Three general findings emerge from this analysis. First, while the short-run effect of migration on overall native employment is insignificant, we find significant and offsetting effects across industries. In particular, we find that the Arab Spring migration had a positive effect on the employment of natives in construction and educational services and a negative effect in wholesale trade, hotels and restaurants. In the industries in which employment was negatively affected, temporary migration had significant and sizable immediate effects, with an estimated displacement of 4 natives per 100 additional immigrants residing in a region. In the sectors in which employment was positively affected, we estimate that, on average, 6 natives found a job per 100 additional immigrants residing in a region. To explain these positive employment effects, we discuss the possibility that employment in educational services and construction increased as an effect of the contemporaneous increase in economic activity and labor demand induced by the Arab Spring migration.====Second, both the positive and negative employment effects tend to dissipate over time. As immigrants leave Italy, we find that native employment gradually converges back to the pre-Arab Spring level in most sectors. While the temporary nature of the Arab Spring migration makes comparisons with other studies difficult, these findings are generally in line with the literature on the dynamic adjustments of labor markets to migration. This literature, based on more permanent migration events, also finds effects that decline over time (Cohen-Goldner, Paserman, 2011, Monras, 2019).====Third, we find no evidence of statistically significant effects of migration on the wages of natives, which suggests that wages are rigid in the very short run. This is consistent with the institutionalized nature of the wage-setting mechanism in Italy and with the predictions from the literature suggesting that reduced flexibility in the labor market can amplify the negative effects of migration on employment while reducing the impact on wages (e.g., Angrist and Kugler, 2003).====Estimating the short-term effects of temporary migration is relevant for multiple reasons. First, our analysis provides a way of understanding what happens soon after immigrants enter a labor market. A finer assessment of those mechanisms may better inform the political debate on migration and help to reconcile the empirical evidence of little or no effect of migration with the fact that migration remains at the core of the political debate in many countries. Second, while the literature has extensively focused on the effects of migration on final destination regions, to date, there is less evidence on the labor market effects of migration in states that are located between the origin and final destination countries (i.e., intermediary regions). The results of this study could thus be relevant to intermediary regions that experience temporary migration events. In Europe, for example, the Balkan states and the Southern European countries may serve as a bridge between the Middle East or Africa and Northern European countries. In Central America, Mexico is known to channel immigrants from Central and South America to the United States and Canada (García, 2006, Hamilton, Chinchilla, 1991). In the United States, border states such as Arizona or New Mexico may be subject to the temporary migration across the Mexican border.====Several existing studies analyze migration events that last for years or decades. In doing so, they estimate the long-run effects of migration. Fewer studies focus on short-lived migration waves triggered by exogenous factors, and those that do use data at annual or lower frequencies (e.g., Card, 1990, Carrington, De Lima, 1996, Hunt, 1992). While the short-lived migration events previously studied are usually associated with a permanent increase in the number of immigrants residing in the destination regions, the increase due to the Arab Spring in Italy was only temporary. The use of higher frequency data combined with the temporary nature of the increase in residing immigrants results in a greater possibility of capturing the most immediate effects of migration.====Our study relates to the recent literature on the effects of Syrian refugees on the local labor markets of host countries (e.g., Ceritoglu, Yunculer, Torun, Tumen, 2017, Del Carpio, Wagner, 2015, Tumen, 2016). Our setting, however, differs from those of these studies in two important respects. First, Syrian refugees generally stayed in the host country for longer than the Arab Spring immigrants did in Italy. Second, unlike the Syrian refugees in Turkey, for instance, most of the Arab Spring immigrants received a permit to work soon after arrival. This allowed them to take jobs in the formal sector, which likely resulted in easier and more rapid access to the labor market. Both of these aspects explain our greater focus on the short-term effects of migration and the use of higher frequency data. Our study also complements the work of Dustmann et al. (2017) that analyzes the effects of the temporary migration of Czech workers to Germany. In contrast to their work, we analyze the effects of a migration event that was forced by civil unrest rather than voluntary migration. As highlighted in recent work, forced and voluntary migration can have different consequences on labor markets (Becker and Ferrara, 2019).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the migration through Italy resulting from the Arab Spring. Section 3 discusses the data. Section 4 introduces the empirical methodology.

Some of these studies have relied upon education-experience groups to define labor markets and identify the wage elasticity with respect to immigrant labor supply. However, evidence suggests that immigrants’ educational attainment is treated differently in the labor market and constructing labor markets based upon this characteristic leads to potentially biased conclusions. We utilize O*NET occupational characteristics to form a different set of labor markets. Our analysis finds higher partial equilibrium effects on native wages than prior work using education-experience skill groups, as expected. These larger effects, however, are shown to be concentrated on the least skilled natives. Estimates of the total wage effect along the distribution of occupational skills confirm that the negative wage effect is concentrated on native workers in the bottom tail of the distribution. Natives in the upper tail of the distribution experience wage gains as a result of immigration. The distributional impact is likely due to the distribution of skills among recent immigrants.","A simple labor market model of supply and demand implies that immigration to a local labor market will result in falling wages, ====. Examining the implications of immigration on local labor markets has been an important topic in recent years, both within the economic literature and in the popular press. However, as recent surveys suggest (Kerr and Kerr, 2011; Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016), the results are far from uniform. A difficulty in estimating the impact of immigration on earnings is identifying and isolating labor markets. It has become standard in one strand of the literature to analyze the impact of immigration on groups of similarly skilled native workers as defined by education and work experience. This approach, pioneered by Borjas (2003), implicitly assumes that these education-experience groups identify labor markets in which immigrants and natives are perfect substitutes. However, the assumption of perfect substitutability has been challenged, and estimates suggest that a degree of ==== substitutability exists between immigrants and natives within these education-experience groups (Card, 2009; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012; Dustmann and Preston, 2012; Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012; Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth, 2012). As pointed out by Ottaviano and Peri (2012), this fact is nontrivial. If immigrants and natives are imperfect substitutes, then any wage effect of immigration would be concentrated on existing immigrants, not natives.====The result that education is an imperfect proxy for overall skill level, and especially so for immigrants, is well-documented in the literature. First, there is significant wage dispersion ==== education groups (Murnane, Willett, and Levy, 1995; Ingram and Neumann, 2006). This suggests that skills other than educational attainment are being rewarded in the labor market. Second, immigrants earn less than similarly educated natives (Bratsberg and Terrell, 2002; Bratsberg and Ragan, 2002; Ferrer and Riddell, 2008). This fact has been attributed to differing employment distributions across occupations and a lower return to education for immigrant workers. Several scenarios exist for the above differentials in returns to education. First, there may be more uncertainty about the quality of education received by immigrants abroad, leading employers to hedge against the possibility that the immigrant's education is lower quality. Second, language barriers limit the value of similarly educated immigrants. Third, immigrants face differential returns to education due to downgrading upon arrival in the US (Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016; Friedberg, 2000; Mattoo Neagu, and Özden, 2008; Neagu, 2009; Sharpe, 2015). Sharpe (2015) uses O*NET data for the required level of education needed to adequately perform a job and finds that immigrants are twice as likely to be overeducated as natives for the positions they hold. The difference in over-education rates increases with the amount of schooling and is most profound for highly educated, newly arrived immigrants. We do not investigate these causes, but rather note that immigrants enter the US and are pushed toward jobs in which they possess too much education compared to the average worker.====Prior studies have used several methods to account for the imperfect substitutability between immigrants and natives. Some have turned to estimating the elasticity of substitution between immigrants and natives and simulating the total wage effect of immigration on native wages (Mancorda, Manning, and Wadsworth, 2012; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012; Peri and Sparber, 2009; among others). The validity of this approach, however, has been questioned, as the estimated elasticities of substitution are not robust to changes in key assumptions (Borjas, Grogger, and Hanson, 2012). Llull (2018b) improves upon this framework by allowing imperfect substitutability to enter endogenously into a structural model of the labor market that flexibly defines labor market competition based on “skill units” and occupation. Others have moved away from the education-experience group analysis altogether and analyzed varying definitions of skill groups: based on the native wage distribution (Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012) and occupation groups (Camarota, 1997; Card, 2001; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2007; Steinhardt, 2011). Other studies have focused on specific industries (Bratsberg and Raaum, 2012) or used natural experiments where immigrants were exogenously allocated (Friedberg, 2001; Glitz, 2012). Dustmann and Glitz (2015) examine firm level adjustments, including factor utilization and firm level decisions to enter or exit. Friedberg (2001) uses occupation prior to immigration as an instrument, an approach we consider below.====We propose that stratifying the labor market by occupation rather than education results in an improved measure of labor market competition. Existing studies incorporating occupations as a proxy for skill are relatively sparse. Camarota (1997) uses one CPS cross-section to estimate the impact of immigration on wages within occupations and finds that a 1% increase in immigration will decrease the wages of the average native worker by 0.5%. However, the use of a single cross-section and small within-occupation sample size makes causal inference difficult. Card (2001) estimates city-specific impacts of immigration on occupational wages for 175 cities using 1990 US Census data and finds that the immigration inflows of the 1980’s decreased wages in low-skilled occupations in high-immigration cities by no more than 3%. Orrenius and Zavodny (2007) use CPS data from 1994–2000 and INS immigration data to estimate the impact of immigration on native wages in three broad occupation categories. The authors estimate that the change in immigrants over the data period decreased wages in low-skilled, manual occupations by 0.8% and had no impact for medium-skilled and high-skilled occupations. In the case of the German labor market, Steinhardt (2011) shows that the relative wage effect of immigration on native wages is larger when stratifying the labor market by occupation compared to stratifying the labor market by education. Specifically, when stratifying by occupation, the results imply a statistically significant wage elasticity of -0.134. When stratifying by education, however, the resulting estimates are statistically insignificant.====To improve upon the studies using skill group methodology, we propose constructing labor markets by using occupation groups with similar ==== requirements along with experience. Whereas prior skill group studies using occupations have relied on broad Census-defined occupation groups, we construct occupation groups using skill data from the O*NET. The use of O*NET data enables us to construct occupation groups with a greater degree of homogeneity in overall skill level, regardless of nationality and citizenship status, than those using either education groups or broad occupation classifications. Section 2 presents the details of our data and the methodology used to construct occupation-experience groups.====Our primary result, presented in Section 3, incorporates our occupation classification to estimate the impact of immigrants on wages in the national labor market. This approach is compared to estimates obtained by Borjas (2003). As expected if grouping workers by occupational characteristics is an improvement in constructing labor markets, we find that the partial equilibrium effect of immigration on native wages is 4 -5 times larger than the effect estimated utilizing markets defined by education group. This result is robust to several different definitions of occupation groups defined on the basis of occupational skill.====Two potential concerns arise from the initial analysis. First, stratifying labor markets by occupations may introduce bias, as occupational choice is potentially endogenous. Second, the national labor market approach identifies the partial equilibrium effect of immigration on native wages: the effect of immigration on the wages of experienced native workers relative to inexperienced native workers in the same occupation (or education) group (Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016).====We address the endogeneity concern in two approaches. First, in Section 3, we use a shift share instrument, similar to Llull (2018a) and others, as one specification of our main model. For our second approach, we estimate competition intensity for the usual education-experience groups by using demographic data to identify native workers who are comparable to immigrants. We then estimate the impact in each of these competition groups. In both exercises, the estimates are similar or larger than our initial estimates, further supporting the importance of constructing appropriate labor market groups.====In Section 4, we use our occupation classification to estimate the total wage effect of immigration along the distribution of occupational skills (Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012). This approach addresses the second concern, as it provides estimates over the distribution, allowing for significant heterogeneity. Additionally, this section adds to the literature which has shown that the effect of immigration on natives is concentrated on the least-skilled native workers who are most substitutable to immigrant labor. While the estimated wage effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero in the middle of the skill distribution, we estimate large and statistically significant effects in each tail of the distribution. Specifically, we estimate a wage elasticity of -0.5 in the bottom tail where natives are substitutable to immigrant labor and a wage elasticity of roughly 0.3-0.8 in the upper tail where natives are complementary to immigrant labor.",Who competes with whom?

We study the value of such options and the extent to which they correct initial ‘misplacement’. We find that the value of second-chance options is large but heterogenous. They are more valuable for high-ability individuals and individuals from better parental backgrounds who are better able to exploit the possibilities opened up by them at later stages of the system. Our findings suggest that second-chance options correct earlier “misplacement” only to a moderate extent.,"A large literature has studied the returns to education and their relationship to educational choices (Heckman and Lafontaine, 2006 for an overview). In many education systems, educational choices take the form of a decision about whether or not to add another year or another stage of the system to one’s educational qualification. This motivates the use of years of education as a measure of educational qualifications. However, there are a large number of education systems that do not exhibit this linear structure but are characterized by multiple tracks, different stages and potentially complex routes to final educational degrees. This is particularly true of systems with tracking structures which stream individuals into different tracks, often at an early age. Aspects that have been found to be important for education systems with a more linear structure such as dynamic ability sorting (Cameron, Heckman, 1998, Cameron, Heckman, 2001) and heterogeneous returns to individual transitions (e.g., Heckman and Lafontaine, 2006) appear even more important in systems with multiple stages and multiple tracks. Importantly, these aspects are related to a number of features of tracked education systems that have been considered as critical, such as whether these systems are able to efficiently allocate individuals to final educational qualifications, or whether overly rigid tracking structures lock individuals into certain tracks.====This paper studies heterogenous wage returns to educational decisions in the German education system. The German system is internationally known as a prototypical tracking system and “is considered today the starkest example of early tracking” (Brunello et al., 2012). It streams individuals into three different branches of secondary schooling at a very early age (typically ten years). What is less known internationally is that – despite its pronounced tracking structure – the system provides the possibility to switch tracks at many points and to take indirect routes to particular educational outcomes. The goal of this paper is to study to what extent the existence of such “second-chance” options can relax the rigid structure of an early tracking system. This is an important question as tracked education systems are very common and they often face the criticism of being too rigid and inflexible. As we show below, a remarkably high proportion of individuals takes second-chance decisions in the system studied by us. We estimate the value of such options, describe who exercises them and assess to what extent they compensate earlier inflexibilities in allocating students to tracks.====Our paper appears to be the first one to evaluate the existence of second-chance options in an otherwise rigid early tracking system. To this end, we employ the state-of-the-art dynamic treatment effects methodology proposed by Heckman, Humphries, Veramendi, 2016, Heckman, Humphries, Veramendi, 2018 in order to model the sequence of all relevant educational transitions in the education system jointly with the associated wage outcomes at the relevant final degrees. Our paper is one of the first ones to apply this framework in a decision environment that is considerably more complex than the college vs. no college decision usually considered in education economics. As a by-product of our analysis, we provide new results on the returns to a wide range of educational degrees in Germany. We consider degrees that have not or that have rarely been studied before such as the advanced vocational degree of a master craftsman or the choice between different types of academic education (general universities vs. more practically oriented universities of applied sciences). We explicitly allow for heterogenous returns to individual decisions depending on observed and unobserved characteristics. This allows us to address the question whether individuals sort into particular branches of the system based on their expected gains.====Our results suggest that the value of the second-chance options built into the system is large but heterogenous. In particular, they are more valuable for high-ability individuals and individuals from higher parental backgrounds as these are better able to later exploit the possibilities that are opened up by switching to higher tracks at later stages of the system. We also find that, for individuals who face high expected returns to completing higher tracks but who start from a lower track, exercising second chance-options generally only partly offsets expected wage losses resulting from initially starting from a low track. Moreover, only a moderate fraction of such individuals later exercises second-chance options. Finally, we consider the role of the increasing use of second-chance options in the so-called “educational expansion” but find that initial placement to higher tracks was more important than increased flexibility in the form of second-chance options at later stages.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

In a stylized contractual choice problem we show that employers may have an incentive to offer performance-based contracts when match-specific productivity is high. We test the empirical content of this hypothesis using the NLSY79, which contains information about individual job histories and performance pay. We find that better match quality does affect pay arrangements, employment durations and wage cyclicality. Direct evidence on the accrual of job offers to workers lends support to the hypothesis that employers use performance-related compensation to preserve high-quality matches.","Compensation arrangements influence the evolution of workers’ wages. In this paper we present evidence that employers choose different pay arrangements depending on worker-job match quality and document how these choices have implications for wage dynamics and employment durations.====We begin by showing why compensation choices may depend on match quality and worker retention considerations. Within a simple stylized setting we illustrate how firms might have an incentive to retain workers in high quality matches by linking their pay to the performance (the production outcome) of the match.====To examine the empirical content of this hypothesis, we use detailed information from the NLSY79, including detailed questions about the form of compensation. This information allows us to characterize individual work histories and to distinguish between jobs with and without performance pay components. Our empirical analysis highlights a positive relationship between match quality and the prevalence of jobs featuring performance pay. This robust association is apparent whether or not one accounts for alternative dimensions of heterogeneity such as occupation and industry. We also find that match quality has a direct effect on wages after controlling for the adoption of performance pay. Thus, the quality of a match affects labor market returns above and beyond what is implied by contractual arrangements. Much ancillary evidence validates these findings and reinforces the view that job-specific productivity may play a central role for contractual choice and wage dynamics.====To identify the impact of match-specific quality on compensation choices we pursue several identification approaches. We use match quality proxies that reflect impact of labor market tightness on the outside options available to workers; these measures convey valuable information about the quality of persistent job matches. To corroborate our findings we also use direct evidence about the accrual of job offers while on the job. The latter delivers a transparent way to quantify the outside options available during each recorded working history and helps validate our baseline empirical findings.====In highlighting the relationship between pay arrangements and wage dynamics, we build on existing studies on the effects of compensation mechanisms on wages.==== For instance, Weitzman (1984) and Oyer (2004) argue that employers tie pay to firm performance in order to closely match compensation to their employees’ outside options. Our illustration of the contractual choice problem shows that this retention motive becomes more salient in the presence of match-specific heterogeneity, leading to interesting patterns of contractual sorting. The empirical analysis documents that job durations are significantly higher when performance-based pay is adopted and that wages in performance pay jobs exhibit sensitivity to cyclical conditions, while wages in jobs with no performance pay components do not. This is consistent with establishment-level evidence from the National Compensation Survey presented in Makridis and Gittleman (2020).====Crucially, the presence of a retention motive linked to match quality is consistent with the recurrent finding that performance pay jobs are more frequent at the upper end of the earnings distribution (see the survey-based evidence in Lemieux, Macleod, Parent, 2009, Lemieux, MacLeod, Parent, 2012, Makridis, 2014).====Heterogeneity of compensation arrangements is also found in large administrative data sets; for example, Grigsby et al. (2019) document state dependence in payroll measures of worker wage adjustments and show that variation in compensation schemes induces different degrees of flexibility. The observation that pay arrangements differ substantially across workers underpins our examination of the motives behind alternative compensation schemes offered by employers.====While existing studies do not consider the role of match quality for pay arrangements, they do suggest that provisions governing employment relationships may affect wage dynamics. Hence, in the process of examining the origins of contractual choices, our work contributes to the literature studying the impact of aggregate labor market conditions on wages. This line of research focuses on the cyclicality of workers’ pay and often uses the unemployment rate as a proxy for business cycle conditions.==== The idea that contracts play a role in determining the cyclicality of wages is not a new one==== and interest in these issues has been rekindled by the apparent changes, over recent decades, in the behavior of labor productivity and labor costs over the business cycle.==== Unlike previous research, we focus on the linkages between match-specific productivity and pay arrangements when considering the dynamics of wages. By explicitly studying the contract choice of a firm in the presence of heterogeneous match qualities, we follow the approach used in organization and personnel economics. This is convenient to discipline the empirical analysis and to convey a novel interpretation of the evidence.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The employer’s problem of choosing among compensation arrangements is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the empirical approach as well as the measurement of match quality and performance pay.

To answer this question I collect data on Mixed Martial Arts pomotions. I exploit the fact that one ,"The rise in income and wealth inequality over the last few decades has been heavily documented —see Piketty and Saez (2003), Atkinson et al. (2011) and more recently Alvaredo et al. (2017). An important feature of this rise is that it has been fast, especially in the United States. In a recent contribution, Gabaix et al. (2016) show that a standard random growth model is not able to replicate such a fast increase in top income inequality. Modifications of the random growth process to include ”superstar” effects help the model achieve a faster transition to a higher level of inequality. Another feature of the recent rise in income inequality is that it sparked an intense debate about potential ways to curb this fast rise in inequality. Most of the debates have centered around using taxes to achieve this goal —Piketty et al. (2014), Scheuer and Werning (2017).====The question that arises naturally is the following: if such policies to curb income inequality are going to be carried out, what are going to be their effects? If we consider markets for superstars, risk taking will be a relevant margin. Take entrepreneurs for example. Starting a business is a risky venture by itself, so we want to know whether higher top income or corporate tax rates will deter would-be entrepreneurs to take the first step.====Accordingly, the goal of this paper is to estimate the causal effect of a policy that compresses earnings inequality —especially at the top —on risk taking behavior in a market for superstars. Professional athletes leagues fit the description of a market for superstars in that a few talented athletes usually end up reaping most of the pecuniary rewards. I focus here on one type of sport in particular: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). There are two important reasons to do so. First, in contrast with sports such as football, baseball or basketball, there does not exist a particular league with an entrenched monopoly. In Mixed Martial Arts, there are basically two promotions that compete with one another: The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and Bellator. Second, in mid-July 2015, the UFC introduced a new earnings policy that had the effect to reduce earnings inequality, especially at the top: lower-tier fighters’ earnings increased modestly, while top earners took a heavy hit. In contrast, Bellator did not introduce any new policy during the same period.====To clarify the notion of risk-taking that I recover from the data, I lay out a simple model in which agents with different risk aversion have to choose between two actions: one with a stochastic payoff and one with known payoff. The model makes clear predictions regarding the share of agents that choose the risky (==== with stochastic payoff) action. A decrease in incomes at the top of the distribution should decrease the average amount of risk-taking. Moreover, the effect is likely to be different across agents. In particular, agents in the bottom of the income distribution should be mostly affected by their modest increase in income and should be relatively more willing to take on risk after the policy. I then collect a unique dataset to study these effects.====The dataset consists in fight outcomes over the period 2009 to early 2018. I run a standard Difference-in-Differences analysis to gauge the effects of the policy. I do not have access to data on ==== risk-taking during a given fight, so I use the way in which the fight ends (submission or (T)KO versus judges decision) as a proxy. I find that the probability that fights are finished before going to the judges decreases significantly for the treatment group after the policy. Moreover, the effect is economically significant: using my preferred specification, the 95% interval for the decrease in probability ranges from 10% to 26%. Under the hypothesis that increased risk taking most likely leads to a fight ending before going to the judges scorecards, this shows that the policy had the causal effect to decrease risk taking in this particular setup.====I also find evidence that this decrease is more pronounced for higher-earners. In particular, as predicted by the model, the effect is (i) strongest for higher-earners (ii) slightly dampened but still significant for the middle of the distribution and (iii) reversed for individuals at the low end of the distribution, although the latter is not statistically significant. Since these latter are not likely to be affected by the decrease in top income but rather by the modest increase in their (relatively low) income, the model predicts that they should be more willing to take on more risks.====A potential threat to identification is that the policy might have encouraged athletes from the UFC to migrate over to the competing promotion. If there were a large number of these, then the decrease in risk-taking observed might just be the result of top-talent leaving the UFC for Bellator. I find that this is most likely not the case. In my dataset I have very few athletes leaving the UFC for Bellator. Furthermore, some of these did not leave for Bellator in search of a better opportunity but were let go by the UFC and ended up in Bellator after. Finally, only one of the athletes that did migrate to Bellator ever held a UFC championship belt.====Another potential threat to identification is that the UFC introduced a new doping control policy alongside the sponsorship policy. As such, it could well be that the decrease in the probability of fights finishing before the distance is due to the fact that now fighters are more reluctant to use Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) and thus have subpar performances as a result. I gather data for the number of random controls per fighter/quarter after mid-2015 to control for this. What I find is that the stricter anti-doping policy actually had the ==== effect: fighters that have been controlled more times tend to exhibit ==== finishes via losses. This is the exact opposite of what is needed to explain the previous results. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the decrease in the proxy for risky strategies in the treatment group is mostly due to the sponsorship policy and its effect on expected earnings.====All in all, I find that this policy had a causal, overall negative effect on risk-taking. This begs for the following questions: what about external validity? Do we learn something useful from this particular setup? Since the market that I analyze is a market for superstars in which risk plays an important factor, it can be compared to entrepreneurship. Entry into entrepreneurship is a risky decision, but with potential rewards that can be very large for successful ones.

The average market has an HHI of 4,378, or the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting employers. 60% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2500 HHI). Highly concentrated markets account for 16% of employment. Labor market concentration is negatively correlated with wages, and there is no relationship between measured concentration and an occupation’s ====. These indicators suggest that employer concentration is a meaningful measure of employer power in labor markets, that there is a high degree of employer power in labor markets, and also that it varies widely across occupations and geography.","Monopsony power of employers in labor markets is not a new subject for labor economists, but prior work has generally focused on specific occupational markets thought to be specialized and therefore prone to employer power over a captive or semi-captive workforce (e.g. Matsudaira, 2013, Staiger, Spetz, Phibbs, 2010, and Ransom and Sims, 2010), or it has focused specifically on the low-wage labor market in the context of changes to the legislated minimum wage (e.g. Dube et al., 2010). In this article, we quantify the level of labor market concentration across nearly all occupations and for every commuting zone in the US, using the near-universe of online job vacancies for 2016 from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT). Based on findings in this and other work, we argue that concentration measured this way is a useful index of employers’ market power.====Calculating concentration in labor markets presupposes a market definition. In order to ascertain a rule of thumb for market definition in the labor context, we perform a hypothetical monopsonist test, analogous to the hypothetical monopolist test used for product market definition in the antitrust literature. The essence of such a test is to ask whether, for a given market definition, significant wage suppression would be profitable for an employer monopsonizing that market. The profitability of wage suppression depends on how many workers will leave in the face of wage suppression, i.e. the labor supply elasticity to the candidate market. In other words, conditional on other parameters of labor demand (firm productivity, output price, etc.), variation in the firm-level labor supply elasticity will generate variation in the monopsonistic wage markdown. Thus, we can make use of estimates of the labor supply elasticity corresponding to various market definitions to determine the right definition for our concentration calculations. Ultimately, we utilize as our main market definition a commuting zone-by 6-digit SOC occupation-by quarter market definition. We also present results for alternative market definitions.====The relationship between market definition, labor supply elasticity, and measured concentration of employers suggests that there is more than one way to measure employer market power. Azar et al. (2019b) show that higher market concentration is correlated with lower firm-specific labor supply elasticity, which is consistent with a theory of oligopsonistic labor markets in which employers compete for workers a la Cournot. It is intuitive that markets with fewer employers would result in fewer outside options for existing workers, and hence greater wage-setting power for incumbent firms. While in some models, firm-specific labor supply elasticity may be a more primitive parameter and market concentration of employers an equilibrium outcome, their close association in the data, in addition to the fact that concentration may be more readily measurable, creates a justification for both measuring concentration and using it as an index of market power.====Using the vacancy data from BGT, we calculate Herfindahl Hirschman Indices (HHIs) for labor markets at the occupation (6-digit SOC), commuting zone, and quarterly level. The average market has an HHI of 4378, which is the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting firms with equal shares of the total vacancy pool. 60% of markets have concentration greater than 2500. Note that a market with four firms and equal market shares has an HHI of 2,500, so an HHI of 2500 is the equivalent of 4 recruiting firms with equal shares of the total vacancy pool. Another 11% of markets have an HHI between 1500 and 2,500. In antitrust law, a market above 2500 HHI is highly concentrated and it is moderately concentrated between 1500 and 2500 HHI (Department of Justice / Federal Trade Commission 2010 horizontal merger guidelines). Under that definition, 60% of US markets are thus highly concentrated.====When we weight markets by BLS total employment, we find that 16 percent of workers work in highly concentrated labor markets, and a further 7 percent work in moderately concentrated markets. Concentration is lower in large commuting zones, which explains why weighting by employment lowers the prevalence of high concentration.====We also calculate concentration for a number of alternative market definitions in terms of occupation, location, and time. According to several plausible alternative market definitions, we find that at least 40% of markets are highly concentrated. We then perform several descriptive regressions of measured concentration on wages (using both BGT and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics data). We show a robust negative association between concentration and wages, using both occupation and commuting zone fixed effects and controlling for the demand state of the labor market. The negative association between concentration and wages is a sign that concentration is at least an indicator of employer market power.====Finally, we show that there is no robust relationship between concentration and several measures of occupational skill, signifying that labor markets are not more or less concentrated (given our market definition) for lower- or higher-skill jobs. From this work, at least, there’s no reason to believe that lower skill workers are any less subject to employers’ monopsony power, or vice versa.====Our measure of concentration is distinct from the industry concentration measures used by Autor et al. (2020), Barkai (2019), and other work purporting to show declining competition in the macroeconomy and sector-by-sector. Our measure is based on concentration in the labor market rather than concentration in the product market, and we make no claim about its long-term time trend given the available data. Our contribution is the first economy-wide measure of labor market concentration to have been made in many decades.====The papers that come closest to our approach include Azar et al. (2020), Benmelech et al. (2020), Qiu and Sojourner (2019), and Rinz (2018). Azar et al. (2020) examine the impact of concentration on wages but rely on only 17 occupations from one single job board, CareerBuilder.com. Due to these data limitations, that paper could not discuss and measure the sensitivity of concentration to alternative market definitions, or assess the overall level of concentration in the US. Benmelech et al. (2020) use Census data for manufacturing industries to measure employment concentration (as opposed to vacancy concentration) and its negative effect on wages. Rinz (2018) calculates labor market concentration by commuting zone and industry for the whole economy and investigates its impact on wage inequality. Benmelech et al. (2020) and Rinz (2018) focus on industries for defining labor markets, whereas we use six-digit SOC occupations.====In contrast to Benmelech et al. (2020), Qiu and Sojourner (2019) and Rinz (2018), we measure concentration using job openings rather than employment because we view vacancies as a better gauge of how likely searching workers (whether employed or unemployed) are to receive a job offer. Recent studies show that workers remain in jobs for longer.==== The corollary is that jobs are vacated less frequently, and so the concentration of employment may be a less relevant gauge of available work and employer market power than is the concentration of vacancies among the relatively few firms who are likely to be hiring at any given time. We further discuss this issue in Section 2.1. In theory, the wages for new hires are likely to be more flexible and sensitive to market conditions, be they macroeconomic fluctuations or changes in the degree of employer power, and so they offer a more variable indicator of the outcome of interest for tests of employer power. However, if vacancy-based concentration is a measure of employer power, it should also affect the wages of currently-employed workers. We use earnings from the Occupational Employment Statistics and show that our vacancy-based measure of concentration has essentially the same effect on the earnings of all workers as on the earnings posted by vacancies on BGT.====The previously-mentioned papers estimating a relationship between labor market concentration and wages or earnings may all suffer from identification problems (see Berry et al., 2019), although Benmelech et al. (2020) are able to control for employer characteristics that are usually considered to be the threats to identification in concentration-outcome regressions using market-level variation. But two recent papers, Arnold (2019) and Prager and Schmitt (2019), use observed mergers as plausibly exogenous variation in concentration unrelated to firm-specific characteristics or market demand parameters to identify a wage effect. Arnold (2019) does so for what is essentially the universe of mergers in the Longitudinal Business Database, while Prager and Schmitt (2019) focus on hospital mergers and workers in occupations employed by hospitals. Both find a significant negative effect of merger-induced concentration on wages, showing that increases in concentration are relevant to merger assessment, as discussed by Marinescu and Hovenkamp (2019).====Section 2 describes the Burning Glass data, Section 3 addresses market definition for labor markets, and Section 4 gives our estimates of labor market concentration. Section 4.1 correlates our labor market concentration estimates with vacancy- and market-level wages. Section 4.2 relates those concentration estimates to other occupation-level variables, to ascertain whether employer market power differs systematically across observable characteristics of occupations. Section 5 places our results in the larger debate over inter-firm inequality and employer power in labor markets, and Section 6 concludes.",Concentration in US labor markets: Evidence from online vacancy data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300907,18 July 2020,2020,Research Article,260.0

We test for statistical discrimination against female instructors using the employer learning model in which the instructor value-added to the grades of the current course and follow-on course is used to measure teaching effectiveness. The results show that statistical discrimination is a significant source of gender bias in teaching evaluations, especially among male students and in STEM departments where female faculty is underrepresented. Gender bias in teaching evaluations was reduced by nearly 50% after ten years of teaching. The results also suggest that the gender gap in teaching evaluations changes over time as male and female students evaluate male and female instructors differentially. Statistical discrimination is closely related to the underrepresentation of women in ====. For female students, the gender gap in evaluation scores narrows when the share of female faculty in the department rises. By contrast, male students are less sensitive to the percentage of female faculty in the department.","We have seen considerable advances in women's education in recent years (DiPrete and Buchmann, 2013; Goldin et al., 2006). Women's earnings in the U.S. climbed from 60% of men's earnings to over 80% between 1980 and 2014 (Blau and Kahn, 2017). Despite the improvement in women's human capital, the gender wage gap remains large and has been attributed to discrimination, occupation segregation, and combination of both (Petersen and Morgan 1995; Altonji and Blank 1999; Bertrand and Hallock 2001; Bertrand et al., 2010; Cardoso et al., 2016).====Women are underrepresented in academia and their progress in pursuing an academic career has been slow. In 2015, 35% of new PhDs, 28% of assistant professors, 24% of associate professors, and 12% of full professors in economics in the U.S. were female (McElroy, 2016). Only 32% of entering economic Ph.D. students in the U.S. are female (Boustan and Langan, 2019). At the same time, female scientists are less likely to get tenure, are viewed as less competent, and receive lower pay and research funding (Boustan and Langan, 2019; Ellemers, 2014; Van der Lee and Ellemers, 2015; Kaatz et al., 2014; Shen, 2013; Valian, 1999).====Universities have increasingly relied on student evaluations of teaching (SET) as a measure of teaching performance in hiring and promotion decisions. However, SET reflects students' subjective assessment of teaching quality, which can potentially be influenced by prejudice, stereotypes, or misperceptions of women's ability to perform tasks, especially in male-dominated fields. Studies have shown that students characterize female instructors as being warm, nurturing, more like teachers than professors, while male instructors are perceived as more knowledgeable and being able to contribute to students' intellectual development (Bennett, 1982; Heilman and Okimoto, 2007; Young et al., 2009; Boring, 2017). Biased feedback misleads female instructors to allocate more resources toward teaching that further reduces the time for research. Gender bias in SET constitutes a form of inequality that adversely affects the career advances of female instructors.====The literature has shown that SET is biased against women (Bray and Howard, 1980; Basow and Silberg, 1987; Basow, 1995; Miller and Chamberlin, 2000; Potvin et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2016; Boring, 2017; Mengel et al., 2019). Buser et al. (2019) find that gender bias in SET changes throughout the semester as students respond to feedback from male and female instructors differently. However, the mechanisms leading to the bias and shaping the dynamics of the evaluation scores remain unclear and deserve further investigation. One source of gender bias originates from taste- or prejudice-based discrimination, while the alternative mechanism is statistical discrimination that arises when female instructors are underrepresented. Students rely on stereotypes when assessing teaching effectiveness because they lack information on the actual productivity of female instructors.====Studies of the role model effect show that low representation of female faculty discourages female students from pursuing a career in the field. The share of women on faculty is positively related to the share of female Ph.D. students in the department (Boustan and Langan, 2019). Female students perform better in STEM classes and are more likely to take advanced STEM courses when their introductory level professors are females (Bettinger and Long, 2005; Dee, 2005; Holmlund and Sund, 2008; Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, 2009; Porter and Serra, 2020).====This paper goes beyond the findings in earlier studies to disentangle the mechanisms through which the gender bias in SET arises using administrative data from the National University of Kaohsiung (NUK). We adopt the employer learning model to test for statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973; Lundberg and Startz, 1983; Altonji and Blank, 1999; Pinkston, 2003; Altonji and Pierret, 2001). To our knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to present evidence of statistical discrimination in SET and address the dynamics of evaluation scores for male and female instructors.==== We identify gender bias in SET by exploiting the institutional setting in which students are required to take the required courses in the department. This unique feature mitigates the problem of self-selection into classes that have plagued some earlier studies.====The employer learning model predicts that the effect of instructor gender on teaching evaluations diminishes with experience, while the impact of teaching effectiveness on evaluation scores rises with experience. Students learn an instructor's teaching effectiveness over time via class participation, word of mouth, and the instructor's reputation. Following Chetty et al. (2014) and Kane and Staiger (2008), we construct time-varying VA (value-added) to the ==== as the benchmark measure of teaching effectiveness. More importantly, we propose time-varying VA to ==== to mitigate the concern over the potential endogeneity in our benchmark VA that occurs when instructors strategically inflate the current course grades to improve the evaluation SET scores (Sabot and Wakeman-Linn, 1991; Anglin and Meng, 2000; Achen and Courant, 2009; Bar et al., 2009; Li and Zafar, 2020).====This study makes two key contributions to the literature. First, little is known for the role of statistical discrimination in gender bias in SET. We fill the gap by decomposing the gender bias into sources driven by taste-based and statistical discrimination when the endogeneity of VA is considered simultaneously. The results show the extent to which improvements in faculty gender ratio alleviate gender bias in teaching evaluations. The paper also investigates the dynamics of SET scores by showing that male and female instructors are evaluated differentially by students over time. The analyses shed new lights for institutions to recognize the gender gap in SET and improve teaching evaluations that have failed to reflect such differences across faculty genders.====Second, although recent studies use random assignment to instructors to identify the causal effect (Kang, 2007; Carrell and West, 2010; Eisenkopf et al., 2015; MacNell et al., 2015; Boring, 2017; Mengel et al., 2019), the evidence mainly comes from the U.S. and Europe. Generalization of their results is limited because random assignments are either confined to a small number of courses or implemented in one college. Instructor backgrounds are also quite heterogeneous, including full-time and part-time professors, lecturers, professionals, Ph.D., and non-PhD students. Gender bias in SET may reflect differences in academic training across instructors. By contrast, our data consist of courses from all departments between 2002 and 2015. Moreover, all full-time instructors have a Ph.D. degree, which substantially reduces the impact of instructors' academic qualifications on SET.====Table 1 provides a snapshot of the relationship between the gender gap in SET and the share of male instructors (students) in the department.==== The gender gap widens as the department becomes more male-dominated in both faculty and students. A ten percentage point increase in the share of male instructors (students) increases the gender gap in SET by 0.02 (0.03), a 31% (36%) jump from the sample mean. The results demonstrate that the underrepresentation of female faculty is positively related to the gender bias in SET.====Fig. 1 shows potential evidence of stereotyping and statistical discrimination against female faculty that highlights the extent to which information of academic reputation affects SET scores. We study changes in SET scores six semesters before and after the tenure promotion by instructor gender. Zero value on the horizontal axis indicates the time of promotion. The evaluation scores of male instructors are similar throughout the period. Nonetheless, the evaluation scores received by female instructors surge right after the promotion and surpass the scores of male counterparts. Tenure promotion, an advance in academic reputation, may change how students evaluate the academic qualifications of female instructors. In other words, new information on women's productivity can lead to stereotype change.====The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the literature review. Section III discusses the data and the construction of variables. Sections IV and V layout the empirical models and present the results, respectively.

Graduating students in treatment schools were surveyed and given information on the labor market prospects associated with detailed post-secondary programs. We find that students who were the most likely to update their beliefs due to the intervention started to apply to programs associated with higher earnings. However, this subgroup is too small to give rise to a statistically or economically significant impact on the overall application or enrollment patterns.","The choice of how long and what to study is among the most important investment decisions that a typical person makes during her lifetime. Thus it is not surprising that many policy makers, commentators and parents worry about students’ ability to make the ”right” choices. Indeed, there appears to be widespread concern that many students lack information about the economic consequences of their educational choices and thus do not acquire the type of skills for which there is demand in the labor market. Many governments have responded to these concerns by running schemes that aim to improve the information available to students.====In this paper, we argue that while information interventions can yield substantial belief updating—and may affect some students’ behavior—they may have a limited impact on the allocation of students into post-secondary programs. We reach this conclusion with the help of a large randomized field experiment that provided Finnish high school students accurate information about the earnings distributions, employment rates, and the most common occupations associated with detailed post-secondary educational degrees. After receiving this information, roughly a third of the treatment group students report to have updated their beliefs. Furthermore, the intervention pushed students who were the most likely to hold unrealistically positive expectations on the labor market prospects of their preferred programs to apply to programs associated with higher earnings. However, this group of affected students appears to be small. Thus we fail to find a statistically or economically significant impacts on the overall application or enrollment patterns.====Our experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the match between educational choices and the demand for skills in the labor market can be enhanced by providing information on the population outcomes associated with alternative degrees. This hypothesis is based on earlier work showing that information interventions can have large effects on the likelihood of continuing in secondary education in developing countries (Jensen, 2010, Nguyen) and that they affect students’ beliefs and intentions in developed countries (Baker, Bettinger, Jacob, Marinescu, 2018, McGuigan, McNally, Wyness, 2016, Oreopoulos, Dunn, 2013, Peter, Zambre, 2017, Wiswall, Zafar, 2015). However, evidence on the effect of providing information on labor market prospects on ==== educational choices remains scarce.====In our experiment, we contacted student guidance counselors working in 97 randomly chosen Finnish high schools and offered them an information package and related lecture materials. In the 64 high schools that chose to participate, more than 5000 students sat through an obligatory class given as a part of their standard curriculum. During the class, students listened to a student guidance counselor’s presentation on the differences in the distribution of earnings and employment rates between different post-secondary degrees. They also completed a survey where they were asked about their preferences and expectations. Along with the survey, the students were given a leaflet reporting the distribution of earnings, employment rates, and the most common occupations among the current population of 30–34-year-old persons by 104 most common post-secondary degrees. Furthermore, they were given the supplementary material at the end of the class to consult at home. The experiment was implemented 5–6 months before the students applied to post-secondary programs.====The Finnish higher education system provides a particularly informative setting for our experiment, because students apply directly to degree programs (including professional degrees such as medicine and law). Thus, the choices that we observe at the admission stage are closely connected with the education that the students will have when they enter the labor market. The universities choose their students based on transparent and uniform criteria based solely on the credits derived from the national final high school exam and the university’s own entrance examination. The importance of the entry exams—which are typically based on material not covered in high school—means that the students participating in our intervention have not yet critically limited their choice set of post-secondary degrees. In particular, pre-intervention grades or any other kind of assessment by their high school teachers are not used as admission criteria. Furthermore, credit constraints are unlikely to complicate our analysis because Finnish universities do not charge tuition fees, and the government offers generous subsidies to students who gain entry to higher education. In short, we examine the impacts of the intervention on the relevant educational choices in a transparent, flexible, and simple setting.====The choice of field of study is likely to have important implications for earnings and employment outcomes in the Finnish context. The differences in average earnings across graduates from different fields are nearly as large in Finland as the differences reported by Altonji et al. (2012) for the United States. Even though we are unable to provide the treatment school students with personalized estimates of their individual returns to education in different fields, we argue that providing them information on the earnings distribution by fields can help them form more accurate estimates of their potential earnings. Furthermore, our subsample and survey results suggest that the control group was unlikely to receive similar information through other channels. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that such information was not publicly available but had to be acquired from Statistics Finland with significant financial and effort costs.====Another major advantage of the Finnish context is that we can use the national application registry to evaluate the intervention’s impact. These data cover all applications to Finnish universities and polytechnics over several years and allow us to study the effects separately on applications and final enrollments and to check for the robustness of our results when controlling for the baseline educational choices at the school level. Access to register data also means that we avoid attrition problems and obtain high statistical power. Furthermore, we do not need to convince the control schools to participate without receiving any of the potential benefits. However, these gains come with the inevitable cost of not obtaining survey data for the control group.====Our experimental results show that, on average, the information intervention did not affect the likelihood of being enrolled in a post-secondary program or the type of programs where the students were enrolled. Furthermore, the application patterns among students graduating from the treatment and control school are indistinguishable. The point estimates are close to zero and sufficiently precise to rule out economically significant effects.====To understand why the intervention had little average impact, we turn to the survey data collected as part of the experiment. The results show that while students value many dimensions of alternative degrees, four-fifths report that future earnings are an important factor in their educational choice. Importantly, these data reveal similar belief updating as has been documented in the previous literature cited above. Roughly a third of the respondents in our survey declared that they were surprised about the labor market prospects associated with the program to which they intended to apply, and approximately 19% state that these prospects were worse than they had expected. Moreover, among the students who allowed us to link their survey answers to the application register, we find that this belief updating was correlated with their later choices: those who had been negatively surprised were more likely to change the field that they actually applied to than the rest of the treatment school students. We interpret these findings as evidence of the intervention conveying information to the students.====The correlation between being negatively surprised and changing plans later in our survey data also suggests that the intervention may have affected the behavior of the subgroup of students who were disappointed about the labor market prospects of their intended field. Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare surprised students in the treatment group with those in the control group who would have been surprised if they had received the information intervention. Instead, we take an indirect approach using the linked survey-register data. Using information available in the application register for the full student population—demographics, subjects taken in the national matriculation exam, and school characteristics—we predict the likelihood of being negatively surprised about earnings in the first program of choice. We then estimate the treatment effects for subgroups that differ in this predicted likelihood. The results suggest that the students who were most likely to be negatively surprised started to apply to programs associated with higher earnings. However, this subgroup is too small to affect the average treatment effect estimates significantly.====These results add to the growing literature evaluating interventions designed to improve the efficiency of educational choice. In addition to the papers cited above, existing work closest to our own is Hastings et al. (2015), who provided information about costs and returns associated with different degrees using an online tool incorporated into the student aid application procedure in Chile. They find that the intervention decreased demand for low-return degrees—typically provided by for-profit institutions—among low-SES, low-achieving students. In contrast, there appears to be little or no effect for high-SES students. This suggests that the difference in the average effect of their study, in comparison to ours, is likely driven by differences in the distribution of students background and the supply of higher education rather the specific form of the interventions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following two sections, we describe the institutional context and the information intervention. We then discuss the findings from the survey conducted among the students in our treatment schools. The fifth section discusses the applications register and our estimation methods and reports the results.

Our empirical strategy combines difference-in-difference designs with synthetic control groups to analyse transitions of workers between unemployment, regular employment and employment accompanied by welfare receipt. Working makes people generally better off than being unemployed but employed welfare recipients do not reach the life satisfaction level of regular employees. This implies that welfare receipt entails non-compliance with the norm to make one's own living. Our findings allow us to draw cautious conclusions on employment subsidies paid as welfare benefits.","Income increases people's consumption opportunities, irrespective of its source, and thus raises individual welfare. We question this implicit assumption made in economics and argue that the source of income does matter for individual well-being, at least for those employed workers who receive supplementary ====, i.e. in-work benefits. They may suffer from being dependent on public income support rather than being able to make their own living.====; ====; ====). It worsens perceived social status, causes people to violate the social norm to work and leads to a deterioration in self-esteem, or identity utility (cf. ====; ====; ====). Additional jobs for unemployed workers, created in this way, ====, help them to restore their social identity as they allow them to comply with the norm to work. These policies should thus raise the life satisfaction of the beneficiaries. It is an unsettled question, however, whether such policy tools allow subsidized workers to fully recover from unemployment. This will only be the case if the subsidy does not affect subjective well-being beyond its income effect. When workers’ social identity not only depends on being employed, but also on adhering to the norm of making a living by one's own efforts (====), which we term the non-dependency norm, an employment subsidy shaped as income support will not suffice to completely remove the misery of the unemployed. Workers who receive public income support may realize that they live off public assistance instead of making their own living. As a result, they may be less satisfied with their lives than non-subsidized (in the following also ‘regularly’) employed workers.====In this study, we assess the role of such a non-dependency norm for employees’ well-being by analysing the well-being effects of subsidized employment in the form of in-work benefits compared to unemployment and regular employment. We examine the well-being of working UB II recipients in Germany, using data of the ====We find that people become better off when they leave unemployment and start to work while continuing to receive welfare, and that this cannot be solely explained by the associated rise in available income. Employed people, however, who leave income support and become regularly employed also experience an increase in life satisfaction, even when controlling for income changes. As these people enjoy all the benefits of employment before and after the change, such as adhering to the work norm, this second finding points to a negative impact of receiving income support. This result is in line with the hypothesis that in-work benefits prevent the beneficiaries from complying with the non-dependency norm.====We proceed as follows: ==== reviews the previous literature on in-work benefits and relates our contribution to it.

We examine changes to the wage structure in the UK and Germany, two countries with apparently very different trends. Using panel data, we argue that changes to quality-adjusted prices for occupations grouped by predominant tasks correlate strongly with employment growth in both countries, consistently with task-based changes to ====. The gap between price and average wage changes is strongest in top (knowledge) jobs, implying that the average quality of these workers has declined over time. We obtain further direct evidence on changes to worker quality using rich data on individual characteristics.","Across most developed economies, the occupational structure has shifted substantially over at least the last 30 years. This shift has typically seen employment decline in middle-earning occupations, and grow in jobs at the top of the wage distribution. Employment has also grown, to a lesser extent, in low-paying jobs, giving rise to a pattern of ‘polarization’.==== This noticeable polarization has been attributed to a number of causes, such as changes to patterns of trade or to the task requirements in production. Testing the causes of polarization at even the most basic level requires examining the equilibrium movement across sectors of both employment and labour returns. Yet, although the patterns of employment changes are clear, the evidence on wages is harder to interpret. Exactly because of the large changes to employment, average wages observed across sectors are likely driven by composition effects. Intuitively, if employment in a sector grows, it is likely that new entrants are of different average quality to the incumbents. It is therefore important to look beyond average wages, and to identify the pure (selection- or composition-free) prices on labour. This distinction between average wages and the price on labour has long been made by labour economists. Within the polarization literature this distinction has recently been emphasized by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Gottschalk et al. (2016) among others.====In this paper we make two contributions. First we estimate underlying prices of broad occupational groups using panel data for two important economies: the UK and Germany. In both countries we find that these prices deviate significantly from observed average wages. Importantly, in both countries, we find that price changes are noticeably positively associated with employment growth across sectors. Meanwhile if we compare employment changes not with prices but with changes to average wages, this association disappears. Overall, our evidence is consistent with occupational shifts being caused by changes in the demand for different types of labour, such as by changes to technology. Our evidence also therefore highlights the importance of identifying underlying prices when considering hypotheses about the labour market. Ours is the first paper to provide consistent evidence across countries on these task price movements.====A corollary of these results is that the average quality of workers across different sectors has changed substantially over time. Our second contribution, therefore, is to demonstrate these changes by providing additional evidence that goes beyond wage data. Specifically we examine two markers of individual productivity: cognitive ability scores and height. Both these markers are strongly correlated with labour market outcomes. While cognitive ability is possibly a closer and more obvious indicator of productive skills, height is extremely useful for the present application: it is highly stable within individuals over time; comparable across surveys, and, compared to cognitive scores, less sector-specific. Using both measures, and consistent with the evidence from wage data, we find evidence of changes in composition. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to provide explicit evidence of changing sorting over time based on individual measures of worker quality in this context.====In common with much of the literature, we group broad occupations according to their predominant task. Specifically we divide jobs into four categories, depending on whether or not the occupation is predominantly intensive in cognitive versus manual tasks along one axis, and whether or not it is highly routine along the other. In both countries, we see most prominently a rapid increase in cognitive and non-routine (‘abstract’) employment. We also see a decline in middle-earning routine-manual occupations among males. Correspondingly, in both countries we see a striking increase in the relative price on abstract labour, not matched by changes in observed wages. An implication of these results from wage data is that it is the average quality of workers in abstract occupations that has declined most strongly over time. Our results are robust to allocating jobs to tasks not by broad occupation but at a finer level of detail.====To study wages, we use data from the British Household Panel Survey over 1991–2008, and from the German Socio-Economic Panel over 1985–2013. These periods are noteworthy because they feature particularly large changes in occupational composition. To estimate the task prices we use a standard wage model, in which a worker is endowed with differing productivities across sectors, and therefore makes occupational choices given aggregate prices and unobservable individual-specific returns. The model nests, and follows the logic of, a standard Roy framework. The model also allows for frictions, such as costs of switching occupations or jobs. As is standard, by using the panel data structure we net out the time-invariant unobservable components and provide estimates of the prices that are free of selection effects. Our approach follows that used by Cortes (2016) to study task prices in the US, as well as other studies in related settings.====Our analysis of price changes has three main strengths. First, we go beyond Cortes (2016) in providing robust support for the empirical evidence, by introducing extensive controls for observable characteristics. Second, we extend the analysis to look at prices at a finer level of occupational aggregation. We find that patterns of employment and prices at this finer detail can be easily reconciled. Finally, by using a consistent occupational classification, we provide coherent evidence across countries. As is shown later, the UK and Germany experienced job polarization to differing degrees: our evidence provides a unified and coherent explanation of the movements of task prices and employment across both countries combined.====We supplement our results with direct evidence of changes in worker quality in both countries across sectors. For the UK we augment our data with especially rich information on personal characteristics available in around 2010 from the Understanding Society survey. Despite the rich information available in both countries, data limitations require us to adapt our framework somewhat. To use the data to their fullest, we focus our analysis not on occupation but on education. Our favoured analysis shows that the average height of males with a degree has declined relative to those without a degree. To support this analysis, we show that in both countries degree holding has been a stable proxy for working in the abstract sector. Overall, we infer from our results that the quality of ‘knowledge workers’ has declined over time.====Using the UK’s rich data, we validate this result in several ways. First we use the cognitive ability test scores, also collected in 2010. In a related way to heights, we argue that the average cognitive score of degree holders has declined, relative to non-degree holders, over time. However, although cognitive ability is arguably a more direct measure of worker skills than height, it is sector-specific, less stable over time and less easy to compare across surveys. For these reasons, and because appropriate comparable data for Germany are sparse, we use the analysis of cognitive ability as supportive evidence. Second, we combine our main data source on heights, which was collected around 2005 and 2010, with an additional set of measures taken in 1991, from the UK’s National Child Development Survey, to provide a repeated cross-section. Our results using education are confirmed. Most importantly, we show that height patterns are similar when we define sectors by occupation, although the sample sizes used here are smaller, and consequently estimates are less precise. Overall, we provide evidence of changes in quality compositions that is strong and robust.====Our paper relates most closely to recent papers which estimate prices on tasks using panel data. Besides Cortes (2016), Yamaguchi (2018) also uses data from the PSID and controls for unobserved skills by conditioning on full labour market histories. In ongoing work, Böhm et al. (2019) use administrative panel data from Germany, and build a rich structural framework with which they identify not only task price movements but also life-cycle skill formation. They identify both components simultaneously by partitioning their long panel and exploiting time variation in the underlying changes to labour demand. Relative to their work, our work provides cross-country evidence and explores individual characteristics. In terms of substantive results, it is reassuring that Böhm et al.’s findings on task price movements are similar to ours and also show a substantial divergence from observed average wages.====In addition to the papers using panel data, further papers employ contrasting approaches using repeated cross-sections. Of these, Gottschalk et al. (2016) use data on new entrants to the labour market from the US Current Population Survey. They estimate bounds on prices, taking into account selection effects, by trimming the observed wage distributions. Second, Böhm (2020) addresses selection into sectors using a ‘propensity index’ method. He uses data on ability scores in the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to model occupational choice. The main problem with both approaches is that it is difficult to control successfully for changing characteristics of successive cohorts. In particular, not only has the employment structure in the US shifted, but so has the composition of educational attainment. In our context, and as discussed in both countries, degree holding and occupational attainment have increased in parallel. By tracking the same workers over time, the panel-data approach used here by-passes issues surrounding educational composition completely.====More generally, our paper relates to the large literature on job polarization, recently discussed in Autor (2015). Of particular relevance is Salvatori (2015), who examines the UK, Dustmann et al. (2009) and Antonczyk et al. (2009), who discuss Germany, while Beaudry et al. (2016) address somewhat contrasting patterns in the US in the 2000s. Our paper also relates to important literatures on the evolution of inequality in the UK, and particularly in Germany. In addition to Dustmann et al. (2009), Card et al. (2013) emphasize the increased sorting of workers in Germany across establishments. Finally, our paper relates to the literature on labour market returns to individual characteristics. Perhaps most notable are Heckman et al. (2006) on cognitive and other abilities, and Case and Paxson (2008) and Persico et al. (2004) on height.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Starting with the class of 2015, the state of Tennessee has been covering full tuition and fees for any high school graduate who wishes to attend a state-funded two-year college under its unique Tennessee Promise initiative. Exploiting the timing of this policy shock, we employ quasi-experimental methods to document that Tennessee Promise increased full-time first-time undergraduate enrollment at the state's community colleges by at least 40%. We also find a positive response in attendance among black and Hispanic students. An auxiliary analysis shows a short-run reduction of about 2% in enrollment at the state's public four-year institutions, suggesting some degree of substitutability between the unsubsidized and subsidized college sectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future statewide free-college programs.","It is well known that price is an important determinant of an individual's demand for higher education. Due to the ever-increasing costs of acquiring a traditional bachelor's degree, attending a state community college either to complete a terminal postsecondary degree or to later transfer to a four-year institution remains an attractive and popular route for many high school graduates in the United States. For most, however, community college education is not free. At present, most students, except those in the lowest income percentiles, are expected to incur some out-of-pocket college expenses.====The escalation of tuition and fees in recent decades has encouraged Tennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota to initiate plans to reverse this trend and provide free community college education across the board. Statewide tuition assistance policies have been designed to mitigate the cost pressures, increase college-going rates, and, ultimately, foster future regional economic activity.====Tennessee, in particular, instituted the “Drive to 55” campaign in 2013 under Governor Haslam with an ambitious mission of bringing the share of Tennesseans possessing a college degree or certificate up to 55% by 2025. One prominent piece of “Drive to 55” is the Tennessee Promise program, which entails the coverage of tuition ==== fees for high school graduates attending the state's two-year colleges. Conditional on several eligibility criteria, none of which is related to need or merit, high school students beginning with the graduating class of 2015 can now attend the state's two-year colleges at no cost via the ""last-dollar"" scholarship formula, whereby the parts of tuition fees not met by other federal and state aid programs are covered.====In this study, we examine the enrollment impacts of Tennessee's novel program. Following Cornwell et al. (2006), we shift the focus away from individual student outcomes and instead look at enrollment changes at the institution level. This analysis warrants attention, since statewide free-college programs like Tennessee Promise are large, and given that they target the entire population of high school students in the state as opposed to the marginal, highest-performing, or lowest-performing students, the intended effects of these programs are expected to be more general than what local estimates would indicate. In addition to appealing to state committees, our study is of interest to both researchers and college-level policymakers.====While our main focus is on two-year institutions, we also conduct an auxiliary analysis on enrollment substitutability. The motivation is that if publicly funded programs like Tennessee Promise provide a truly credible signal, then we might expect a change in college preferences among high school seniors, which in turn might alter enrollment patterns at the state's four-year institutions, at least in the short run. This conjecture is at least descriptively corroborated by a notable fall in enrollment at branch campuses of the University of Tennessee, including the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and the University of Tennessee at Martin, which was observed immediately following the inception of the Tennessee Promise program.====Exploiting the timing of Tennessee's policy action, we employ quasi-experimental designs with the classic difference-in-differences (DID henceforth) estimator and the new generalized synthetic control (GSC henceforth) estimator to quantify the treatment effects, with the latter approach being robust to a potential violation of the common-trends assumption. Our results indicate that the Tennessee Promise program has had a notable enrollment impact on the state's two-year institutions since its enactment. The analysis also reveals a significant increase in attendance among black and Hispanic students and some degree of enrollment substitutability across colleges in the short run.====Our study contributes to both academic and policy discourse in meaningful ways. Whereas community colleges play a significant role in the US postsecondary education system, previous research has largely focused on the impact of financial support on college outcomes among four-year institutions. By investigating a recent universal tuition-free policy within the two-year sector, we add new results to the expansive higher education funding literature and the modest yet fast-growing literature on college promise programs.====Given the ongoing discussions on the concept of “free college” at the national level, our results for a statewide program like Tennessee Promise are timely and policy-relevant. As of March 2018, 16 states had at least one statewide free-college variant. Among these 16, 10 states had executed both enactment and funding, with eight enacting the program in 2017 alone.==== It is predicted that Tennessee's action will provide lessons for other states to follow in the future. To this end, we highlight the most important similarities and differences between Tennessee Promise and other aid programs, including smaller-scale, residency-based projects as well as HOPE-style initiatives, to shed light on the future design of statewide free-college policies.",Free college?

Labour force participation measures the amount of labour available for production in a country. As it directly influences the potential growth of the economy, it is a key indicator of the health of the labour market.====Labour force participation received renewed attention during the Great Recession, when participation rates varied widely across OECD countries.==== Interestingly, while the unemployment rate increased almost everywhere, the evolution of participation rates diverged widely between Europe and the US. In the US, the labour force participation rate of prime-age adults declined by 2 p.p. between 2007 and 2013. In contrast, in the EU15, participation increased by 2 p.p. over the same period despite growing unemployment.==== This increase in participation in Europe was almost entirely concentrated among females. Whereas in the US, the participation rate of prime age women decreased by 1.4 p.p. from 2007–2013, it increased by 8 p.p. in Spain, by 5 p.p. in Greece and by between 4 and 2 p.p. in Portugal, Austria, Italy and the UK, despite these economies plunging into a severe recession.====We investigate in this paper what explains this rapid and spectacular evolution of participation rates in Europe during the Great Recession. While many studies document how changes in social norms and attitudes starting long before the Great Recession contributed to increasing the participation of women (see e.g. Bertrand et al., 2020, or Fernández, 2013), our paper highlights the contribution of gender-specific shifts in labour demand during the Great Recession. We report that the decline in labour demand during the Great Recession appears to have been much more unfavourable to men relative to women in Europe compared with the US. As a consequence, we document that changes in relative labour demand can explain a large share of the increase in participation of women during that period, in particular in the countries most affected by the recession.====Using individual-level data from ten European countries, we first document that as in the US (Foote and Ryan, 2015; Jaimovich and Siu, 2012), job polarization (which denotes the reallocation of employment towards the lowest- and highest-paying occupations) continued to increase during the Great Recession in Europe as the share of jobs in middle-paid occupations in total employment declined rapidly in the most affected countries. However, a key difference from the US is that even today men and women remain much more segregated by gender across occupations in Europe and that these higher segregation levels declined neither in recent decades nor during the Great Recession. In particular, as of 2013, middle-paid routine jobs, which were strongly affected by the recession, remained 20% more likely to employ male workers in Europe than in the US. In contrast, low- and high-paid occupations, which were much less affected by the recession, employed a much larger share of female workers. Thus, these figures suggest that the large destruction of middle-skill jobs produced a much more dramatic decline in the labour market opportunities of men in Europe than those in the US, whereas the fact that the lowest- and highest-paying occupations were less affected was more favourable to women.====To quantify how much these differences in labour demand shocks by gender influenced the decision of women to join the labour market and explain their increase in participation during the Great Recession, we follow recent work and adopt a local labour market strategy.==== Specifically, we relate regional changes in labour force participation by gender to local changes in male and female employment. However, changes in employment by gender are endogenous, as they are influenced not only by labour demand shocks but also by labour supply and participation decisions. To isolate labour demand shocks, we construct two shift-share or Bartik instrumental variables specific to each gender. The logic of these widely used instruments is that, to some extent, the shock of the Great Recession varied by gender across regions because of the initial gendered differences in the composition of employment across occupations. These instruments are valid if the predicted labour demand shocks are unrelated to local unobserved factors influencing labour supply.====An important but often neglected issue is that these large demand shocks should also influence the mobility of households across regions (Amior and Manning, 2018; Blanchard and Katz, 1992). Using a simple Roy model with endogenous location choice and participation decisions, we highlight that the mobility responses of households to gender-specific demand shocks should bias upward the coefficients capturing the effects on participation of female labour demand shocks.====To address these issues, our main estimates exploit within-individual changes in participation during the Great Recession from panel data that we aggregate at the regional level. This implies that in contrast to estimates that use data from repeated cross-sections as in most of the literature, our estimates are not affected by endogenous changes in the observed or unobserved characteristics of the population across regions in response to labour demand shocks. The fact that regional changes in participation are obtained from within-individual variation also implies that our results are not explained by cross-cohort differences in attitudes towards the participation of women in the labour market.====The empirical results confirm that it is important to distinguish demand shocks by gender to understand the increase in participation of women during the Great Recession. First, we find that during the Great Recession, the participation of married women countercyclically increased in response to the decline in labour demand for occupations more likely to employ men. Second, the participation of women also responded to local demand shocks to female labour demand. Women were much more likely to participate in the labour market in regions that experienced less decline in demand for jobs more likely to employ women.====Across countries, the fit of the model is rather good because these regional-level shocks can account for most of the aggregate increase in participation of prime age married women during the Great Recession in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK and Finland in our sample. An important exception is Austria, where the model does not predict the observed increase in participation.====When estimating similar models for men, we find that although negative demand shocks to occupations dominated by men are strong predictors of increases in their unemployment rates, these shocks explain little of the decline in male participation during the Great Recession.====Adjusting for changes in the composition of the population across regions over this period also appears important, as we estimate that the population changes rapidly in response to labour demand shocks. In particular, the share of women with higher education levels increased rapidly in regions that experienced positive demand shocks for jobs more likely to employ women. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, these changes in the composition of the regional population tend to bias cross-sectional estimates that use observed changes in participation. In particular, we obtain a much lower coefficient for the effect of male labour demand shocks and a coefficient that is twice as large for female labour demand shocks when we do not use within-individual variation to calculate aggregate changes in regional participation rates.====One concern with empirical work based on shift-share or Bartik instruments is that the results might be driven by persistent trends across regions (Jaeger et al., 2018). To assess the relevance of this concern, we perform placebo regressions that test whether the demand shocks of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2013 that we use to estimate our model can explain earlier changes in participation from 2000 to 2006. We find little correlation between future shocks to labour demand for women and previous changes in female participation. We also show that our main results are robust to including past shocks in our baseline regression. In addition, when we extend the sample to include the decade before the Great Recession, our main results are robust to controlling for country- or region-specific trends.====This paper builds on and contributes to several strands of literature. First, we extend and update the literature on gender segregation in the labour market in Europe by examining its recent evolution in the context of job polarization and the Great Recession.==== We underline the persistence over that period of high levels of segregation relative to the US despite the important reallocations of employment across occupations.====Second, we highlight that taking into account these higher levels of gender segregation across occupations in Europe helps to explain the evolution of labour force participation of women in Europe during the Great Recession. While some country-specific studies have emphasized the large countercyclical increase of the labour force participation of women in Europe during the Great Recession====, our study offers evidence from harmonized European panel data that allows for clear cross-country comparisons. Using harmonized cross-country data allows us to quantify the importance of labour demand shocks in the evolution of participation by gender across countries during the Great Recession, complementing existing studies, which have mostly focused on the US.====Third, our paper emphasizes the importance of the response of the population to large labour market shocks. Our estimates indicate substantial changes in the composition of the population in response to local demand shocks; it appears important to adjust for these changes when the estimates exploit differences across local labour markets.",Labour force participation and job polarization: Evidence from Europe during the Great Recession,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300853,30 June 2020,2020,Research Article,266.0

We use the staggered introduction of Universities of Applied Sciences (UASs) in Switzerland as a quasi-natural experiment to identify causal effects. Firms located near a new UAS campus experience an education-driven labor supply shock in the form of UAS graduates newly entering the local labor market. Using a large representative firm survey and applying a difference-in-differences model, we find that this labor supply shock has positive effects: first, on the percentage of R&D personnel relative to total employment and, second, on the percentage of total wages paid to them. These effects are driven by both ==== (five to nine employees) and very large ones (5,000 or more). Our findings suggest that a tertiary education expansion can stimulate innovation activities by increasing the personnel resources devoted to R&D.","A tertiary-level education expansion creates a supply shock of graduates with R&D-specific skills in the labor market, giving firms easier and more opportunities to hire graduates for their R&D departments. Therefore, governments often expand tertiary-level education institutions to increase innovation and competitiveness through providing more future workers with the skills necessary for R&D activities (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, 2010, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD, 2017). However, causal empirical evidence on the employment effects of tertiary education expansions is rare, particularly on how firms respond in terms of employing R&D personnel. Thus investigating whether and, if so, to what extent firms make use of workers with new R&D skills is very important. More specifically, analyzing whether firms employ more R&D personnel and increase overall spending on R&D personnel (as wages) is crucial.====This paper analyzes how the educational supply shock resulting from the introduction of a particular type of tertiary education institution—University of Applied Sciences (UASs), which recruit their students from vocational apprenticeship graduates and which both teach and conduct applied research—has affected firms’ employment in R&D in Switzerland. The government introduced UASs to provide graduates from dual apprenticeship programs (i.e., upper-secondary-level vocational education) with an educational upgrade to the tertiary level (Swiss Coordination Centre for Research in Education, SCCRE, 2018). Therefore, students at UASs are not comparable to students at other tertiary education institutions, because UAS students already have a sound vocational knowledge base through their secondary-level vocational education. By obtaining a UAS degree, these students attain more advanced vocational and professional knowledge combined with applied research skills, often using them for, and in close cooperation with, local firms. Therefore, we expect the introduction of UASs to have different effects on firms’ R&D than the introduction of academic universities, which generally recruit their students from high school graduates. Due to the UASs’ close combination of a strong practical vocational knowledge base with applied research skills, we expect substantial effects on R&D and innovation, particularly in firms or regions that did not previously have a strong tradition of innovation.====To identify the causal effect of the introduction of UASs, we exploit a quasi-random variation in the location and timing of the openings of UAS campuses in Switzerland in the 1990s. In so doing, we follow a growing literature that uses the openings of new tertiary education institutions as an identification strategy (e.g., Jäger, Kamhfer, Schmitz, Westphal, 2019, Kyui, 2016, Pfister, Rinawi, Harhoff, Backes-Gellner, 2018, Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016). We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) design to compare the employment of R&D personnel in treated firms (i.e., firms in labor market regions where a UAS campus has opened) to the employment of R&D personnel in untreated firms (i.e., firms in labor market regions where no UAS campus has opened).====For our analysis, we draw on repeated cross-sectional data from the Swiss Earnings Structure Survey (ESS). This data allows us (a) to observe firms at the establishment level (i.e., at their different locations), which we need to identify treated and untreated locations, and (b) to precisely measure firms’ R&D personnel by providing information on the job tasks of individual workers and, in turn, on firms’ direct labor input dedicated to innovation activities. Through these unique ESS data features, we can investigate how the labor supply shock resulting from the introduction of UASs affects the employment of R&D personnel (measured as the percentage of a firm’s personnel with R&D tasks as their main job activity). Moreover, we can also investigate the effect on wages paid to R&D employees (measured as the percentage of the total wage sum paid to personnel with R&D tasks as their main job activity) in treated establishments in comparison to untreated establishments.====Our analysis shows that firms affected by the opening of a UAS campus employ more R&D personnel and spend more money on R&D personnel, clearly engaging more intensively in R&D. This finding implies that firms located near a UAS campus use the R&D skills available in the labor market after the opening of the campus. Furthermore, we study whether these effects are heterogeneous across different types of firms and find that both very small firms (with 5–9 employees—and thus possibly start-ups) and very large firms (with 5,000 or more employees) profit from the introduction of UASs. These results show that an education expansion providing individuals with relevant practical skills in applied R&D can stimulate firms’ innovation activities. Particularly for small firms, the skills of UAS graduates constitute a valuable resource, enabling these firms to engage in or intensify their R&D activities.====This paper contributes to three strands of the literature on how the skills available in local labor markets influence firms’ innovation activities. First, we contribute to the literature on the innovation effects of tertiary education institutions (which produce skills for local labor markets) by providing evidence on the innovation effect of introducing a new tertiary education institution that—compared to an academic university—teaches different types of skills to graduates of different types of secondary education. Despite numerous studies on the effect of academic universities on innovation (e.g., Audretsch, Feldman, 1996, Cowan, Zinovyeva, 2013, Jaffe, 1989), no evidence exists on the effect of the structurally very different UASs—tertiary education institutions teaching graduates from dual apprenticeship programs and focusing on vocational and applied research knowledge—on innovation activities.====Studies investigating the innovation effect of traditional academic universities, which teach high school graduates and focus on theoretical knowledge and basic research, confirm that firms gain from academic universities and that these spillovers are concentrated in firms close to an academic university (e.g., Andersson, Quigley, Wilhelmsson, 2009, Anselin, Varga, Acs, 1997, Autant-Bernard, 2001). Moreover, studies examining the innovation effect of academic universities focusing on technical knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—universities that still teach graduates from high-school programs and that do not focus on vocational and applied research knowledge—show that these institutions raise, for example, the propensity for graduates to become inventors (Bianchi, Giorcelli, 2019, Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016). In addition, studies on the openings of U.S. colleges, some of which teach and conduct applied research but primarily to high school graduates, also show positive innovation effects (Andrews, Moretti, 2004).====Nonetheless, all these tertiary education institutions structurally differ from the UASs we analyze in this paper. Although some of these institutions teach a certain amount of applied or STEM-related skills, they do not focus on students who are graduates from dual apprenticeship programs and who already have a solid practical vocational knowledge base from their three- to four-year education, which includes an apprenticeship in firms. Thus we specifically analyze the effects of the close combination of solid practical vocational skills from a dual apprenticeship program with applied research skills. Such a combination might have particularly sizable effects on R&D intensity and innovation in firms or regions that did not previously have a strong tradition of innovation.====Second, we add to the literature that examines the importance of vocational skills for innovation activities by demonstrating that augmenting the skill base of vocationally trained workers with applied research skills contributes to innovation activities in firms that have access to the new type of graduates. Only few studies show that secondary-level vocational skills (i.e., those of graduates from dual apprenticeship programs) positively affect innovation in firms (e.g., Meuer, Rupietta, Backes-Gellner, 2015, Rupietta, Backes-Gellner, 2019, Toner, 2010). Moreover, Cinnirella and Streb (2017), who study 19====-century Prussia, identify the knowledge of “master craftsmen” (a form of advanced skills in a specific occupation) as an important driver of technological development in that century. Our paper extends these findings by providing first evidence that augmenting secondary-level vocational skills (which UAS students alreay have from their dual apprenticeship training) with tertiary-level applied research skills has additional effects on firms’ innovation activities, as measured by an increase in R&D employment and intensity.====Third, we extend the literature that assesses the innovation effect of tertiary education expansions (e.g., Cowan, Zinovyeva, 2013, Leten, Landoni, Van Looy, 2014, Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016) by directly showing that firms’ use of the newly available skills for their R&D activities constitutes one mechanism underlying the innovation effect of tertiary education expansions. While Pfister et al. (2018) find that the introduction of UASs in Switzerland increases innovation outcomes (as measured by patenting activities), we show that firms’ employing UAS graduates as an input for their R&D activities is a potential driver of the increase in innovation outcomes. Moreover, our results show that the particular skill combination of UAS graduates (sound practical vocational knowledge and applied research skills) forms an important missing link between vocationally trained middle-skilled workers in production and academically trained workers in R&D. Their presence helps increase innovation capabilities through a more effective combination of different types of knowledge and, consequently, more creative solutions to innovation problems (Backes-Gellner, Pfister, 2019, Schultheiss, Pfister, Backes-Gellner, Gnehm, 2019).====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 explains the institutional background of the introduction of UASs in Switzerland and hypothesizes how the resulting supply shock of skilled labor may influence firms’ R&D. Section 3 describes our ESS data and our measures of R&D personnel. Section 4 presents and discusses our DiD approach to identify the treatment effect.

We use administrative data on the universe of Dutch DI recipients to estimate employment and earnings responses to reassessment of their earnings capacity under more stringent rules. We estimate that reassessment of recipients aged 30–44 removed 17 percent from the program and reduced benefit income by 20 percent, on average. In response, employment increased by 6.7 percentage points and earnings rose by 18 percent. Recipients were able to increase earnings by € 636 for every € 1000 reduction in DI benefit. This earnings response was strongest from those with more subjectively defined disabilities and a shorter claim duration, as well as younger and female recipients.","Disability insurance (DI) is intended to compensate for lost earnings capacity. The difficulty lies in determining how much has been lost. Overly stringent assessment leaves people underinsured. Overly lax assessment encourages moral hazard. Evidence on the earnings response to reduced DI entitlement resulting from stricter assessment of the earnings capacity of benefit recipients can help determine whether the right balance has been struck.====This paper uses administrative data on the universe of Dutch DI recipients to estimate the impact on earnings, and employment, of reassessment of their earnings capacity under more stringent criteria that could result in benefits being terminated or cut substantially. If the reassessments were effective in identifying recipients with untapped earnings potential, then reduced benefits should have raised earnings. If, on the other hand, the reassessments were overly aggressive or poorly targeted, then the earnings response would be muted. We estimate the average effect of reassessment on earnings and scale this by the average reduction in benefits to assess the effectiveness and targeting of the upward revisions made to earnings capacity. In doing so, we extend the evidence base on the labor supply effects of DI — the second largest item of social insurance expenditure in many countries — by adding to only a handful of studies that estimate effects of cutting the entitlement of current benefit recipients (Borghans, Gielen, Luttmer, 2014, Deshpande, 2016, Deuchert, Eugster, 2019, Moore, 2015).====We identify the effect of a 2004 reform by comparing the change in earnings (and other outcomes) of DI recipients aged 30–44, whose entitlement was reassessed under stricter criteria, with the respective change among older recipients, who were not reassessed. Unlike studies that rely on difference-in-differences (DID) between age groups to identify effects of more stringent criteria at ==== for DI (Karlström, Palme, Svensson, 2008, Staubli, 2011), we adjust for the age difference in the outcome trend over a period prior to the reform. This trend-adjusted DID (Bell et al., 1999) eliminates age-specific trends, as well as period effects. Identification rests on the assumption that, in the absence of the reform, the difference between age groups in the outcome trends would have been the age group difference in the trends observed in the earlier period. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the age differential in the trends is similar over multiple periods prior to the reform. A placebo test also lends credibility to the identification: implementing the empirical strategy with data on individuals who are not DI recipients, we find no “effect” of a pseudo reform on earnings.====We estimate that, on average over all DI recipients aged 30–44 targeted for reassessment, application of the more stringent rules reduced the amount of DI income received by 20 percent relative to what it would have been if there were no reform, raised employment by 20 percent and increased earnings by 18 percent; implying high elasticities of employment and earnings with respect to benefits. Receiving € 1000 less from DI was compensated by earning € 636 more in the labor market, on average. Apparently, some younger Dutch DI recipients had considerable untapped earnings potential that more stringent assessment of their benefit entitlement induced them to utilize.====The Netherlands provides an interesting context in which to assess the earnings potential of DI recipients. It is known for high DI dependency that reached 12% of the insured population at the beginning of the 1990s but also for a series of reforms, such as the one we examine, that are claimed to have contributed to a two-fifths reduction in this dependency (Koning and Lindeboom, 2015). Countries, such as the US, looking for ways to manage the escalating fiscal burden of DI can potentially learn from the Dutch experience (Autor, 2015, Burkhauser, Daly, McVicar, Wilkins, 2014). By examining a reform that occurred a decade into the paring back of an initially generous program, we deliver evidence that is more relevant to the situation prevailing in other countries than the evaluation by Borghans et al. (2014) of an earlier Dutch reform that took effect when DI dependency was substantially higher than elsewhere.==== Our estimate of the rate at which earnings replaced lost DI income is actually very close to that obtained by Borghans et al., indicating that even after a decade of retrenchment some DI recipients still had considerable unused earnings potential they could call on to replace around two thirds of substantial reductions in benefits. However, it is important to emphasize that these were a minority of the stock of DI recipients. Most did not have their benefits reduced despite being subjected to reassessment of their earning capacity under more stringent criteria.====Much of the evidence on the earnings crowd-out from DI comes from studies that follow Bound (1989) in using the earnings of rejected applicants to place an upper bound on the earnings potential of successful applicants (Chen, Van der Klaauw, 2008, Von Wachter, Song, Manchester, 2011).==== Exploitation of plausibly exogenous variation in the award or appeal probability can eliminate upward bias in the estimated earnings potential ==== (Autor, Kostol, Mogstad, Setzler, 2017, French, Song, 2014, Maestas, Mullen, Strand, 2013). But this quasi-experimental strategy will still overestimate the average earnings potential of the stock of beneficiaries if skills and preferences for work deteriorate while on DI (Bryngelson, 2009, Svensson, Müssener, Alexanderson, 2010, Vingård, Alexanderson, Norlund, 2004). Evidence obtained from comparison of accepted and rejected applicants is pertinent to the impact of policies that tighten entry to DI. It is less relevant to assessing the potential of reforms, such as the one we examine, that aim to release any earnings potential of benefit recipients.====There are only a few studies that, like this one and Borghans et al (2014), estimate labor supply responses of DI recipients to cuts made to their benefits. Moore (2015) finds that 22 percent of US Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients entered employment after being removed from the program because they had (partly) qualified through an addictive disorder. Deshpande (2016) estimates that 18-year-olds removed from another US DI program following stricter medical review were able to increase earnings to an extent sufficient to replace only one third of the benefit income lost. Relative to the cuts made to benefits, these labor supply responses in the US are smaller than those of Dutch DI recipients that we and Borghans et al. estimate. This may be due to differences in the DI programs, but it could also reflect differences in the DI recipients studied. Those qualifying through an addiction were only two percent of the stock of SSDI recipients, and their work preferences and capacities may have been quite distinct. At the age of 18, the DI recipients studied by Deshpande lacked the labor market experience that may have conditioned their labor supply response to benefit cuts. We estimate responses of all recipients aged 30–44, who comprise more than a third of the stock of DI recipients in the Netherlands, where, as in other countries, the DI roll is becoming younger.====Besides being one of the few studies to estimate earnings responses to targeted reductions in the benefit entitlement of DI recipients, this paper adds to the meager evidence on whether and how these responses vary with time spent on DI (Autor, Maestas, Mullen, Strand, 2015, Gelber, Moore, Strand, 2017, Moore, 2015). Using claim durations of up to 15 years, which is substantially longer than other studies, we find that reassessment induced a smaller earnings response from those who had been claiming for longer. Interestingly, the earnings response of partially disabled recipients who were working at the time of reassessment did not decline with claim duration.====We find that DI recipients who qualified through more subjectively defined health problems — mental health and musculoskeletal conditions — experienced the most aggressive cuts in benefits, indicating the greatest upward revisions in assessed earnings capacity, and were able to increase earnings to replace larger fractions of these cuts. This is consistent with the argument that loosening of the criteria for DI entitlement from precisely defined medical diagnoses to the more nebulous concept of ==== lengthened DI rolls by opening the door to claims based on difficult-to-verify health problems (Autor, 2015, Autor, Duggan, 2006).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines key features of the Dutch DI program and the reform we evaluate. Section 3 sets out our identification strategy. Section 4 describes the data and examines trends in the outcomes. Section 5 presents the results starting with full sample estimates, then a placebo test and robustness analysis, followed by examination of the relationship between earnings responses and claim duration, and then heterogeneity analyses.

We use measures of this exposure to estimate the long-run effects of the EITC on women's labor market outcomes as mature adults, specifically at age 40. Although the sample size is small, our results suggest that exposure to a more generous EITC when mothers were unmarried and had older (school-age) children leads to higher earnings in the longer-run, and we find corresponding evidence suggesting that longer-run exposure of unmarried mothers to a more generous EITC increases cumulative labor market experience. Additionally, we find evidence to suggest that exposure to a more generous EITC when women had children while married leads to lower earnings and hours in the longer-run. For both groups, adjustments in hours worked along the intensive margin appear to drive these results. These longer-run effects are consistent with what we would expect from the short-run effects of the EITC on employment and hours predicted by theory and documented in other work.","The extensive literature on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States – a program that substantially subsidizes earnings in low-income families with children – has focused nearly exclusively on short-term effects. This literature establishes that a more generous EITC increases employment for less-educated, single mothers (e.g., Meyer, 2010), who are important target recipients of the program. Other research shows that these work incentives lead to poverty reductions even without taking account of the income from the credit (Neumark and Wascher, 2011). Both types of effects are important and establish a strong case for the EITC as a pro-work, anti-poverty policy.====The presence of such short-run labor market effects suggests the EITC could also affect outcomes in the longer run. Specifically, the positive employment effects for low-skill, single mothers could increase labor market experience in the longer-run, boosting earnings via greater human capital accumulation; other types of investment, including more intensive search for better paying jobs with stronger prospects for earnings growth, could also be spurred by a more generous EITC that has positive short-term effects on employment. Such long-run increases in earnings would provide an additional policy rationale for the EITC: early expenditures raise short-term employment, and higher earnings in the long-run increase economic self-sufficiency, likely coupled with higher income tax receipts and reduced dependence on the EITC or other government assistance, helping to offset the earlier expenditures.====The predicted short-run effects of the EITC on married (or higher-earning) women are in the opposite direction.==== The evidence ranges from no or modest negative labor supply effects to more sizable labor supply reductions (e.g., Eissa and Liebman, 1996; Hoffman and Seidman, 2003). Of course, even small short-run effects could potentially accumulate into larger effects over the longer run.====We test for evidence of longer-run effects of the EITC, adopting a very long-run perspective. Given that EITC payments depend on number of children (directly) and marital status (indirectly, via the spouse's income), we must be able to observe a woman's childbearing and marital history in order to capture the long-run effects of the EITC. The need to capture this history, combined with the requirement to capture state variation in the EITC based on state of residence, dictates our use of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Specifically, we use longitudinal data on marriage and children from the PSID to characterize women's exposure to the federal and state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from ages 22-39 – corresponding roughly to their first two decades of adulthood when women bear children as well as a large share of the period when they raise children. We then use measures of this exposure to estimate the long-run effects of the EITC on women's earnings and related labor market outcomes as mature adults, defined here as age 40.====Although the small sample size in the PSID leads to some imprecision in estimates that makes drawing firm conclusions a challenge, we find evidence suggesting that exposure to a more generous EITC when women were unmarried and had older (school-age) children leads to higher earnings in the longer-run. We also find corresponding evidence suggesting that longer-run exposure of unmarried mothers to a more generous EITC increases cumulative labor market experience (using a subset of our primary sample for which we can measure this). Finally, we find evidence to suggest that exposure to a more generous EITC when women had children while married leads to lower earnings and hours in the longer-run.====We base our analyses on a difference-in-difference-in-differences specification measuring the presence of children and marital status across ages 22-39 and exposure to the EITC. From this simple specification, we add two elements: one better captures the labor market incentives of the EITC (age of a woman's youngest child); and the second may more cleanly identify policy effects (separate federal and state maximum credits). We subject this preferred specification to a number of checks meant to account for endogenous behavior or policy, a placebo test, and a number of robustness/sensitivity analyses. Among these checks, we include alternative parameterizations of EITC generosity and checking whether the results reflect changes in other anti-poverty policies. These analyses show that the findings are robust, and bolster a causal interpretation of the evidence, although there are some limitations to how rigorously we can establish causal effects, which could be addressed in future research.",The Long-Run Effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Women's Labor Market Outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300828,26 June 2020,2020,Research Article,269.0

To do so, we analyze Spanish data on parental investments and find that college-educated parents increase their time investments and choose better schools for children who are younger than their classmates at school entry, while non-college-educated parents do not do any of both. Consistent with this compensating behavior, we document a lower age-at-school-entry penalty among children with college-educated parents.","Life (policies) can put some children at a disadvantage. In such cases, parents can react to those disadvantages by changing their investments in their children. However, parents’ reactions might depend on their resources, which involves important implications in terms of inequality, social mobility, and policy impacts. Our understanding of such responses is limited, however, because a proper empirical analysis requires both exogenous variation in exposure to disadvantages and the availability of detailed data on parental investments.====In this paper, we get around these limitations by looking at a variation in exposure to school disadvantage that is both well documented as potentially exogenous and easy to observe across datasets, including those with information on parental investments. Specifically, we use time-use surveys and school-based questionnaires to study how parents from different socioeconomic statuses (SES) in Spain react to a widely-used school policy that puts some children at a learning disadvantage: age at school entry.====Most countries dictate that children born during a given one-year period should start school at the same time. This (up-to-one-year) difference in the age of students in the same classroom may be reflected in student performance. For instance, younger children might be less ready to acquire knowledge and deal overall with the experience of formal schooling. If initial outcomes shape future outcomes, the age at school entry can have long-term consequences for schooling and labor market trajectories (see Section 2.1).====A large body of literature shows that starting school at an earlier age is indeed related to worse student performance, labor market outcomes, and criminal behavior.==== Furthermore, this negative effect might be greater among people from disadvantaged backgrounds, at least in some contexts (see Michael and Bernardi, 2017 on England, Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014 on Sweden, and McEwan and Shapiro, 2008 on Chile).====Before looking at potential differences in parental investments, we first document that the children who were younger at school entry tend to perform worse in school than the children who were older at school entry. Using Spanish data from four waves of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we find that students who started school at a younger age are more likely to have repeated a grade and have lower test scores in mathematics and reading at age 15 than older children. For example, students born in December (the youngest age in their cohort) are 10 percentage points more likely to have repeated a grade by age 15 than those born in January (the oldest age).==== We go further and explore how this pattern translates into long-term outcomes, using information from the population census. We find that adults who were younger at school entry have less schooling and less-educated partners.====A causal interpretation of the documented age effect requires that 1) parents do not postpone the timing at which their child’s entry school, and 2) there is no connection between the characteristics of newborns and their month of birth. Some parents might be willing to enroll their children in school beyond the typical age of entry if they are sufficiently concerned about any negative effects associated with children’s age at school entry. Spain enforces a strict birthday cutoff for school entry, so even if they wish to, parents cannot easily postpone the year when their child starts school (see Section 2.2). Alternatively, there could be a connection between a newborn’s characteristics and birth month if parental characteristics or relevant environmental (institutional) conditions that shape fetal (newborn) health vary during the year. To study this potential seasonality in births we analyze both the population census and birth certificate data. Using census-type data of the Spanish population allows us to detect birth patterns that could go unnoticed in survey data because of a smaller sample size. Indeed, we find that there is some seasonality in births. However, we do not find systematic differences in the parental and newborn characteristics of babies born in December and January (just before and after the birthday cutoff for entry to school, which is January 1st). We confirm this pattern by looking at differences in parental characteristics between people born in December and January in the datasets used in our main analysis.====We therefore focus our analysis on people born in January (the oldest age at school entry) and December (the youngest).==== Using data from PISA, we show that the effect of the age at school entry is significantly larger among children from disadvantaged families. For instance, young students from low-SES families are 12.7 percentage points more likely to have repeated a grade by age 15 than older students from the same socioeconomic background. This gap is only 4 percentage points among students from high-SES families.====To analyze whether this difference is related to parental investments according to family background, we assemble two different datasets with detailed information about parental investments: the two waves of the Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS; 2003 and 2009) and the General Diagnostic Assessment (GDA==== or==== in Spanish, is a 2009 national evaluation of fourth grade students with information on parental involvement and school characteristics). Our focus on parental time investments in child development is grounded in the child development literature, which shows that the time parents spend with children is an important input for the children’s cognitive development, particularly for young children (Del Boca et al., 2014).We find that college-educated parents increase the amount of time they spend helping their children with school activities and that they choose schools with better inputs when their children are the youngest at school entry, whereas parents without a college education do not do any of both. Specifically, we find that college-educated parents spend an average of five more minutes per day helping their children with school activities when their children are the youngest at school entry, a result that is statistically significant at the 5% level. This is a large effect, considering that parents in our sample spend on average 7.5 minutes per day helping their children with school activities. This effect increases to 10 minutes per day when we focus on children who are 6 to 12 years old, the age window in which parental help with school tasks is concentrated (averaging 12.5 minutes per day), and to 15 minutes per day when we exclude the summer months (when children are out of school). Supporting the idea that these differences in parental help are related to what happens at school, we do not observe a similar pattern among parents of preschool-age children.====Finally, we find suggestive evidence of different gender patterns among children from high-SES families. On one hand, younger boys from high-SES families do not seem to be able to overcome the school entry age disadvantage by the age of 15. Probably because they face a larger disadvantage, they receive more help from their parents with their homework and other academic activities, and they are more likely to attend schools with better inputs. On the other hand, younger girls from high-SES families do not have different achievement levels at age 15 relative to older girls from high-SES families. Probably because they face a smaller disadvantage, parents do not seem to invest more on them. We find no such gender-specific effect among children from low-SES families.====Our results highlight the importance of considering behavioral responses to policy in the impact evaluation literature based on reduced-form estimates. The reduced-form effects of a policy include both a direct (policy) effect and an indirect effect consisting of endogenous responses to the policy—in our case, parental responses to the school entry age (Todd and Wolpin, 2003). To disentangle policy effects and production function parameters, we need to understand behavioral responses to policies.====The main contribution of this paper is to the emerging literature on parental reactions to education policies. In seminal papers, Pop-Eleches and Urquiola (2013) show that parents in Romania are less likely to help their children with homework when they are admitted to more effective schools, while Das et al. (2013) find that parents in India decrease their education spending when their children are enrolled in schools that receive grants that can be spent on educational materials.==== We contribute to this literature by highlighting how these reactions might vary according to the family’s SES and the student’s gender, and by providing more detailed evidence on parental responses. In the closest study to ours, Fredriksson et al. (2016) show that larger class sizes in Sweden increase the likelihood that high-income parents help their children with their homework and low-income parents move their children to a different school. Relative to this paper, we make two contributions. First, we use richer measures of parental investments, which allows us to quantify the magnitude of changes in parental time investments and analyze how these responses evolve over their children’s lifecycle. Second, we look at whether parental responses depend on the interaction between parental SES and children’s gender.====We also contribute to the ample literature on the effects of age at school entry. A strand of papers has documented that these effects are heterogeneous by SES in several contexts. Our contribution is to provide novel evidence on a plausible mechanism behind this heterogeneity—differences in parental investments in terms of time and school choice. In a contemporaneous work, Dhuey et al. (2019) use data from the state of Florida in the United States to show that high-SES parents are more likely than low-SES parents to postpone the enrollment of their children in school by one year (which is allowed in the United States). Their results support our findings that high-SES parents are more likely to help their children when they are among the youngest at school entry.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the relationship between age at school entry and student outcomes and describes the institutional framework. Section 3 presents the data, and Section 4 the identification strategy.

In the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (2017), for example, the median 25- to 35-year-old household head lives about five miles from a parent or an in-law.==== This lack of mobility, often explained by high moving costs, has prompted concerns about workers being stuck in depressed labor markets.==== But young adults might also benefit from living close to their parents.====We document the labor market benefits of living close to parents by showing that the earnings of young workers who live near their parents recover after a job displacement. In contrast, workers who live farther away experience large, permanent declines in earnings, as in Jacobson et al. (1993) and Davis and von Wachter (2011). Nearby workers appear to benefit from help with childcare. However, workers do not appear to benefit from searching longer for a new job because they can move back in with parents. Job referral networks might also play a role, though our evidence about them is limited.====Our baseline result is that 25 to 35 year olds who live in the same neighborhoods as their parents see their earnings recover after a job displacement.==== Those who live farther away suffer large, permanent earnings losses. While job displacements are plausibly exogenous (von Wachter et al., 2009), children’s locations are not randomly assigned, so our results are not necessarily causal. The results do, however, suggest a causal mechanism: They include propensity score reweights that control for detailed characteristics of workers, the jobs they lose, and the places they live. Unobservable differences that remain after reweighting would lead to the opposite pattern—lower earnings after a job displacement—if unobservable differences that lead workers to live closer to their parents also lead to worse outcomes after displacements. For example, workers could live close to their parents because they care for them, because they struggle with change, or because of particularly high moving costs. Workers who live near their parents also are worse off in observable ways; for example, they are less educated.====We also find several pieces of evidence that convenient childcare from workers’ parents drives our baseline result. First, the benefit of nearby parents is concentrated in states where market-based childcare is costly. Second, young workers who lose jobs from inflexible occupations (as defined in Goldin, 2014), in which free and convenient childcare would be most valuable, experience the greatest benefits from nearby parents. Third, workers’ nearby parents decrease their hours worked following their child’s displacement, and we find evidence that these labor supply decreases are not due to correlated shocks. The decrease in workers’ nearby parents’ labor supply is consistent with reductions in workers’ parents’ labor supply after the birth of a first grandchild, as in Rupert and Zanella (2018). Fourth, the effects are concentrated among workers who live in the same neighborhood as their parents, as opposed to the same city. This evidence is consistent with close proximity facilitating irregular childcare (emphasized by Compton and Pollak, 2014) and with workers valuing nearby childcare (Rosenthal and Strange, 2012). Fifth, older workers, who are less likely to have children at home, do not benefit from living closer to their parents, which is also consistent with workers living near their elderly parents to care for them (Chari, Engberg, Ray, Mehrotra, 2015, Lin, Rogerson, 1995, Lin, Wu). Finally, our main result is driven by workers who end up having children.====Our results are consistent with local social networks insuring earnings after a job displacement, as in Corak and Piraino (2011), Kramarz and Skans (2014), and Topa and Zenou (2015). We show that workers find jobs in their parents’ industries after displacements, but our estimates are statistically insignificant and exhibit a pre-trend.====Our findings suggest that parental proximity provides labor market insurance to young workers, as opposed to it only restricting labor market options and imposing additional burdens. We extend the findings in Compton and Pollak (2014), who document that the availability of childcare from grandmothers increases the labor supply of married women, to the earnings of a mostly-male sample after a job displacement.==== We show that our results are consistent with a simple model in which parents facilitate better job offers for their children. In the model a preference for living at home will restrict workers’ labor market options and lead to the opposite pattern of earnings from our baseline result. Empirically, our baseline result also applies to workers who do not move after a job displacement, so restricted labor market options are an unlikely explanation.====Our results support previous research (Dalton, Kaplan, 2012, Munshi, Rosenzweig, 2016) showing that nearby parents provide labor market benefits to young workers, but three pieces of evidence suggest that the results are not because parents facilitate longer job searches by transferring resources or allowing children to move back in with them. First, we find that children who live closer to their parents spend similar amounts of time unemployed after a displacement. Second, we find that children benefit from parental proximity when they live in the same neighborhood as their parents, but outside of their houses. Third, we find only small increases in transfers of money and housing around displacement, and transfers of money and housing are not any larger among workers who lived closer to their parents before a job displacement.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data, describes our sample, and presents our main earnings results using averages. Section 3 describes our regression and propensity score reweighting methodologies. Section 4 presents our baseline earnings results, decomposes them into hours and wages, and presents heterogeneous effects of parental proximity. These heterogeneity results emphasize the importance of childcare and suggest that our main result is not driven by geographic mobility or co-residence, and that parental proximity matters for young workers, independent from where they grew up. Section 5 investigates further evidence on mechanisms including workers’ parents’ labor supply, housing transfers, and parental employment networks. Section 6 discusses selection and unobserved heterogeneity in the context of our results and the economic significance of our empirical estimates. Section 7 discusses broader implications of our work and avenues for future research.",Parental proximity and earnings after job displacements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300816,20 June 2020,2020,Research Article,271.0

In line with this model, regional rank-rank slopes steadily increase over the period we observe, while the expected ranks of children in the national income distribution fluctuate in ways that partly mirror the changing economic fortunes of Australian regions.","Equality of opportunity is central to many conceptions of a just society, and a perennial touchstone in public policy debates. Accordingly, there is a vast related literature in economics on intergenerational mobility — the extent to which economic outcomes persist from one generation to the next (Black, Devereux, 2011, Solon, 1999). Increasingly studies explore regional differences in intergenerational mobility within countries.==== These differences are of interest in their own right, but may also shed light on the mechanisms that drive differences in outcomes (for example, see Chetty and Hendren (2018) and Deutscher (2020)).====We provide the first national and regional estimates of intergenerational income mobility using Australian administrative data. Australia emerges as among the more mobile advanced economies – and hence a potentially informative example of high mobility outside the Nordic countries. While mobility is rapid across most of Australia, there are meaningful differences within the country, and its states, territories and cities. These regional measures correlate with a variety of potential mechanisms for mobility, from good school attendance to strong local labour markets. In the final section of the paper we explore the stability over time, in theory and in practice, of this “geography of mobility” that is an increasingly common feature of the literature.====Data constraints have limited the quantity and quality of Australian evidence on intergenerational income mobility to date. Most existing studies lack data on income for long periods in both generations, often leading researchers to impute parental income using methods that have required strong assumptions.==== There is also no evidence on geographic differences in intergenerational mobility within the country. National estimates for Australia are interesting in their own right and, when compared with other countries, may also shed light on the value of certain institutional features of the country and how these may enhance or impede mobility. Regional differences within Australia may also provide insights as to how differences in industry composition, economic growth or other unique aspects of different regions may matter for mobility. A key obstacle to producing definitive mobility estimates for Australia has been the lack of the kind of large, long and representative panel dataset that administrative data can provide. Large panels enable researchers to produce more precise national estimates as well as estimates for smaller geographic regions. Long panels hold promise for more effectively addressing the variety of measurement challenges that is endemic to the intergenerational mobility literature (e.g. Haider and Solon (2006); Mazumder (2005); Solon (1992)).====We address these challenges by producing the first estimates of intergenerational mobility based on Australian tax data. We find that intergenerational persistence in income is quite low and that intergenerational mobility is consequently quite high. We estimate the intergenerational elasticity of income (IGE) for Australia to be 0.185 and the Spearman correlation (or rank-rank slope) to be 0.215. By way of contrast, (Chetty et al., 2014) estimate an IGE and rank-rank slope of around 0.34 for the United States; while more recent estimates addressing limitations in their data put the IGE at 0.5 or higher and the rank-rank slope at 0.4 or higher (Mazumder, 2016). Our estimates for Australia are more comparable to recent Canadian estimates of an IGE of 0.20 and a rank-rank slope of 0.24 (Corak, 2019). The estimates are also close to Nordic countries such as Denmark and Norway where estimates of these parameters are typically around 0.2 or lower. While precise rankings of countries are fraught given differences in data sources, definitions and panel lengths, these findings nonetheless suggest Australia is among the more mobile countries in the world.====We also estimate other rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility, such as conditional expected ranks. We find that the expected rank of individuals whose parents were at the 25th percentile is the 45th percentile. Those who started at the 75th percentile could expect to land at the 56th percentile.==== This illustrates substantial upward and downward mobility. In the United States there are only 53 cities out of 381 that have higher rates of upward mobility than Australia taken as a whole.====Our qualitative results do not change when adjusting for potential sources of bias, including measurement of income over too short a period or too early or late in life, nonlinearities in intergenerational relationships, missing income observations, and missing or incorrect parent-child links. Consistent with recent research abroad and in Australia, rank-based measures appear less sensitive to many of these concerns (Mazumder, 2016, Murray, Clark, Mendolia, Siminski, 2018, Nybom, Stuhler, 2017). Our most conservative estimates using our baseline sample lift our estimated IGE to 0.210 (from 0.185) and our rank-rank slope to 0.232 (from 0.215).====We also present the first regional estimates of intergenerational mobility across Australia. While there is significantly less dispersion in mobility across Australian regions relative to the United States, meaningful differences nonetheless emerge — both within the country and within individual cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. Perhaps most notable is the influence of the mining boom, which appears to have lifted the expected ranks (in the national income distribution) of children raised in resource-rich regions. The boom appears to have ‘lifted all boats’, as although upward mobility was higher in the mining regions, the rank-rank slope was no lower than that experienced by other regions. We explore a range of correlates of intergenerational mobility, finding that regions with higher incomes and lower unemployment rates tend to have higher conditional expected ranks for those raised there; while regions with less segregation and higher school attendance rates have lower rank-rank slopes.====Given the recent proliferation of regional estimates of intergenerational mobility, we end with an exploration of the stability of regional estimates of intergenerational mobility. To provide a framework for this, we extend a generalised error-in-variables model to the setting of regional rank-based estimates of mobility. The model highlights the potential sensitivity of regional estimates to local income shocks. These shocks flow directly through to conditional expected ranks but only influence the rank-rank slope to the extent they are correlated with parental income. This suggests regional estimates of conditional expected ranks may be more volatile than regional estimates of the rank-rank slope – a possibility that is borne out in the Australian experience. To illustrate this, we produce regional estimates of intergenerational income mobility from 2000 onwards. National estimates are significantly attenuated (show more mobility) towards the start of this period, but stabilise towards the end of our panel in 2015. Regional rank-rank slopes follow a relatively similar pattern, and most of their variation over time is well explained by a common attenuation process. However, conditional expected ranks are much more volatile, and move in ways that can be at least partly explained by fluctuations in the local labour market.====Regional estimates of intergenerational mobility – at times referred to as the “geography of mobility” (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014, Corak, 2019) – are of significant public interest, and can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying intergenerational mobility (Chetty, Hendren, 2018, Deutscher, 2020). Regional estimates are also increasingly produced using rank-based measures, which have been shown to stabilise more quickly at a ==== level with the respect to the ages and lengths of time over which incomes are observed. We provide an important caveat to this growing literature in highlighting that stable national estimates may mask underlying volatility in regional estimates, particularly conditional expected ranks, potentially driven by local economic fluctuations. Future studies may benefit from keeping this in mind in interpreting and exploiting the geography of mobility.",Intergenerational mobility across Australia and the stability of regional estimates,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300658,17 June 2020,2020,Research Article,272.0

We exploit a unique episode in the history of the National University of Singapore, in which a university-wide revision in graduation requirements in 2007 prompted students in one of the largest faculties to read a narrower, more specialized, curriculum. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we compare changes in the labor market outcomes of graduate cohorts from the affected faculty, before-and-after the curriculum revision, to changes in the labor market outcomes of graduate cohorts from the other faculties. We do not find evidence that curriculum breadth matters for these labor market outcomes. Similar conclusions are obtained using regression-control strategies and rich administrative data on student characteristics and academic ability for the broader population of undergraduates at NUS.","It is not uncommon to hear official claims that reading a broader curriculum will help to improve a person's position in the labor market. The above quote by a senior representative of one of the largest public universities in Singapore, exemplifies this point. Several other universities have made similar assertions. One university declares on its website that “we are moving away from the rigid curriculum structure to a flexible, broad-based curriculum in order ====”==== while another asserts “…we need well-rounded graduates in all fields ====. That's why it's crucial that we provide our students a broad-based education that prepares them for successful careers…”.==== Such statements indicate that senior university administrators believe that reading a broader curriculum is helpful in the labor market.====Despite the boldness of these assertions, the academic literature has been largely silent about their validity. While a number of studies have attempted to estimate the relationship between breadth of curriculum and individuals’ subsequent labor market performance, these have hitherto focused on curriculums read at the secondary school level (Dolton and Vignoles, 2002; Johnes, 2005; Oosterbeek and Webbink, 2007; Malamud and Pop-Eleches, 2010; Malamud, 2012; Hall, 2012, 2016). The majority of these studies do not find much evidence that the breadth of the curriculum taken in secondary school matters for individuals’ subsequent labor market outcomes, whether these outcomes are measured by earnings (Dolton and Vignoles, 2002; Johnes, 2005; Oosterbeek and Webbink, 2007; Malamud and Pop-Eleches, 2010; Hall, 2012), employment (Hall, 2016), or labor market participation (Malamud and Pop-Eleches, 2010).====To our knowledge, much less research exists on the labor market impacts of curriculum breadth at the tertiary level. Yet, for tertiary-educated workers, there is reason to expect that the effect of curriculum breadth read at the secondary school level may be different from that read at the tertiary level. This may be the case if the skills and knowledge acquired in higher education and in secondary school are valued differently in the labor market or if employers place greater emphasis on more recent qualifications when making hiring and promotion decisions. Consequently, the findings from studies focusing on the secondary school context may not generalize well to higher education. The purpose of this paper is therefore to fill the gap in the literature by exploring whether the breadth of courses taken in university matters for one's future labor market outcomes. Specifically, we seek to address the question, “What are the labor market returns to taking a broader curriculum in university?”.====Why might school curricula matter for people's subsequent labor market outcomes? A short answer is that they are one of the key inputs in the production of education. By shaping what individuals are exposed to, they influence the type and quantity of skills and knowledge students acquire. To the extent that skills and knowledge acquired in school affects a person's subsequent labor market productivity (Becker, 1962, 1964), curriculums could therefore matter. While a narrower curriculum may provide students with more in-depth training and knowledge in a specific area, a broader curriculum potentially exposes students to training and knowledge in a greater variety of areas, but may do so at the expense of reduced specialization. Contrary to the above arguments put forth by universities, it is not clear that reading a broader curriculum will necessarily provide graduates with an edge in the labor market. Though it might help graduates acquire greater diversity in skills and knowledge of value in the labor market, increase the range of job options open to graduates====, and provide individuals with more time to gather information about their abilities and preferences before settling on a particular specialization in school====, it might not prepare them sufficiently to meet the needs of specific jobs, especially if these jobs require in-depth specialized knowledge in specific areas (Silos and Smith, 2015).====The few existing studies which investigate the labor market impacts of curriculum breadth at the post-secondary school level include Silos and Smith (2015), Lazear (2005), and Malamud (2010, 2011). Silos and Smith (2015) consider the choice of the optimal mix of skills acquired through postsecondary education, when there is uncertainty about how different occupations fit individuals, and the implications that this choice has for earning dynamics. They find that while acquiring a broad set of skills generates higher income for people who switch occupations, acquiring a specialized set of skills benefits those who stick with one type of job. Lazear (2005) builds a model of the choice to become an entrepreneur and shows that students who study a more varied curriculum are more likely to become entrepreneurs. Malamud (2010) and Malamud (2011) examine the labor market implications of early versus late specialization in higher education by comparing across the English and Scottish undergraduate systems in the United Kingdom. Because late specialization reduces the opportunity for students to acquire field-specific skills, these studies essentially compare between specialized (early specialization) and broad (late specialization) curricula. Malamud (2010) finds that average earnings do not differ significantly across the two systems while Malamud (2011) finds that individuals who specialize early are more likely to switch to an occupation unrelated to their field of study. While these findings are informative, and suggest that the benefits from better matches to fields of study arising from later specialization are sufficiently large to outweigh the costs from the loss of specialized skills, it is hard to draw causal conclusions from them given that students in the English and Scottish systems may differ in unobservable ways.====Our analysis is based on rich administrative data, collected from several cohorts of undergraduates from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore's largest public university. These data include detailed information on each student's background characteristics, university transcript, including the list of courses taken and the grades received, and responses to an employment survey conducted by the university which provides each student's gross monthly earnings and labor force status six months after graduation. We exploit a unique episode in the history of the university, in which a revision of graduation requirements in 2007 prompted one of the largest faculties to increase major requirements, which raised the share of modules students need to take in their area of specialization, compelling them to read a narrower, more specialized, curriculum. On the other hand, other faculties increased the number of electives students can take outside their major, thereby allowing students greater flexibility to read a broader, less specialized, curriculum.====Simple bivariate regressions show a negative relationship between curriculum breadth and labor market outcomes, with a 0.17% decrease in monthly earnings with every 1 percentage point increase in the share of modules read outside one's major. However, the effects are weaker after controlling for student socio-demographic characteristics, entry route and pre-university academic achievement. In fact, after controlling for differences in university academic achievement, including class of honors and cumulative average point (CAP), we find that curriculum breadth has little association with labor market outcomes six months after leaving university. Our results suggest that, at least at this early-career stage, while employers place weight on academic performance, little additional consideration is given to course diversity.====Next, using the exogenous change in curriculum structure across faculties and over time, we obtain difference-in-differences results for the impact of curriculum breadth on labor market outcomes. Specifically, we compare the change in labor market outcomes across cohorts from faculties which compelled their students to read a narrower curriculum against the change across cohorts from faculties which offered their students more flexibility to read a broader curriculum, before-and-after the imposition of these curricular revisions. Our results suggest that the curricular revisions led to a decline in curriculum breadth by around 10% among affected students in the first set of faculties, but no significant change among students in the second set of faculties. We estimate that the former group saw a 0.8% decline in entry earnings, 0.7 percentage points decline in probability of full-time employment and 1.15 percentage points increase in probability of unemployment, but that none of these effects are statistically significant at the 10% level. We conclude that the impact of taking a more diverse curriculum is generally weak, consistent with our multivariate analysis.====Our study offers several contributions to the breadth-of-study literature. First, it examines the causal returns to curriculum breadth at the university level, an area of inquiry which has hitherto been understudied. Second, unlike most previous studies, we have rich background information on students, including their socio-demographic, pre-university, and university-level characteristics, as well as measures of academic ability in university and prior to university, allowing us to control extensively for an array of student characteristics which are likely correlated with curriculum breadth and labor market performance. Finally, we exploit the unique policy change at NUS, which produced plausibly exogenous variation in curriculum breadth to identify the impact of reading a broader curriculum, and in so doing, address concerns over the endogeneity in curriculum breadth.====The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows.

By contrast, men do not report lower life satisfaction from working more hours than their female partners. An analysis of possible mechanisms shows that in couples where the woman works more hours than the man, women do not spend significantly less time doing household chores. Women with egalitarian ideologies are likely to perceive this unequal division of labour as unfair, ultimately reducing their life satisfaction.","Gender equality in high-income countries has come a long way since the 1950s, with women now accounting for almost half of the entire labour force. In addition, the gender gap in earnings has substantially declined. However, despite these gains and the increasing trend in female educational achievements and decreasing trend in fertility rates over the last few decades (Black and Juhn, 2000; Goldin and Katz, 2002; Goldin et al., 2006), women still earn less and work fewer hours than men.====One potential explanation for this is that women's progression in the labour market puts pressure on women and causes adverse well-being for couples. More than ever, women seem to approach the question of work and family as black and white: either they pursue their careers and continue doing most of the domestic work, while feeling unhappy, sad, stressed and tired for most of the day (Bertrand, 2013), or they quit their jobs or reduce their number of working hours because they feel this to be the only viable option to keep their partner – and themselves – happy.==== There is no in-between. As an illustration of this trade-off, research has shown that women's career progression and increasing divorce rates are highly correlated (Folke and Rickne, 2020). Highly educated women are also less likely to marry than their less-educated counterparts, and many of them choose to remain childless as a consequence of their higher wage potentials (Bertrand et al., 2016).====In this paper, we study the well-being patterns of couples where women's relative working hours exceed those of their husbands. Using data from the United States, UK and Germany, we show that women are ceteris paribus less satisfied with their life when working longer hours than their husbands. By contrast, husbands do not report lower life satisfaction by being in a relationship where they work relatively long hours compared with their wives. These results continue to be robust even after including individual fixed effects and addressing the potential endogeneity of relative working hours between husbands and wives.====We argue that these results are best explained by evidence that in couples where women work more hours than their husbands, women continue to perform a more significant proportion of household tasks than their husbands. As a result, women are likely to feel overwhelmed and dissatisfied with their life. To provide evidence of this mechanism, we first examine how men and women allocate their time doing household tasks when working more hours than their partners. We find that women who work longer hours than their husbands do not spend significantly less time doing household chores than women who work fewer or the same hours as their husbands. These results support the idea conceptualised by Berk (1985) and West and Zimmerman (1987) that couples who deviate from traditional gender roles keep ‘doing gender’ by allocating housework responsibilities unequally at home (see also Bittman et al., 2003; Brines, 1994; Greenstein, 2000; Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, 2010; Cooke, 2006).====Provided that women whose working hours exceed those of their husbands hold less traditional views concerning the allocation of household tasks, this general lack of substitution in home production is likely to reduce well-being for women. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find evidence that women's dissatisfaction from working longer hours than their husbands is significantly alleviated by a decrease in time spent doing household tasks. These results are consistent with studies in sociology that have found that women are more likely to perceive the division of household tasks as fair (Pleck, 1985; Thompson, 1991; Blair and Johnson, 1992; Lennon and Rosenfeld, 1994) and to report higher levels of well-being (Ross et al., 1983; Yogev and Brett, 1985) in households where their husbands help out more with the household chores or outsource them to other people.====We are able to rule out several alternative explanations. First, we find little evidence in our data to support the hypothesis that women are averse to working long hours and have a preference for part-time work (see Booth and Ours, 2008, 2009; Schröder, 2018). Another explanation with little support is that women report lower life satisfaction not because they work longer hours than their husbands ====, but because their working hours are long in an ==== sense and that they are tired from having to come home and still do most of the housework (Hochschild and Machung, 1989). Rather, our results suggest that women do not report lower satisfaction when working long hours and performing most of the housework ====. Finally, we look at the timing of women's relative working hours and find no evidence that women experiencing lower life satisfaction are taking on more working hours than their husbands.====The fact that women whose working hours exceed those of their husbands feel less happy and dissatisfied with their life poses the question of how they could have incorrectly predicted their future feelings in the first place. For instance, according to positive assortative mating theory, men who are married to women whose working hours exceed theirs should, in principle, hold more egalitarian attitudes in general and compensate their wives by taking on more household tasks. One possible explanation for this misalignment is that there is imperfect assortative mating with respect to egalitarian views both at home and in the workforce, and that husbands’ beliefs about gender and marital roles may not have improved as much as their wives’ over the years. We therefore end our paper by providing evidence that women who work more hours than their husbands hold more egalitarian attitudes towards the division of household chores, on average, than women who work fewer or the same number of hours compared with their husbands. Moreover, we find that women feel dissatisfied from working longer hours than their husbands, while performing most of the household tasks, only in couples where women hold more egalitarian views on average.====Our paper replicates and builds on the results in Fleche et al. (2018), who present only simple correlations between life satisfaction and relative working hours within households. In this paper, we replicate the results using more data – both in terms of timespan and country coverage – and use these data to establish a plausible mechanism through which relative working hours may influence women's life satisfaction. Perhaps surprisingly, the number of works that have investigated the relationship between husbands’ and wives’ relative working hours and their related life satisfaction is sparse. Amongst the few notable studies, Booth and Ours (2008, 2009) have shown that men are more satisfied with their hours of work if they work full time, while women prefer part-time jobs. In addition, women's life satisfaction increases if their partners work full time, while men's life satisfaction is unaffected by their partners’ working hours. In a more recent paper, Schröder (2018) provide evidence that fathers – and to a lesser degree, childless men and women – are more satisfied with life if they work full time or longer. By contrast, fathers’ life satisfaction is unaffected regardless of whether their wives spend more or fewer hours in employment. Our results go beyond these studies by investigating the direct relationship between relative working hours within households and life satisfaction. They also relate to previous findings by Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) showing that as women's wages and working hours have been increasing both absolutely and relative to those of men, their life satisfaction has been decreasing over recent decades.====We also contribute to an extensive literature that seeks to understand the causes and consequences of inequalities in household task allocation (Becker, 1973, 1974). In particular, the evidence that the level of husbands’ contribution to housework is not strongly related to women's labour supply is well documented. Bittman et al. (2003), Brines (1994) and Greenstein (2000) highlight the fact that men who work fewer hours than their wives tend to adhere to a more traditional division of housework to ‘do gender’ and manage couples’ interactions in light of traditional norms (see also Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, 2010; Bertrand et al., 2015; Ichino et al., 2019). Many studies in sociology have also shown that women are more likely to perceive a division of labour as unfair and to report lower levels of marital satisfaction if their husbands do not contribute sufficiently to household tasks (see Pleck, 1985; Yogev and Brett, 1985; Blair and Johnson, 1992; Lennon and Rosenfeld, 1994). However, the latter results tend to rely on cross-sectional analysis or short panels (mainly in the United States). We add to this literature by showing that these results are pervasive, observed in both the United States and Europe and over long periods.====Finally, we contribute to the literature by considering gender ideologies as a moderating factor in the household division of labour on well-being. If it is well documented that there is a strong association between the number of hours a wife spends doing domestic work and the gender ideologies held by both husband and wife (see Blair and Litcher, 1991; Kamo, 1988; Sanchez, 1994; Greenstein 1996a, 1996b, 2000; Fernandez et al., 2004; Ichino et al., 2019), then it seems that most researchers on this topic have overlooked the interaction effects between husbands’ and wives’ ideologies and their consequences on the household decision-making process, one exception being Greenstein (1996a). Using data on 2719 married couples from the National Survey of Families and Households, Greenstein provides evidence that husbands do relatively few household tasks “====”.==== We find that women are likely to feel the least satisfied when working more hours than their husbands in couples where women adhere to more egalitarian gender norms than their husbands.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces our main data sources. Section 3 reports our results on the relationship between relative working hours and men's and women's well-being. Section 4 provides a variety of evidence that the household division of labour partly explains why women suffer more than men from working more hours than their wives. Section 5 investigates gender ideologies as a moderating factor in the effect of household division of labour on couples’ well-being.

The program’s main content was a wage increase of about 5%. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I study whether the program led to a change the characteristics of newly hired teachers in terms of educational background and academic achievement, and estimate student achievement effects to discuss ","Teacher recruitment is deemed difficult in disadvantaged schools, and several studies document how teachers sort out of schools associated with disadvantaged students, see e.g., Jackson (2009), Bonesrønning et al. (2005), Lankford et al. (2002). Difficulties with recruiting qualified teachers to such schools suggest negative teacher sorting, which impedes the ideal of equal educational opportunities. Teacher workload is typically considered to be higher in disadvantaged schools. Hence, teachers might sort out of schools with the highest workload, all else being equal. To overcome teacher sorting out of disadvantaged schools, increased wages or better working conditions could give disadvantaged schools a competitive advantage to recruit competent teachers.====In 2009, a benefit program was introduced for disadvantaged schools in the city of Oslo, in which the most important component was increased wages. I exploit this policy to study how the benefit program affected recruitment in terms of teacher qualifications.====Improved potential for teacher recruitment should make it possible for the affected schools to hire more competent teachers. If students are exposed to higher teacher quality on average, student achievement might be positively affected by the benefit program.====The purpose of the reform was to attract more highly qualified teachers and replace short-term personnel without teaching qualifications with better qualified teachers. I study whether the benefit program was able to achieve this by estimating the probability of hiring teachers with high educational attainment. Moreover, I estimate changes in student performance following the reform to discuss whether the benefit program also changes teacher effectiveness in the schools.====There might be general changes in recruitment over time. The affected schools had in common that they were disadvantaged, and they are thus not necessarily comparable to other schools. To make causal inferences, I therefore use a difference-in-differences approach. I compare the difference before and after the reform in schools affected by the reform to the difference in schools not affected by the reform. The analysis is based on administrative register data from Statistics Norway where we link employees and students to schools. The benefit program only applies to new teachers employed at the schools, hence the recruitment effect is isolated without concern for effects on retainment of teachers.====The benefit program consists of three elements: higher wages, reduced workload in combination with guidance from experienced teachers, and a paid teacher training course for teachers without formal teaching qualifications to acquire such qualifications. The program covered more than 30 of the schools in the largest school district in Norway for at least a year. Implementation of the program started in 2009, and more schools have gradually been included. The gradual implementation of the reform makes it possible to test whether there are specific changes to the reform schools driving the results by using later implementing schools as comparison group for the treatment effects for the first years.====The literature suggests a moderate, positive effect of wages on teacher recruitment using a range of outcomes (Ballou, Podgursky, 1995, Figlio, 1997, Gilpin, 2012, Leigh, 2012). Falch (2016) uses a quasi-natural experiment to estimate the effect of wages on the recruitment of licensed teachers and finds a positive effect. For teacher retention, Falch (2011) finds that the same wage increase decreased voluntary exits among teachers. Hendricks (2014) finds the same pattern when studying teacher turnover and teacher pay in Texas. For public sector recruitment in general, Bo et al. (2013) exploit a wage experiment to study the effects of wages on civil servants in Mexico, finding positive selection effects.====For recruiting and retaining the right teachers, it is essential to recognize the most effective teachers. Rivkin et al. (2005) state that while some observable teacher characteristics are associated with effectiveness, there are substantial differences in teacher effectiveness not being explained by observables. Experience is considered to have a positive effect during the first few years after starting a teaching career (Harris, Sass, 2011, Rivkin, Hanushek, Kain, 2005, Wiswall, 2013). Cognitive ability as measured by college selectivity and teacher licensure test scores might be positively related to teacher effectiveness (Clotfelter et al., 2010). Rockoff et al. (2011) suggest that combining non-traditional measures of teacher effectiveness could improve predictions of teacher effectiveness, but that traditional measures have less predictive power. Goldhaber and Brewer (1997) and Monk (1994) find that strong background in STEM==== increases student performance in these subjects. However, teachers with a master’s degree are not found to be more effective than other teachers (Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006). For teacher certification, results are more inconclusive, with substantial geographical variations in the content of teacher certification (see Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006 for an overview).====If schools can identify their needs, the ability to attract a large pool of applicants for available positions increases the probability of finding the right match. To identify the right match is not necessarily straightforward: Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) argue that, even though the applicant pool increases with higher wages, schools are not able to identify the most effective teachers. On the other hand, using Norwegian data, Naper (2010) finds that when hiring decisions are made at the school level, more effective teachers are hired than when hiring decisions are made at the school district level. This result indicates that unobservable characteristics of high-quality teachers are in fact observable to the school. Using applications-to-transfer data, Boyd et al. (2011) find that schools prefers teachers with characteristics that signal high ability.====Performance pay has been a focal point in the literature on the effect of teacher wages on student achievement. It is widely acknowledged to improve student performance, at least in the short run (Figlio, Kenny, 2007, Lavy, 2009). There is less evidence on the effect of non-incentivized wage increases on student achievement. One exception is Loeb and Page (2000), who find that higher wages could lead to a substantial decrease in high school drop-out rates in the US. A more recent contribution by Britton and Propper (2016) exploits centralized wage regulation in England and find substantial effects of teacher wages on final exams in compulsory education.====Incentive-based policies, such as performance pay, have been recommended by e.g., Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) as a more cost-efficient way of improving student performance than resource-based policies. However, for urban schools that struggle to attract teachers, resource-based policies could be considered necessary to counteract teachers sorting out of vulnerable schools. Machin et al. (2010) show that more resources in urban schools in London increased attendance and student performance in mathematics.====I find positive effects on the probability of hiring teachers with master’s degrees, and the results are robust to various comparison groups. Teachers hired under the reform also stay longer. There are indications of improved student achievement in terms of externally graded final exams, which might imply that the teachers hired by the reform are different also in terms of effectiveness.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional setting and relevant features of the teacher labor market in Norway. Section 3 outlines the empirical strategy, while Section 4 describes the data used and some descriptive statistics. In Section 5, the results for teacher recruitment are presented and robustness tests performed, while Section 6 discusses the case for student achievement.

However, both anecdotal and the available statistical evidence suggest that workers who wish to switch to a part-time work schedule often encounter resistance, if not outright opposition, from their employers. A quick search on the Internet confirms this: there is a multitude of online forums where workers complain that their employers have not allowed them to work a reduced number of hours. It is not unusual for workers, particularly females, to be forced to leave their jobs following a denied request to switch to a part-time work arrangement. Accordingly, Gasparini et al. (2012) reported that only about 30% of full-time employees in EU-15 feel that their employer would favorably consider their request to reduce their working hours.====There may be several reasons why firms are generally unwilling to satisfy the requests of their workers to switch to a part-time contract. The communication and start-up costs associated with part-time work and the difficulties of optimally staffing part-time employees might lead to efficiency losses in a firm’s organizational structure. In a recent study, we have found, after accounting for a large number of worker and firm-level characteristics, that part-time work is, in fact, linked to significantly lower firm productivity, and that this result holds for different categories of firms (Devicienti et al., 2018). If firms can compensate for this productivity gap by offering lower wages to part-time workers, they should be indifferent between employing the workers according to a full-time or a part-time schedule. However, this is usually unfeasible in most industrialized economies, where the law dictates that part-time workers should have the same monetary (and non-monetary) benefits as comparable full-time workers. In some countries, such as Italy, the law even allows for a more favorable treatment of part-time workers. The emergence of a zero or positive part-time/full-time wage differential, coupled with the lower productivity associated with part-time arrangements, could help to understand the reluctance of firms to satisfy the requests of workers to switch to part-time schedules. This paper, which tackles the analysis from a firm’s viewpoint, is aimed at investigating whether this happens or not.====In order to estimate whether part-time schedules have a different cost from full-time arrangements, we use a very large data set, which covers the universe of private-sector employees in Italy over a period of more than 30 years. This data set is based on administrative data from the Italian Social Security System (INPS) and links each employee to the firm he/she works in, thereby allowing a large amount of longitudinal worker-, firm-, and job-level information to be exploited. This multiple-level information is crucial to assess the presence of any wage differentials associated with part-time arrangements, since a multitude of factors can simultaneously determine wages and the part-time work status. We concentrate on the impact of a change in the working time arrangement of the same worker within the same firm. This allows any confounding effects, due to the presence of unobserved fixed worker, firm, and job match heterogeneity, to be removed. At the same time, we control for an ample set of time-varying observable factors that might also confound the effect. Particular attention is devoted to controlling for the employee’s work history, with specific reference to accumulated experience in the labor market, in part-time and full-time work. We also pay attention to any possible contemporaneous endogeneity stemming from maternity and from the employer undergoing periods of economic crisis, which are likely to simultaneously influence a change in the working schedule and wages.====In this study, we focus on females. This decision was taken for several reasons. First, females constitute the vast majority of part-time workers. Second, they represent the most relevant segment for the aims and policy implications of this paper. Females are those that are more likely to ask for (temporary) transitions to part-time work, often to conciliate work with family commitments. A denied request to switch to a part-time arrangement may entail withdrawal from work, with well-known long-lasting consequences in terms of earnings and the possibility of successfully re-entering the labor market. Third, part-time work for males is a very heterogeneous phenomenon and, unlike what happens for women, it is mostly involuntary (i.e., most men working part-time would prefer a full-time position). Fourth, we concentrate on females for comparative reasons, since most studies that have examined part-time/full-time wage differentials have focused on women.====Several papers have analyzed part-time/full-time wage differentials, but most of them have investigated the issue from the workers’ viewpoint. These studies were mainly interested in assessing the determinants of part-time/full-time wage differentials, and how the part-time status influences the future earnings and career trajectories of workers. Particular attention has been devoted to gender issues, either by concentrating the analysis on women or by juxtaposing part-time earning differentials with gender wage gaps (Manning, Petrongolo, 2009, Matteazzi, Pailé, Solaz, 2018, Mumford, Smith, 2009, Pacelli, Pasqua, Villosio, 2013); to the impact of switching to a part-time contract on the future earnings and career prospects of the workers (Connolly, Gregory, 2009, Fernández-Kranz, Rodríguez-Planas, 2011, Paul, 2016); and to the presence of a possible heterogeneity of part-time wage differentials along the wage distribution (Gallego Granados, Nightingale, 2019, Simon, Sanroma, Ramos, 2017).====This paper contributes to the existing part-time literature in several ways. It is one of the few studies that explore the wage effect of switching to a part-time contract while remaining with the same employer. Moreover, the use of administrative data on the universe of workers and firms over a period of more than three decades allows us to explore the long-run dynamics of the part-time/full-time wage differential, and to run separate analyses on many different categories of workers and firms, based on, for instance, age, migration status, parenthood, job duration, occupation, and the firm’s size, industry, and location. The dimension of our data entails that, for each of these analyses, we can remove any confounding factors related to worker, firm, and match-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Furthermore, in order to explore the mechanisms at play, we investigate whether the effects vary between short and long part-time work (as in Paul, 2016) and between switches from full-time to part-time work and switches from part-time to full-time arrangements (as in Booth and Wood, 2008, and Day and Rodgers, 2015). We also explore the relevance of the mechanisms related to workers’ commuting to work and differential rent-sharing by part-time status within the firm.====Fernández-Kranz and Rodríguez-Planas (2011), who used longitudinal matched employer-employee data to estimate part-time/full-time wage differentials in Spain are, to the best of our knowledge, the only scholars who have controlled for both unobserved individual- and firm-level fixed heterogeneity, as we do in this paper.==== They reported significant part-time wage penalties for female workers, which remained after controlling for individual and firm fixed heterogeneity, and which were particularly pronounced for temporary workers. On the contrary, our estimates point to the existence of pervasive wage premiums associated with part-time work schedules, which are transversal to many different segments of the labor market. These results, together with other additional results presented in this paper, are compatible with part-time premiums that stem from the relatively higher protection accorded to (female) part-time workers by unions and sectoral collective agreements.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the mechanisms that can lead to a wage differential between part-time and full-time work schedules. Section 3 reviews the existing empirical literature on the part-time/full-time wage differential along two main dimensions: estimation methods and cross-country evidence. Section 4 outlines our empirical model, the type of effect that we identify, and its relationship with previous empirical works. Section 5 describes the data, Section 6 shows and discusses our results and, finally, Section 7 outlines the implications of our findings and draws conclusions.",Why do firms (dis)like part-time contracts?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300683,6 June 2020,2020,Research Article,276.0

We test the hypothesis that networks and the ability to communicate in the host country language, as proxied by linguistic distance, are substitutes in the location decision. Based on individual-level data from a special evaluation of the European ==== (EU-LFS) and a random utility maximization framework, we find that networks have a positive effect on the location decisions while the effect of linguistic distance is negative. We also find a strong positive interaction effect between the two factors: networks are more important the larger the linguistic distance between the home country and the host region, and the negative effect of linguistic distance is smaller the larger the network size. In several extensions and robustness checks, we show that this substitutable relationship is extremely robust. Especially, we demonstrate that our results are not biased by multilateral resistance to migration.","Previous research has shown that migrants tend to settle where other migrants of the same ethnicity or from the same country of birth have settled before. The importance of migrant networks and diasporas for the location choice of migrants even persists after taking into account other factors such as income differences, employment opportunities, colonial ties, and geographic distance (see, e.g., Beine, Docquier, Özden, 2011, Beine, Docquier, Özden, 2015, Bertoli, Ruyssen, 2018, Damm, 2009, Nowotny, Pennerstorfer, 2019, Pedersen, Pytlikova, Smith, 2008). The literature has identified a number of channels through which networks increase the attractiveness of a region for newly arriving immigrants. For instance, networks offer ethnic goods such as food, clothing, social organizations, religious services, media or marriage markets (Chiswick and Miller, 2005). Furthermore, established network members can provide information on housing or employment opportunities (Damm, 2014, Gross, Schmitt, 2003, Munshi, 2003), assist with the settlement process or reduce legal entry barriers via family reunification programs (Beine et al., 2015) thereby reducing the costs of migration (McKenzie and Rapoport, 2010).====In addition, studies have shown that skills in the host country’s language are an important determinant of migrants’ labor market outcomes such as earnings and employment (see, e.g., Bleakley, Chin, 2004, Chiswick, Miller, 1995, Dustmann, Van Soest, 2002). The ability to communicate in the host-country language may affect the marginal productivity, enhance the capability to accumulate human capital, and affect the occupational choice of migrants (Chiswick, Miller, 2010, Isphording, Otten, Sinning, 2014). It may also affect other social outcomes with important economic consequences, such as individuals’ health status or criminal activity (Clarke and Isphording, 2017). Therefore, existing skills and the potential difficulties to acquire knowledge in the host country’s language, as measured by the linguistic proximity between the source and the host country, are important factors for the location choice of migrants (see, e.g., Adserà, Pytliková, 2015, Belot, Ederveen, 2012, Belot, Hatton, 2012, Chiswick, Miller, 2015).====Whereas the effects of networks and linguistic proximity on migrants’ location decision have been studied extensively, hardly anything is known on how the two effects influence each other. From a theoretical perspective, we would expect the importance of networks to depend on the extent of language dissimilarities, and vice versa (Bauer, Epstein, Gang, 2005, Lazear, 1999): networks should be more important the larger the dissimilarity between the languages of the home country and the host region, and the negative effect of linguistic dissimilarity should be smaller the larger the migrant network. Building on previous literature, the present paper therefore analyzes the interaction between migrant networks and linguistic proximity in the location decisions of migrants. The linguistic distance between the language of the home country and the host region is used as a measure of the proximity of the two languages, thereby reflecting the difficulties migrants face in acquiring skills in the host region language (see Isphording and Otten, 2014). Analyzing the interaction between networks and linguistic distance improves our understanding of the factors that affect migration decisions and the location choice. The decision to migrate is an investment and a mechanism through which people try to improve their economic situation (Sjaastad, 1962). However, the move to a different location, where the returns to skills are potentially higher, is costly. Knowledge about the potential substitutability of factors that reduce the migration costs or increase the economic returns is crucial to facilitate a more efficient allocation of productive resources.====We further contribute to the existing literature by analyzing migrants’ location choice at a disaggregated regional level, thereby taking the sizeable regional differences within host countries into account. Only few studies have analyzed the location decision of international migrants from a regional perspective (see Åslund, 2005, Damm, 2009, Nowotny, Pennerstorfer, 2019, Rodríguez-Pose, Ketterer, 2012), hence within-country differences are largely underexplored in the migration choice literature. Yet, not only may the language spoken by the majority of the resident population differ between regions within a country, but migrant networks are also not equally distributed within a country. Besides regional variation in economic conditions that determine the attractiveness of a location in general, within-country differences in networks and language may provide an explanation why migrants (from certain source countries) cluster in some regions and not in others.====Lastly, our paper contributes to the literature by proposing an alternative way to deal with the issue of multilateral resistance to migration (Bertoli and Fernández-Huertas Moraga, 2013).==== By using a random parameters (mixed) logit framework (see McFadden and Train, 2000) to model migrants’ location choices, we are able to relax the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IID) assumption inherent to the conditional logit model and its Poisson equivalent usually applied in empirical research (see, e.g., Bertoli, Fernández-Huertas Moraga, 2015, Guimarães, Figueirdo, Woodward, 2003, Nowotny, Pennerstorfer, 2019, Schmidheiny, Brülhart, 2011).====Our empirical analysis is based on individual-level data from a special evaluation of the 2007 European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), which includes information on individuals’ country of birth as well as their region of residence (at the NUTS-2 level). The data can be linked to a linguistic distance matrix based on the Levenshtein distance for a comprehensive set of sending country-receiving region dyads. This enables us to capture within-country variation in linguistic distance and networks, respectively, and to analyze the location choice of migrants to the EU at a disaggregated regional level.====Our results reveal that networks have a significant and positive effect on the location decisions of migrants while the effect of linguistic distance is, as expected, negative. We also find a strong positive interaction effect between the two factors: networks are more important the larger the linguistic distance between the home country and the host region, and the negative effect of linguistic distance is smaller the larger the network size. In several sensitivity analyses and extensions, we show that this substitutable relationship between networks and linguistic distance is extremely robust. Especially, we show that our results are not biased by multilateral resistance to migration. Taken together, these findings are consistent with our expectations that higher migration costs, due to higher language acquisition costs or a smaller network, can be offset by a larger network or by a lower linguistic distance.====These results have interesting implications. First, a better knowledge of the relationship between two of the main determinants of migrants’ location decision enhances our understanding of the location choice process. Hence, our findings have important implications for studies that investigate migration flows. Second, our results reveal that larger networks can decrease adjustment costs and increase the propensity to migrate to locations that are, from a linguistic perspective, very different to migrants’ home country. This suggests that large inflows of migrants from linguistically different origin countries, such as the recent inflow of refugees to Europe, can substantially reduce the adverse effects of linguistic barriers for new migrants and this way shape future migration flows.====The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the empirical methodology and describes the data used. In Section 3, we discuss our results and robustness analyses. Section 4 provides concluding remarks.","Linguistic distance, networks and migrants’ regional location choice",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300671,6 June 2020,2020,Research Article,277.0

Feedback often serves as a means to provide recognition to good performers as well as to help employees learn about how to improve one’s performance. Several recent studies, conducted in a variety of organizations and contexts, have shown that the provision of feedback can have sizeable positive effects on performance (Azmat, Bagues, Cabrales, Iriberri, 2019, Azmat, Iriberri, 2010, Azmat, Iriberri, 2016, Blanes, Nossol, Nossol, 2011, Delfgaauw, Dur, Sol, Verbeke, 2013, Gerhards, Siemer, 2016, Kuhnen, Tymula, 2012, Tran, Zeckhauser, 2012). On the contrary, Barankay (2012) and Bandiera et al. (2013) find an adverse effect of feedback on performance.====Providing employees with feedback has also become increasingly prevalent in education. Many schools use students’ evaluations of teachers to enable and motivate teachers to improve teaching. Moreover, students’ evaluations sometimes play a role in tenure, bonus, and promotion decisions (Watts and Becker, 1999). There is by now an extensive literature that studies the use of students’ evaluations in education. Cohen (1980) and Marsh (2007) present overviews of the literature.====This paper addresses the question under what conditions teachers are responsive to student feedback. We are particularly interested in how teachers’ responses depend on the content of the feedback. With the exception of Centra (1973), this question has not received any attention in the empirical literature so far.====We study a large group of teachers who work at a school that has so far not made use of any formal student feedback system. We collect student evaluations on all teachers as well as teachers’ self-assessments. We hypothesize that if a teacher receives student evaluation scores that are very similar to his or her self-assessment, (s)he has little reason to adjust teaching practices, and so (s)he is likely to receive similar student evaluations a year later. In contrast, if students express views that are much less favorable than the teacher’s self-assessment, the teacher may try to improve, resulting in better scores a year later. Teachers who receive student evaluations that are more positive than their self-assessment may slack down, as they may infer that less effort is needed in order to be evaluated well.====To test these hypotheses, we set up a field experiment at a large Dutch school for intermediate vocational education. Student evaluations were introduced for all teachers in the form of an electronic questionnaire consisting of 19 items. We implemented a feedback treatment where a randomly chosen group of teachers received the outcomes of their students’ evaluations. The other group of teachers was evaluated as well but did not receive any personal feedback. We examine the effect of receiving feedback on student evaluations a year later.==== Our key research objective is to find out whether the effect of feedback depends on how student evaluations differ from the teacher’s own performance assessment on the same items. For that purpose, we collect data on teachers’ self-assessed performance both before and a year after the experiment.====The results of our experiment show that receiving feedback has on average no effect on feedback scores of teachers a year later. We find a precisely estimated zero average treatment effect of 0.04 on a 5-point scale with a standard error of 0.05. Our result differs somewhat from the findings of the existing studies mentioned above. A possible explanation for the lack of an average treatment effect in our study may be that we investigate the effect of feedback in the long run. Feedback may affect short-run performance, but the effect may fade away in the long run, as Azmat et al. (2019) show in the context of providing relative performance information to students. While earlier studies on student feedback commonly consider the effects of receiving feedback within a semester, we study the effect of feedback on student evaluations a full year later.====Regarding the content of the feedback, we find – in line with our predictions – that there is no effect of the feedback treatment for teachers who evaluate themselves similarly to the students’ evaluation. The estimate of the treatment effect for these teachers is very close to zero. We do find a significant positive treatment effect for teachers who learn that their own assessment is much more favorable than their students’ evaluation.====Our findings are well in line with Centra (1973), the only prior study – to our knowledge – investigating whether teachers’ response to student evaluations depends on the discrepancy between teachers’ self-assessment and their students’ evaluations. Among a sample of about 350 teachers at 5 different colleges in the US, he finds on average little effect of mid-semester feedback on end-of-semester student ratings. However, among teachers for whom students’ mid-semester ratings fell short of their own assessment, end-of-semester ratings increased more strongly as compared to similar teachers who did not receive feedback. Our study finds, in a different population, similar results that hold over the period of a full year.====How a teacher’s student evaluation scores compare to the student evaluation scores of her colleagues may also matter for the effect of receiving feedback. In our experiment, all teachers –both in treatment and control– were informed about the average of the evaluation outcomes of the teachers in their team. This implies that some teachers in the treatment group learn that they perform better than their direct colleagues, while others learn that they perform worse. Relative performance information may matter for the performance of teachers when they care about their status (Auriol, Renault, 2008, Besley, Ghatak, 2008, Moldovanu, Sela, Shi, 2007) or when teachers want to conform to social norms (Bernheim, 1994, Sliwka, 2007). Our results show that the treatment effect is very close to zero for teachers who received student evaluation scores that are better than those of their teammates. We do find a positive but small (and only marginally significant) effect of feedback for workers who have worse student evaluation scores than their team on average.====An additional response of teachers to receiving student evaluations that conflict with their self-assessment is to adjust their self-assessment. We find only small effects of the feedback treatment on the self-assessment of teachers. Teachers who learn that their students’ evaluations are on average better than their self-assessment do not update their self-assessment. Teachers who learn that their students’ evaluations are worse than their self-assessment do lower their self-assessment of performance, but only to a limited extent.====When we presented our findings in seminars and conferences, we were often asked whether there are gender differences in the response to feedback. The literature suggests a couple of reasons for why a gender difference in responses may arise. Roberts and Nolen-Hoeksema (1994) and Johnson and Helgeson (2002) find that women are more likely to internalize feedback than men, in particular when the feedback is negative. In lab experiments, Möbius et al. (2007) and Buser et al. (2018) find gender differences in updating in response to relative performance, where women turn out to be more conservative in updating after receiving relative performance feedback than men. Azmat and Iriberri (2016) find that males’ performance improves significantly more than females’ performance after receiving relative performance feedback (in addition to feedback on individual performance). This gender difference does not depend on the content of feedback, and is stronger under individual pay-for-performance than under flat wages.====Performing our analysis separately for male and female teachers, we find that the pattern of responses as described above is entirely driven by female teachers. Whereas male teachers hardly respond to feedback independent of the content, we find that female teachers’ student evaluation scores increase significantly after learning that their student evaluation score falls below their self-assessment score as well as when they learn their score is worse than that of their team. Moreover, in contrast to male teachers, female teachers adjust their self-assessment downwards after learning that students rate them less favorably than they rated themselves. As this is an ex post analysis, these results should be considered as exploratory. Further research on gender differences in response to student feedback is warranted.====Finally, we investigate whether receiving feedback and the content of the feedback have an effect on teachers’ job satisfaction. Receiving information about performance might affect teachers’ job satisfaction when teachers intrinsically care about their performance (as in e.g. Besley and Ghatak, 2005, and Delfgaauw and Dur, 2008) or when they enjoy being perceived as a competent or dedicated teacher (as in Suurmond et al., 2004, or Benabou and Tirole, 2006). In either case we would expect that job satisfaction of teachers in the treatment group increases with the difference between student feedback and teacher’ self-assessment. Earlier work by Ryan et al. (1980) shows that the introduction of student evaluations negatively affects job satisfaction on average. Our results show that providing teachers with feedback on their performance has no significant effect on their job satisfaction. We also find that the effect does not depend on the content of feedback.====Several studies analyze the effects of the evaluation of teachers by external experts or by peers. In Taylor and Tyler (2012) and Burgess et al. (2019), peers evaluate elementary school teachers in the US and high-school teachers in the UK, respectively. In Briole and Maurin (2019), high-school teachers in France are evaluated by external inspectors. All three studies find positive effects of evaluating math teachers on students’ performance. Only Burgess et al. (2019) finds a positive effect for language teachers as well. None of these studies considers how the effect of feedback depends on its content.====An important limitation of our study is that we have no data on standardized student test scores or other objective measures of student performance. Hence, we cannot examine whether providing feedback affects students’ performance and/or teachers’ value added. Carrell and West (2010) and Braga et al. (2014) present evidence that student evaluation scores are ==== correlated with teachers’ value-added, raising doubts about the usefulness of student evaluations. Beleche et al. (2012), on the other hand, find a robust positive association between student learning and course evaluations. Likewise, Mengel et al. (2019) find a positive correlation for male teachers, while there is little correlation for female teachers in their sample. While these results have raised concerns about the meaning and usefulness of student evaluations in general, it is unclear what they exactly mean in our context. First, student evaluations have been rarely studied in the context of vocational education. The mixed findings on the correlation between student evaluation scores and student learning all stem from a tertiary education context (colleges and universities). It is unclear what to conclude from these studies for vocational education. Second, our student evaluation form goes way beyond the typical form used in tertiary education with only a handful of simple questions. Instead, the school took great care to design a rather extensive set of 19 questions which fit the local situation well and which the school’s management and representatives of the teachers believe might help the teachers to improve themselves. Third, even if in our context the student evaluation scores would have no (or a negative) correlation with learning outcomes, they may bear relevance in another way. The answers to the 19 questions in the student evaluation we study together sketch a picture of student satisfaction with the teachers, which may be of independent importance for students’ decision to continue their current study as well as students’ intentions to do a follow-up study. Fourth, and this holds more generally, a correlation between student evaluation scores and objective learning outcomes (be it positive, negative, or zero) is not necessarily a good predictor of what an improvement in student evaluations caused by teachers’ response to students’ feedback means for objective learning outcomes, Even if student evaluation scores and learning outcomes are negatively correlated (as is the case in some of the studies mentioned above), this need not be a causal effect, and an improvement in student evaluation scores caused by an intervention might go hand in hand with an improvement in student learning outcomes. Unfortunately, we are not able to shed light on these issues in our context, as we lack objective measures of student performance.====We proceed as follows. The next section provides a detailed description of the field experiment. Section 3 reports the descriptive statistics of the sample. In Section 4 we describe our empirical strategy. The results of the field experiment are presented in Section 5. We discuss gender differences in response to feedback in Section 6.

The hypothesized explanation of this employment and wage polarization is a phenomenon called Routine-Biased Technical Change (RBTC), wherein new machines and computers substitute for workers in mid-wage occupations that have a high content of routine tasks. Taking advantage of panel data for Britain and Germany, this study follows the work of Cortes (2016) and examines the ","Research demonstrates that in many industrialized countries during the last three decades, the employment share of mid-wage occupations decreased relative to the employment share in both higher- and lower-paid occupations (Autor and Dorn, 2013). At the same time, the wage of mid-wage occupations declined relative to higher- and lower-paid occupations (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). The hypothesized explanation is a phenomenon called Routine-Biased Technical Change (RBTC), in which new machines and computers substitute for workers in occupations that have a high content of routine tasks (Autor et al., 2003).====Previous studies have focused mainly on the aggregate effect on employment and wage growth, while the occupational mobility of individual workers that underlies the macro level phenomenon has received little attention. By extending the general equilibrium theory of worker occupational sorting and mobility from Gibbons et al. (2005) and Jung and Mercenier (2014); Cortes (2016) investigates individual occupational mobility arising from RBTC in the US labor market. He finds that when they face a relatively declining wage induced by RBTC, workers who do mid-wage routine occupations switch to non-routine occupations based on their skill levels. High-skilled routine workers switch to higher-paid non-routine cognitive occupations, while low-skilled routine workers downgrade to traditionally lower-paid non-routine manual occupations. In the US, this dynamics causes labor market polarization towards the higher-paid and lower-paid occupations.====Is the pattern found in the US market also present in other advanced economies that face technology advances if their institutions vary? Does Cortes's (2016) theory also predict patterns in other countries that have different economic environments? This paper follows Cortes's theoretical framework and applies its empirical method to two other industrialized countries. My analysis, which covers the period 1999 to 2008, is carried out using detailed household level longitudinal data from Britain (the British Household Panel Survey, or BHPS====) and Germany (the German Socio-Economic Panel, or SOEP====). The panel data allow workers’ individual-by-occupation fixed effects to be estimated and used as a proxy for the workers’ unobserved abilities. Then, the analysis relates the distribution of unobserved ability among those in mid-wage routine occupations to both job mobility and wage growth.====Institutional differences between Britain and Germany—for example, in the orientation and organization of their educational systems and in the protections that differing labor market institutions provide for workers—make comparisons of these two countries especially interesting. Unlike the British system, in which general education plays an important role in the preparation of workers for their careers, Germany has one of the world's most successful vocational education systems. Starting at a very early stage of the worker's educational path, youths are trained for employment in specific industries and occupations (Hoffman, 2011). This form of education is oriented towards specific skill development for workers who, it is argued, will be well prepared to fill jobs at the beginning of their careers because they have received instruction related to the particular jobs they are likely to work (Shavit and Müller, 2000). Nonetheless, some believe that in the case of workers who have a high proportion of human capital specific to particular industries, occupations, and employers, being trained for only certain jobs and industries and not for general skills can act as a barrier to the future occupational mobility of the German worker (Scherer, 2004). In contrast, the British educational system does not provide training that leads to smooth and well-regulated transitions into early careers (Scherer, 2001). Thus, this analysis of employment and wage polarization across countries provides a useful contrast between outcomes for countries that have different approaches to education at the primary and secondary levels.====Another important difference between Britain and Germany is the extent of unionization and the employment protection that each country provides (Autor et al., 2007; Boeri and Jimeno, 2005). As a typical Anglo-Saxon country, Britain is relatively more liberal in allowing market forces to operate in the labor market than Germany, which has stronger statutory protections for workers (Freeman, 2007). The right to form unions is part of the German Constitution. Accordingly, while trade union density in Britain started to sharply decrease during the late 1970s (Brook, 2002; Waddington, 1992), unionization in Germany continues to be a strong force. Waddington et al. (2005), for example, demonstrate that the German labor market is characterized by coordinated collective bargaining over wages and employment wherein union-employer agreements are settled initially at the national level and then extended to a large proportion of the labor force. Thus, the comparison of the effects of automation on routine jobs across Germany and Britain also draws a useful contrast between countries that differ greatly in their protections for workers.====The analyses conducted here confirm that from 1999 to 2008, different patterns of polarization occurred across Britain and Germany that related with technological advancement that favors occupations with different task compositions. In Britain, the wage premia in routine occupations fell relative to the higher-paid cognitive and lower-paid manual occupations. The effect of RBTC in Britain benefitted both non-routine cognitive workers and non-routine manual workers. These gains occurred as both employment and wages fell in routine occupations. These combined patterns—of workers transiting from mid-wage routine occupations upwards to non-routine jobs and downwards to manual occupations—are consistent with patterns of polarization observed in prior studies of the United States (Cortes, 2016).====In contrast, German workers in routine jobs also experienced decreases in employment demand and wages; however, the vast majority of employment mobility was to higher-paying cognitive occupations. Wages for workers who transited to the higher occupations grew. No wage growth was observed among manual occupations and there was little mobility in Germany from routine to the less well-paid manual occupations. Thus, in Germany, a country characterized by distinct educational and labor market institutions, employment and wages did not become polarized by RBTC to the degree that they did in Britain. The results for Germany also contrast sharply with the clear pattern of polarization reported from prior research for the United States (Cortes, 2016).====From a theoretical perspective that is illustrated by Cortes (2016), the analysis shows that in both countries the unobserved ability of workers, proxied by estimates of individual-by-occupation fixed effects, are strong predictors of routine workers’ occupational mobility. Higher unobserved skills among routine workers are positively related to switching to more highly-paid non-routine cognitive occupations. In Britain, those who have lower levels of unobserved skills are also more likely to move to lower-paid non-cognitive manual occupations. In Germany, low-skilled routine workers have little incentive to move down to manual occupations because the available pay remains lower than what is available in the routine occupations. The observed patterns of worker sorting and relative wages are consistent with the theoretical framework of the analysis.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the recent literature that examines RBTC among advanced economies. Section III summarizes Cortes's (2016) economic model to explain job mobility and wage dynamics across routine, manual, and cognitive occupational sectors and its predictions for the effects of RBTC. Section IV describes the empirical model used to test the theoretical predictions regarding RBTC, while Section V details the data for each country and variable construction.

However, there is little empirical evidence of whether minimum wage changes actually affect those families’ children. This paper examines the effect of the minimum wage on the math and reading achievement levels of children with low socioeconomic status whose parents are most likely to be affected by the minimum wage, comparing with children in households with high socioeconomic status. Estimates show that a $1 minimum wage increase reduces children’s math and reading scores by approximately 0.10–0.19 ====. Further, there is evidence that increases in the minimum wage lead to deterioration in the home environment, which may be one potential mechanism underlying my main findings.","The minimum wage continues to be the subject of critical, contentious policy debate in the United States. Many states and localities, including New York, California, Seattle, and San Francisco, have passed legislation to raise the minimum wage up to $15 an hour, more than double the existing federal minimum wage of $7.25. Amid new legislation, the minimum wage has drawn increased attention with regard to its effects on employment, income, and the overall well-being of a family. Although there is an expansive literature documenting the effect of the minimum wage on labor market outcomes,==== the literature does not provide evidence on an important margin, namely children’s cognitive achievement.====The effects of minimum wage changes can extend to influence children’s academic achievement through at least three channels. First, for those workers who have fewer employable skills, increases in the minimum wage increase the likelihood of joblessness or reduced work hours (Neumark et al., 2004). These effects on labor market outcomes reduce the number of resources available for children, and potentially negatively affect their cognitive achievement. Second, those individuals who are able to keep their jobs following a minimum wage hike can experience a reduction in the quality of their jobs, including a decline in fringe benefits and the loss of schedule flexibility (Wessels, 1980 and McKenzie, 1980). A decline in the quality of minimum-wage jobs can reduce parental investment in their children, adversely affecting their children’s achievement. Third, those individuals who can keep their jobs and have higher wages may be able to support their children’s cognitive achievement positively. This mix of potentially relevant mechanisms makes the effects of minimum wage changes on children’s cognitive achievement an important empirical question.====This paper investigates the way in which the minimum wage affects children’s cognitive achievement by exploiting the variation in the minimum wage across states and over time. My analysis is based on individual-level panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult, which follows biological children of mothers in the NLSY79. I use children’s math, reading recognition, and reading comprehension scores from 1986 to 2008.====Employing a child-fixed effect model, I start my analysis by examining the effect of the minimum wage on children from low-socioeconomic households which I define as those in which the mother has less than a high school degree.==== In my analysis, I define households in which the mother has a high school degree or beyond as high-socioeconomic households. In my baseline empirical specification, I compare children’s outcomes to changes in exposure to the minimum wage over time, netting out time-invariant child-specific unobserved heterogeneity and other unobserved family backgrounds. My results show a statistically significant effect for the low-socioeconomic status children. I find that a $1 minimum wage increase leads to around a 0.16 standard deviation decline in math scores, around a 0.13 standard deviation decline in reading recognition scores, and around a 0.18 standard deviation decline in reading comprehension scores. However, the minimum wage’s effect on children from high-socioeconomic households is not statistically different from zero.====Interpreting the results from a child-fixed effects model as causal requires an identifying assumption that unobserved heterogeneities that determine the minimum wage and children’s educational outcomes jointly are time-invariant. It is certainly possible that states raise the minimum wage when the unemployment rate is low and this identifying assumption may not hold. To address this concern, I augment my empirical specification, comparing children from low-socioeconomic households with those from high-socioeconomic households. The underlying assumption of this model is that omitted factors that jointly determine the minimum wage and other variables influencing children’s educational outcomes affect the children from low- and high-socioeconomic households in a similar way. Estimates show that a $1 minimum wage increase reduces children’s math and reading scores by approximately 0.10–0.19 standard deviations. They provide further evidence that a minimum wage increase has a negative and statistically significant effect on children’s math and reading achievement. I find qualitatively similar results when I employ a specification that uses variation in the minimum wage within commuting zones (CZs).====Finally, I use an alternative definition of the treatment group. I calculate parents’ hourly wages in the previous calendar year, separately, dividing their total annual incomes by annual hours worked. In the spirit of Aaronson et al. (2012) and Dettling and Hsu (2017), I define the treatment group as those children, one or both of whose parents are minimum wage workers, such that either parent has earnings in the range of 60% to 120% of the effective minimum wage.==== I use the data in a cross-sectional format. The results show a statistically significant and negative effect of the minimum wage on children’s test scores.====To understand the potential mechanism through which the minimum wage operates to affect children’s test scores adversely, I examine the link between the minimum wage and the home environment. I use three measures of the home environment, which are available in the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult data. The scores are calculated based on numerous questions pertaining to support and resources for a child at home, which could serve as inputs in children’s cognitive development and academic achievement. I find negative and significant effects on the home environment for children with low socioeconomic status, demonstrating that a higher minimum wage leads to a deteriorating home environment for a child. However, the effects on the home environment of children with high socioeconomic status are not statistically different from zero. To shed further light on why the minimum wage leads to an adverse home environment for the low-socioeconomic status children, I show that an increase in the minimum wage lowers the probability that both parents eat with their child at least once a day and that parents encourage a child to pursue hobbies. These findings suggest that parental time investment in children declines with a rise in the minimum wage. For those individuals who have minimum-wage jobs, a higher minimum wage may decrease the quality of their jobs, such as a decline in fringe benefits and a rise in irregular scheduling (Wessels, 1980 and McKenzie, 1980) and a decline in employer provided health coverage (Clemens et al., 2018). For those who lose their jobs following a minimum wage hike, the perilous of joblessness is expected to affect the home environment adversely.====By showing that the effects of minimum wage changes come to affect children’s cognitive achievement, this paper makes a novel contribution to the minimum wage literature. Despite the minimum wage literature being expansive, the literature does not provide evidence on an important margin of family well-being which is children’s achievement. The literature that examines the link between the minimum wage and other unintended outcomes is closest to this paper, such as the uptake of other social welfare programs, teens’ educational outcomes, and birth weight.====This paper complements the literature studying the short-term effects of social welfare programs on child development. Dahl and Lochner (2012) examine the effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on children’s math and reading ability in the United States, using similar data as in this analysis. They find a positive effect. Milligan and Stabile (2011), who investigate the effects of income transfer programs in Canada, show positive impacts of such programs on children’s test scores and mental health. Likewise, Regmi (2019) provides evidence of a positive link between the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits and children’s education in the United States. The central message of my analysis is that unlike government transfer programs, the minimum wage lowers children’s human capital accumulation. The disparate effects of the minimum wage and other social welfare programs may be attributable to the fact that they have different consequences for the workers affected. Government transfer programs that provide financial support, while the government receives no service in return, are generally intended to shield individuals temporarily against negative shocks in the labor market. On the other hand, the minimum wage has been shown to generate negative effects for low-skilled workers with respect to employment opportunities (e.g, Neumark, Salas, Wascher, 2014, Meer, West, 2016, and Clemens and Wither, 2019).====The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 presents a conceptual framework to show potential channels between the minimum wage and children’s cognitive achievement. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 the empirical specification. I present the results in Section 5 and provide the robustness of the main findings in Section 6. I explain potential mechanisms in Section 7.

Based on our lab experiment with randomised CVs, we confirm the role of appearance on job recruitment. Importantly, we show that appearance of other applicants with the same gender has significant incremental effects on top of the existing beauty premium. This “wingman effect” is more pronounced in high skilled occupations and mainly among male recruiters. We provide evidence that the “wingman effect” is not driven by system one decision making and predominantly affects choices at the margin.","Does your appearance affect your earnings and career prospects? Hamermesh and Biddle (1994) were the first to use a nationally representative data set in the 1970s to estimate the effect of beauty on earnings in the US. They show that being rated as below average was associated with a wage penalty of 4% for women and 13% for men, while those with above average beauty received 8% and 4% in wage gain for women and men respectively. Therefore a shift in beauty rating from below average to above average is comparable to having an additional one and a half years of schooling.====Productive characteristics of appearance can only explain a fraction of the beauty premium in the labour market. Self-selection into occupations by appearance might arise for some occupations where workers have direct contact with customers or have to appear in public such as lawyers and salespersons. For example, using data of graduates from one law school, Biddle and Hamermesh (1998) showed that better-looking attorneys were more likely to work in private sector (where the interaction with clients, judges, and juries is higher). Hence, they earned more and the effect increased with experience. Yet some studies document a significant return to beauty in occupations where the productivity of appearance should be less pronounced such as American footballers and economics professors (see Hamermesh, 2011 for an extensive review).====One explanation for observing beauty premiums across all types of occupations is labour market discrimination against the less beautiful. On the one hand, the source of such prejudice might come from employer, employee, or customer discrimination. On the other hand, employers or recruiters have incomplete information about some unobservable characteristics of the applicant and hence they have to form some beliefs about such characteristics based on the “perceived” average of the group, which the applicant belongs to, such as ethnicity, or appearance (Altonji and Blank, 1999).====However, to estimate causal effects of appearance on labour market outcomes, researchers would ideally like to observe such outcomes of two groups which are the same in every aspect except for appearance. One technique to circumvent this issue is called “correspondence testing”. It explores the discrimination at the very first stage of getting into the labour market, i.e. the chance of being called back for a job interview (see, for example Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004). The researcher has to create fake CVs and allocate the characteristic of interest such as appearance at random to each CV. On average, the CVs of these groups should be comparable in every observed characteristic except for their beauty.====Other than the beauty of oneself, does the appearance of other candidates influence the decision of recruiters or employers? Research studies in psychology, behavioural science, and marketing have shown that the preference ranking between two options in a choice set, which do not dominate another option in all dimensions, can be altered by adding irrelevant alternatives to the choice set. In the paradigm of asymmetrically dominated alternatives (Huber et al., 1982), the third alternative is constructed so that it is inferior (in every dimension) to one option but not the other one (Ariely and Wallsten, 1995). Hence, it is barely chosen as the best option. Yet the presence of this third alternative does influence the ranking between the other two relevant options, therefore, it is called a decoy.====Despite extensive research on the decoy effect in consumer research and marketing (see, for example Brenner, Rottenstreich, Sood, 1999, Lichters, Sarstedt, Vogt, 2015, Slaughter, Kausel, Quiñones, 2011), this concept has been popularised and extended to dating and intimate relationships, for example, in TED talk by Dan Ariely.==== He claimed that when one goes out bar-hopping, one will be more likely to be chosen for a date if he or she takes a friend, who looks similar to that person but slightly uglier, with him or her. This idea was dubbed as a wingman story. The wingman is the person who helps his or her friend to gain access to a romantic relationship or to avoid attention from whom they have no romantic interest. However, is this wingman concept with the decoy tweak applicable to the context outside of romantic relationships?====This paper combines a laboratory experiment with a randomised CV approach to assess the effects of own appearance and the beauty composition of candidates for the same job simultaneously. Even though existing literature used correspondence testing to analyse the role of body weight (Rooth, 2009) and the beauty premium (Kraft, 2012), field experiments with faked CVs do not allow researchers to control for beauty composition in the pool of applicants. We recruited students from local universities to participate in an experiment where they were asked to select applicants for an interview of fictitious positions from the pool of candidates whose CVs were randomised in every characteristic including their appearance. Further, we can control for personal characteristics of the “recruiters” and track the time our student participants used to evaluate the characteristics and photo page. We compute a relative time that the participant used on the photo page and use it as a proxy for “relative attention” to each photo in the job opening. Despite some applications in business and psychology, to the best of our knowledge, this experiment is the first to use such time-tracking technique together with the correspondence testing.====Our findings confirm that better-looking applicants get higher chances to be selected in all types of occupations, particularly in high-skilled jobs. This finding can reject neither productivity hypothesis of beauty nor taste based discrimination. Yet a larger effect of beauty in high skilled occupations supports a narrative of employee discrimination because in this sector our student participants could relate the applicants as their future co-workers. The effect of appearance is significantly higher if recruiters and candidates are of the opposite gender. With regards to beauty composition, we construct a wingman variable as an average beauty rating of other same-gender job applicants in the same job opening. Such a wingman effect is important in high-skilled jobs and jobs with customer contact. Arguably, candidates that are relatively more beautiful may help to increase sales in occupations with direct customer contact; however, the wingman effect in high-skilled sectors still supports the employee-based discrimination narrative. This finding provides evidence for the decoy effect in the context of job application. Thus, an extrapolation from our findings suggests that one can raise one’s chance to get a job by asking his or her less attractive friend(s), who are similar in other characteristics, to apply for the same job.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 explains the experimental design, Section 3 presents our methodology, Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes; Figures and Tables are included in the Appendix.",Your wingman could help you land a job: How beauty composition of applicants affects the call-back probability,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300610,4 June 2020,2020,Research Article,281.0

Although the maximum duration is the same for all unemployed, potential benefit duration at the beginning of unemployment spells varies, because only claimants with sufficient work history qualify for a new benefit period, whereas others may be entitled to residual benefits from the previous spell. Part of this variation is exogenous due to a reform that reduced the minimum number of employment weeks required for a new benefit period. Using a fuzzy difference-in-differences approach we estimate that one extra week of benefits increases expected unemployment duration by 0.16 weeks. A longer benefit period also increases the expected wage and duration of the next job. The relative importance of the match-quality effect is economically significant when the fiscal impacts of benefit duration changes are considered.","One of the key questions in the unemployment insurance (UI) literature is how the length of the benefit period affects the duration of unemployment spells and the quality of subsequent job matches. A major challenge of causal inference is to find exogenous variation in the length of the benefit period. The most convincing studies have relied either on discontinuities in the benefit rule that determines the maximum benefit duration as a function of age and/or work history (e.g. Caliendo, Tatsiramos, Uhlendorff, 2013, Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007, Lalive, 2007, Lalive, 2008, Le Barbanchon, 2016, Schmieder, von Wachter, Bender, 2012) or policy changes that extended or reduced the benefit period for some group of the unemployed but did not affect other groups (e.g. Hunt, 1995, Lalive, Ours, Zweimüller, 2006, van Ours, Vodopivec, 2006). The regression discontinuity approach can be applied only in the case of certain countries where the maximum benefit duration varies across worker groups (e.g. Germany, Austria, Italy and Portugal).==== A common problem with the policy reforms is that the benefit periods are often extended in response to recessions (e.g. the federal- and state-level benefit extension programs in the U.S.) or to the relatively poor employment development of certain worker groups, so that the policy changes themselves are endogenous (Card, Levine, 2000, Lalive, Zweimüller, 2004). Large-scale reforms may also have spillover effects on those who are not directly affected through search externalities (Lalive, Landais, Zweimüller, 2015, Levine, 1993). In the case of Finland, neither of these approaches can be applied as the maximum duration of UI benefits remained at 100 weeks for several decades up until 2013.==== In this paper, we propose and apply a novel approach to estimate the causal effects of potential benefit duration in the absence of variation in the maximum benefit period.====In Finland, an unemployed worker who has worked for a certain minimum number of weeks during the past two years is awarded a new period of UI benefits (500 payment days or 100 calendar weeks prior to 2014). A worker who enters unemployment without satisfying this employment condition may still be entitled to UI benefits if he or she has some residual benefits left from the previous unemployment spell. Within this group the remaining benefit entitlement can be anything between 1 and 499 payment days. Thus, even though the ==== entitlement period is the same for all unemployed, there is variation in ==== benefit duration at the beginning of unemployment spells among workers with different employment histories.==== Obviously this variation alone does not permit causal inference, as it is completely driven by differences in past labor market outcomes.====To identify the causal effects, we take advantage of a change in the employment condition in 2003 that reduced the minimum number of employment weeks required for renewal of the entitlement period. As a result of the reform, workers who satisfied the new but not the old employment condition became eligible for UI benefits for different periods of time depending on the date of their unemployment entry, whereas other workers were not affected by the reform. Provided that the change in the employment condition did not affect the unemployment inflow, the resulting variation in the potential benefit duration within the affected group is exogenous, and thus the causal effects of potential benefit duration can be identified by comparing different groups before and after the 2003 reform. Since the reform only affected a relatively small fraction of all UI recipients, we should not worry about the confounding spillover effects.====We classify workers who became unemployed between 2000 and 2004 into groups defined by the number of employment weeks and the number of residual UI days from the previous spell. These groups were affected differently by the 2003 change in the employment condition. The groups where employment weeks exceed the new but not the old threshold of the employment condition are the most likely to experience a notable increase in potential benefit duration after 2003. Moreover, within these groups, the average increase in potential benefit duration is larger for those with fewer residual benefit days from the previous spell. Under the assumption that the expected value of unobserved characteristics in different groups follows the same trend, we can estimate the effects of potential benefit duration by comparing changes in the unemployment outcomes over time across different groups.====Our findings indicate that one additional week of UI benefits increases the expected duration of compensated unemployment by some 0.16 weeks, corresponding to an elasticity of 0.5. This effect appears to be fairly homogeneous, as the absolute effect varies between 0.10 and 0.22 weeks across various subgroups of workers. The effect is quite similar for women and men, for different education groups, for private- and public-sector employees, and for those facing different labor market conditions. However, workers aged 45 and over, those with relatively high UI benefits and those with fewer residual days from the previous unemployment spell are somewhat more responsive to changes in the potential benefit duration. Furthermore, we find evidence that longer benefit periods improve the quality of the first post-unemployment job: one additional week of benefits is estimated to increase the expected wage and duration of the next job by some 2 Euros per month and 0.14–0.18 weeks, respectively. The former effect corresponds to an elasticity of 0.06, whereas the latter effect is economically more significant with an elasticity of around 0.2. The effect on the quality of the next job varies across groups, being close to zero in many cases. Women, low educated and private-sector employees are the most likely to benefit in terms of higher wages or more stable jobs from the longer job search periods that longer benefit periods enable. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations imply that the match-quality effect has a significant fiscal impact: better job matches following a benefit duration extension may increase tax revenues and social security contributions over post-unemployment job spells by an amount that accounts for two-thirds of the direct costs of longer unemployment spells.====Our study makes three contributions. First, we show that it may be possible to estimate the causal effects of potential benefit duration even when there is no variation in the maximum benefit duration. In most countries, benefit eligibility depends on the record of past employment and awarded benefits can be collected over several unemployment spells. In these cases, the econometric approach we propose here can be applied. Second, we provide first evidence on the effect of potential benefit duration on unemployment duration for Finland. Tatsiramos and van Ours (2014) summarize the findings of the previous studies for other countries by concluding that a one-week increase in potential benefit duration typically prolongs average unemployment duration by approximately 0.2 weeks. Although our approach differs from the previous studies, which have exploited variation in the maximum benefit duration, our estimate for Finland is of the same magnitude. Third, our study contributes to a modest literature on the effect of potential benefit duration on the quality of subsequent job matches. Most studies in this literature find either a small negative effect or no effect at all on measures of job quality (e.g. Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007, Lalive, 2007, Le Barbanchon, 2016, Schmieder, von Wachter, Bender, 2016). A notable exception is Nekoei and Weber (2017) who find a small positive wage effect but no effect on subsequent job duration in Austria.==== Our results of positive impacts on the match quality are encouraging, given that they suggest that the Finnish UI scheme does not only subsidize leisure time but also productive job search.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the Finnish UI system during the period under investigation. This is followed by a section describing our data and sample restrictions.

Research proposes that this effect is exceptionally strong for early childbearing women who are about to start their working careers. This study investigates whether the poor long-term labor market outcomes experienced by women who first gave birth before turning 25 reflect previously existing disadvantages or are a consequence of the timing of childbearing. The purpose is also to observe whether a new combination of the best identification practices from earlier studies serves as an improved estimation method. This is done by applying a within-family estimator while treating miscarriages as an exogenous variation, thereby addressing family and individual heterogeneity, which might have biased earlier results based on either of the two identification strategies alone. The results show that early childbearing has no long-term effects on ====.","Estimating the causal effect of early childbearing on women's labor market outcomes is a long-standing challenge for researchers. Early childbearing is often perceived as both a social and an economic problem, creating challenges for both society and the mother in question. There is a widespread belief that early childbearing is negatively correlated with women's educational attainment, employment prospects, and lifetime earnings. In this study, early childbearing is defined as giving birth to a child before turning 25.==== However, the results are robust to younger threshold ages, including 21 or younger, at first childbirth. I investigate whether the long-term socioeconomic problems experienced by early childbearing women reflect already-existing disadvantages or are a consequence of the timing of childbearing. I find short-lived negative effects of early childbearing, but in contrast to common belief, I find no evidence that early childbearing has long-term negative effects on women's earnings.====To perform my analysis, I examine the full population of Danish mothers over the period 1980 to 2014. It is commonly expected that the opportunity costs of early motherhood in the Scandinavian welfare state model are low relative to countries providing less social welfare. Nonetheless, studies in a Scandinavian context have found non-trivial earnings penalties for early childbearing women (e.g., Holmlund, 2005; Mølland, 2016; and Johansen et al., 2019). Leung et al. (2016) study the full Danish population and find that women having their first child before turning 25 suffer from significant lifetime labor income loss. It is therefore an ongoing puzzle whether the negative effects of early childbearing are caused by the timing of childbearing or by selection, even in the Scandinavian countries.====The advantages of the Danish data are threefold. First, the data are register-based, which makes it possible to observe the entire population of Danish mothers to obtain a very large panel. Second, the data include a large number of demographic, educational, income, labor market, and health variables, which makes it possible to control for a large set of important confounding factors. The detailed health registers provide an especially strong advantage to the identification strategy outlined below by distinguishing terminated pregnancies as miscarriages or induced abortions. Third, the administration of the registers’ historical information is highly reliable.====These features make it possible to analyze the impact of early childbearing in a novel way by combining two strong identification strategies, each designed to identify causal effects of early childbearing on adult labor market outcomes in different ways. Some previous studies use a within-family estimator to account for family heterogeneity (Geronimus & Korenman, 1992; Hoffman et al., 1993; Ribar, 1999; Holmlund, 2005; Diaz & Fiel, 2017; and Johansen et al., 2018). Others treat miscarriages as an exogenous variation in women's childbirth timing (Hotz et al., 1997; Ashcraft et al., 2013; Fletcher & Wolfe, 2009; Ermisch, 2003; Goodman et al., 2004; and Miller, 2011). This paper constructs three samples to compare and implement both strategies and evaluate whether a combination of the two serves as a better estimation method.====The first sample consists of early and non-early childbearing sisters. The second sample consists of early childbearing women and non-early childbearing women who were also pregnant early but whose first childbirth was delayed due to a miscarriage. These samples are constructed to replicate earlier studies and to examine whether the same results can be obtained with data for Danish women. The results for both suggest that early childbearing has a significant negative effect on earnings and educational attainment.====The third sample is a combination of the first two. It consists of early childbearing women and their non-early childbearing sisters who were also pregnant early but their first childbirth was delayed due to miscarriage. The negative effects of early childbearing on earnings disappear in the long run, and the effect on education diminishes substantially when a sister fixed-effect estimator is applied using sisters who miscarried at an early age.====These results show the advantages of this novel combination of identification strategies, which eliminates the potential biases each strategy faces when applied on its own. Even though sisters share backgrounds, adolescence, and genes, there may remain some unobserved heterogeneity between early childbearing women and their non-early childbearing sisters, as birth timing is highly endogenous to individual features. On the other hand, even though miscarriages are highly random and delay childbirth, they are not entirely unbiased to biological and social features. I incorporate a detailed health variable to address the biological bias. Aschraft et al. (2013) show that socially disadvantaged women have a higher risk of miscarrying even after health is controlled for, which suggests that studies using miscarriages for exogenous variation without further controls for family heterogeneities may also be biased.====A combination of the two identification strategies addresses these biases. The use of a sister fixed-effect estimator adds to the validity of treating miscarriages as an exogenous variation by addressing the heterogeneity in social economic and family backgrounds between miscarrying and non-miscarrying women. Together with controlling for the possible negative correlations between health and miscarriages, this arguably produces a better causal estimate of the effect of early childbearing on adult labor market outcomes.====The main result of this study is that early childbearing has no persistent effect on women's earnings, which suggests that the observed inferior earnings of early childbearing women are due not to early childbearing but to pre-existing disadvantages in ability and social factors. This paper thus makes two contributions. The first is methodological, as it shows that the existing commonly applied estimators may be prone to bias and that a combination of these estimators serves as a better estimation method. The second is the result that early childbearing does not need to have long-term effects for women in Denmark, a country with strong public welfare institutions.====The paper proceeds as follows.

Considering two popular methods, the results are ambiguous: We find that using LASSO based logit models to estimate the propensity score delivers more credible results than conventional methods in small and medium sized high dimensional datasets. However, the usage of Random Forests to estimate the propensity score may lead to a deterioration of the performance in situations with a low treatment share. The application reveals a positive effect of the training programme on days in employment for long-term unemployed. While the choice of the “first stage” is highly relevant for settings with low number of observations and few treated, machine learning and conventional estimation becomes more similar in larger samples and higher treatment shares.","A long and ongoing literature is concerned with the evaluation of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in a selection-on-observables setting. Propensity score (PS) based matching-type estimators are the established econometric workhorse in this literature (e.g., Imbens, 2004, 2015; Smith and Todd, 2005; Wunsch and Lechner, 2008; Lechner and Wunsch, 2009, 2013; Biewen, Fitzenberger, Osikominu, and Paul, 2014; Doerr, Fitzenberger, Kruppe, Paul, and Strittmatter, 2017; Caliendo, Mahlstedt, and Mitnik, 2017; Calónico and Smith, 2017; the meta study of Card, Kluve, and Weber, 2018, and references therein). A common issue in PS-based methods is the concrete specification of the PS. The past and current literature usually estimated the PS using a parametric model, i.e. Probit or Logit. Covariates and functional forms were commonly chosen in a fairly ad-hoc manner based on monitoring the balancing properties of the resulting estimated PS (compare Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1984; Dehejia and Wahba, 2002).====The emerging literature in statistical learning, might help to make this specification less ad-hoc.==== In this paper, we investigate if machine learning methods can improve average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) estimation when used to predict the PS. Estimating the PS used in matching-type estimators with machine learning could help in three ways: 1) detecting variables of the selection process that might otherwise be omitted by the researchers, but are available in the data; 2) allowing for the appropriate degree of functional flexibility in the PS; 3) increasing the precision of the estimate by avoiding overfitting of the PS. These issues become more relevant with the increased availability of rich-covariate “big data” datasets, the handling of which requires suitable methods.====Although off-the-shelf machine learning methods have many well-documented advantages in prediction and classification, it is not obvious that using them for propensity score estimation in a matching framework will improve the estimation of causal effects. One potential reason is that they aim at a different target (compare Athey and Imbens, 2019). The goal of using a PS in matching estimation is to balance the covariate distribution of treated and non-treated units to obtain a quasi-experimental situation. Machine learning algorithms, if used for PS estimation, follow the goal to predict treatment participation given the covariates, as good as possible, by trading off bias and variance in out-of-sample comparisons. One example for why this may be a bad idea are covariates that are very good predictors of outcome but only weakly correlated with treatment assignment (compare e.g. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014). Since machine learning algorithms try to maximize predictive power (in a mean square error sense), they may omit such variables as they do not help much to predict the treatment, accepting a somewhat larger bias in the propensity score that is dominated by the resulting variance reduction. However, since these now-omitted variables are important predictors of the outcome, the small bias in the propensity score may translate to a large one in the ATET estimation.====While there are already some implementations of the idea of estimating the PS used in matching-type estimators with machine learning procedures (e.g. Krumer and Lechner, 2018; Goller and Krumer, 2019) there is little evidence on whether such an estimator actually has favourable finite sample properties. In early papers, Setoguchi, Schneeweiss, Brookhart, Glynn, and Cook (2008) and Lee, Lessler, and Stuart (2010) investigated the performance of machine learning methods for estimating the PS. Those papers based their simulations on a data generating process (DGP) which might be well suited for their targeted applications in the medical context. They found machine learning predictions to outperform the parametric baseline methods. Pirrachio, Petersen, and van der Laan (2015), and Cannas and Arpino (2019) used the same specifications as the two above-mentioned papers and found the Super Learner (van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard, 2007) and the Random Forest, respectively, to perform best, while the other machine learning techniques did not work sufficiently well in terms of bias in PS matching. As these four studies used the same data generating process based on only ten covariates and a treatment share of 50 percent, they might be less informative for microeconometric applications in which the dimension of confounders is usually much higher and the treatment shares very likely to deviate from 50 percent.====In another recent work, Brown, Merrigan, and Royer (2018). evaluated machine learning PS estimation techniques in a simulation study. In particular, they found that ====east ====bsolute ====hrinkage and ====election ====perator (LASSO), Boosting and Deep Learning outperformed the Random Forest and the baseline approach in terms of bias in their simulations. While they based the simulations on a high-dimensional empirical dataset with a low share of treated, this is only partially related to our question as they focus on using the PS as covariate in a Cox Proportional Hazard Model.====Hill, Weiss, and Zhai (2011) investigated a high-dimensional empirical problem and discussed strategies and challenges to understand which PS method to use. They illustrated the various potential strategies and the resulting wide range of different estimates, highly depending on the choice of the empirical researcher. As they did not observe the true effect, they were not able to point out which strategies worked best in their setup.====In conclusion, there is only limited practical advice from the existing literature on how to improve PS estimation with the goal of ‘better’ treatment effect estimation. Thus, our work contributes to the literature in evaluating the performance of classical and machine learning based PS estimators for matching-type estimators in a realistic labour market setting.====To be as close as possible to a real situation empirical researchers might face, we use a rich administrative dataset of German long-term unemployed persons in an Empirical Monte Carlo Simulation (EMCS), as suggested by Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013) and Lechner and Wunsch (2013). Furthermore, we compare the different estimators in a real programme evaluation application.====Our database consists of a large sample of German unemployed means-tested benefit recipients at the end of 2009, most of them long-term unemployed, including all individuals participating in a specific training programme in the first quarter of 2010. There is a broad range of characteristics recorded for each individual, which includes all the quantifiable information relevant for the case-workers’ decision to send the respective individual to a training programme or not.====We evaluate the effect of a training programme and simulate the performance of different PS estimators, using the radius matching on the propensity score with bias adjustment (RMBA) algorithm developed in Lechner, Miquel, and Wunsch (2011), which performed best in the simulation of Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013). To be more precise, we use two different machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest and LASSO to estimate the PS. We choose these two as they use very different approaches in a non-parametric sense: Random Forest approximate the PS locally, similar to non-parametric regression, while LASSO with many polynomials and interaction term will approximate the PS with a flexible global function, e.g. similar to series estimation.==== In that sense, they represent two very different types of approaches. A large literature discusses both methods, establishing theoretical properties (e.g. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2009), as well as modifying them for usage in other types of causal inference problems (e.g. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014; Wager and Athey, 2018; Lechner, 2018; Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager, 2019). We compare these two estimators to the true, a random, and a PS based on a parametric ad-hoc (Probit) model, which we then use for estimating the ATET in the RMBA estimator.====Our findings are mixed. LASSO performs well as PS estimator for the usage in radius matching especially in situations in which using Probit and Random Forest do not deliver credible estimates. When there are many covariates compared to observations, Probit does not work well; once the number of observations increases sufficiently, Probit and LASSO perform equally well. Random Forest tends to predict the treatment in sample well, but does not work properly as balancing score estimator. If the share of treated units is low, the Random Forest cannot manage to split deep enough to estimate a PS flexible enough to remove the selection bias. In fact, we find that PS estimated with Random Forest may lead to comparing control units and treated units, which are not sufficiently similar. Thus, whether using specific off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms does help depends on the context of the application. Since knowing which of the methods works a priori appears to be difficult, a plausible alternative is to use Causal Machine Learning methods instead, e.g. ‘double machine learning’ suggested by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) or the Modified Causal Forest suggested by Lechner (2018), that are optimized specifically for treatment effect estimation (for an overview see e.g. Knaus, Lechner, Strittmatter, 2018).====The empirical application that we conducted reflects the sensitivity to method choice. While all methods lead to a positive effect of the training programme, the effects based on PS estimated by Random Forests are about 30 percent larger compared to the estimates using LASSO or Probit as PS estimator.====The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: In Sections 2 and 3, we describe the institutional background and the database used for the simulation and application in detail. Section 4 introduces the EMCS, as well as the estimators used. Sections 5 and 6 present the results of the simulations and the empirical application. Section 7 concludes.

In the setting of a British University where assignment to seminars is plausibly exogenous, we define two measures of classroom composition: the share of non-native speakers and the linguistic diversity of the non-speaker group. Non-native speaker’s performance benefits from greater linguistic diversity. Native speakers are unaffected by classroom composition. Survey information points to changed interaction patterns in the classroom as a likely mechanism. While ethno-linguistic seminar composition has no meaningful impact on subsequent course choice, the effect of initial diversity on grades persists until the final year of study. The results imply that avoiding segregation along language lines is key in providing education for an international student body.","The fast-paced internationalisation of the tertiary education system has drastically increased the number of international students from 2.0 million in 2000 to 5.3 million worldwide in 2017.==== The UK is one of the largest recipient countries of foreign students. In 2019, it hosted about 486,000 international students, representing 25% of the student population in the country.==== The increasingly diverse student population has sparked a scientific and political debate. Advocates of internationalisation argue that increasing diversity benefits both native and foreign students, while critics raise concerns about potential negative spill-overs and native college flight. Empirical evidence on the effects of increasing numbers of foreign students is mostly restricted to primary and secondary education and points to ambiguous effects across different settings.==== Tertiary education settings have received less attention to date.====In this paper, we provide causal evidence on the effects of higher internationalisation and ethnic diversity on student grades and educational choices in a setting of exogeneous assignment to undergraduate seminars at a British university. We measure the ethnic composition of a seminar (small-scale learning group) by the share of non-native language background (labeled as the share of non-native speakers hereafter) but also by the ethno-linguistic diversity within the group of non-native speakers.====Ethno-linguistic diversity among non-native students is expected to influence student performance and choices as it changes incentives for English language use and assimilation, a mechanism that is straightforwardly derived from a model of language assimilation (Lazear, 1999). At a given share of non-native speakers, a non-native-speaking student from a smaller linguistic minority broadens her pool of potential learning partners if she communicates in English, albeit potentially at some cost. The smaller the pool of potential same-language learning partners, the higher the incentives to engage in English communication. This intuition directly maps into a theoretically-positive effect of diversity on classroom integration which in turn is expected to have positive spill-overs on the academic performance of non-native speakers. Further, language skills acquired through interaction with native peers can directly improve performance in English curricula, even in quantitative courses. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the effect of ethnic seminar diversity (beyond the simple share of immigrants) on student outcomes in a tertiary education setting.====We base our analysis on the administrative records of economics students at a university in the London Metropolitan area. This institutional environment provides a fitting “laboratory setting” for our analysis for two reasons. First, the student body that we analyse is characterised by a high degree of ethno-linguistic diversity. Over the 2006 to 2016 period, we observe on average a share of 56 percent of non-native students from 67 different non-English-speaking countries. The high degree of ethno-linguistic diversity ensures a sufficient common support for the share of non-native students and the diversity to identify the causal effect of both variables. This level of internationalisation is shared by other British institutions, and the institution that we analyse does not stand out in terms of selectivity or graduate earnings. Second, students of the economics programme are exogeneously allocated to seminars during the compulsory stage of their studies, which results in an exogenously varying ethno-linguistic composition that is consistent with an as-good-as-random assignment to seminars.====We describe three sets of results. First, grades of native speakers are unaffected by the share of non-native students and the linguistic diversity of a classroom. Non-native speakers are not penalised by higher shares of non-native students in the classroom, but benefit from a higher ethno-linguistic diversity. In a more diverse classroom, the academic performance of non-native speakers improves, especially for low-achieving students.====Second, we trace potential mechanisms through an in-class survey. Students change their pattern of classroom interaction across ethnicities in response to higher diversity. When diversity increases, non-native students become more likely to interact with native students while interaction patterns for native speakers remain unaltered. Diversity appears to counteract segregation between native and non-native speakers.====Third, in the longer run the initial share of non-native speakers increases the likelihood to choose courses that are again popular among non-native students. This segregation into courses, potentially, better suited for non-native students, might explain the persistent effect of share of non-native speakers on third year performance which is to some degree inconsistent with the contemporary results. With respect to early seminar diversity, and in line with contemporary results, though, third year grades are positively affected, suggesting some persistence of the contemporary effect of diversity on performance. Finally, a voluntary alumni survey suggests that being assigned to a larger share of non-native students in the compulsory stage increases the likelihood of non-native speakers to be abroad at the point of interview of the post-graduation survey.====Taken together, our findings suggest that even at a high level of internationalisation, there are virtually no negative effects on the learning of native students through the exposure to non-native speakers in small-class teaching. Diversity improves the learning of non-native speakers while natives speakers’ performance remains unaffected.====With this paper, we contribute to the literature on the effects of the internationalisation of education. In general, existing studies have focused on the share of foreign students in primary and secondary school classrooms. Ballatore et al. (2018) exploit rules of classroom formation to identify a sizeable negative effect of additional immigrant students in Italian primary schools, which are substantially larger for foreign rather than native students. Other studies describe small negative to zero to even slight positive effects of higher shares of foreign students using variation between cohorts or classes of the same school (Diette, Oyelere, 2017, Figlio, Özek, 2017, Frattini, Meschi, 2017, Geay, McNally, Telhaj, 2013, Gould, Lavy, Paserman, 2009, Ohinata, van Ours, 2013), regions (Hunt, 2017, Jensen, Rasmussen, 2011, McHenry, 2015) or between countries (Brunello and Rocco, 2013). With respect to diversity of primary/secondary school classrooms, Maestri (2017) finds a positive effect of more diverse classrooms on foreigners language acquisition, while Bredtmann et al. (2018) report negative correlations between diversity and the social integration of immigrants in German primary schools.====Only few studies have estimated the effects of internationalisation in tertiary education settings. Anelli et al. (2017) show that higher shares of foreign peers in introductory maths courses reduces the probability of native students moving into STEM majors, but find no direct effect on grades. Compared to our own study, their interest is on the effect of internationalisation on major choice in a US public university. In our setting, as common in European universities, students have already chosen their major at enrolment, and as such follow more comparable educational paths. Braakmann and McDonald (2018) describe a relationship between diversity at the course level and student performance for three UK-wide cohorts and deal with potentially endogenous course choices by exploiting within-programme variation across courses. They complement their main analysis with an IV strategy relying on network effects among foreign students. Their results point to ambiguous effects of diversity, depending on the level of analysis. Machin and Murphy (2017) find no evidence for a crowding out of domestic students in response to higher influx of foreign students in UK universities.====Our paper makes three contributions to these strands of literature. First, we examine the effect of diversity in higher education beyond the simple share of foreign students on a fine-grained seminar level. These seminars display relevant peer groups with meaningful social interactions. While Braakmann and McDonald (2018) demonstrate sensitivity of the level of observation with respect to student diversity, the classroom level has only been addressed by Maestri (2017) for primary school classrooms in the Netherlands and by Bredtmann et al. (2018) for German primary schools. Second, whereas the aforementioned studies have to deal with potential selection into classrooms and programs, we base our identification on a clean natural experiment relying on as-good-as-random allocation of students to small-scale seminars. This strategy alleviates many concerns about potential confounders through the selection of students into seminars. Third, we provide insights into plausible mechanisms by surveying students in the field about ethnic interactions and language use.====Our results have implications for education practitioners. Even in an environment where non-native speakers represent more than half of the students, we do not find negative effects of their share on the performance and educational choices of native students. This supports current policies of pursuing greater internationalisation in higher education and should caution against forces asking for stricter admission policies discriminating by origin. Moreover, to favour the integration of non-native speakers, diversifying early study environments by avoiding segregated classrooms appears to be a low-cost way to improve the educational performance of lower ability non-native-speaking students.====Beyond the educational setting, our results may speak to the effect of diversity in work-related settings, where existing literature has not yet reached a consensus about the effects of diversity on productivity (Dale-Olsen, Finseraas, 2019, Hoogendoorn, Van Praag, 2012, Kahane, Longley, Simmons, 2013, Trax, Brunow, Suedekum, 2015). Here, we provide complementary findings from “academic work groups” and show that higher levels of diversity indeed provide the potential to raise productivity and knowledge production.","Peer diversity, college performance and educational choices",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300385,26 May 2020,2020,Research Article,285.0

By using a difference-in-differences estimator, we find an instantaneous increase of about 12% in the layoff probability when unemployment benefit eligibility is attained, which persists for at least 16 weeks. These findings are robust to different identifying assumptions and are mostly driven by jobs started after the onset of the ==== and in the South.","The main purpose of unemployment insurance (UI) is to provide income support during unemployment in case of job loss. The design of UI, however, entails a trade-off between insurance and incentives. This may lead to a moral hazard problem, which induces the insured unemployed to search less intensively. The empirical literature has extensively analysed the effect of unemployment benefits (UBs) on unemployment spell duration.==== The results generally show that the generosity of UB prolongs unemployment duration, suggesting that the insured unemployed may behave opportunistically while searching for jobs.====Beyond its well-known effects during unemployment, UI may induce a moral hazard behaviour in both employers and employees, which can alter job separation rates. On the demand side, firms may have an incentive to exploit the UI system to adjust their workforce in case of negative demand shocks (Feldstein, 1976). On the supply side, workers may have a preference for leisure combined with UB compensation. In this case, they have an incentive to work just long enough to attain UB eligibility and then exit employment. In this paper, we aim to estimate the causal effect of UB eligibility on layoff probability and to provide some insight on the role of the employer and employee’s moral hazard. Our contribution to the literature is twofold.====First, we bring new evidence by exploiting quasi-experimental variation in UB eligibility conditions in Italy. In contrast to the empirical literature on unemployment duration, the effects of UI on layoffs have indeed received little attention.==== The analysis relies on an inflow sample of more than 400,000 new jobs drawn from administrative registries covering the period of 2005 to 2012, which we follow until job separation. We identify the impact of attaining UB eligibility by exploiting two eligibility conditions in the Italian UI system: i) at least 52 working weeks in the last two calendar years and ii) at least one day of work ==== this two-year horizon. Identifying the effect of UI eligibility is challenging since it is confounded by the effect of work experience accumulated along the job spell. To control for this confounder, we add a control group of workers who cannot attain UB eligibility despite accumulating the same level of work experience over the last two years. This allows us to carry out a duration analysis in a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator framework.====Second, we provide evidence that the impact of UB eligibility on layoffs in Italy is not homogeneous across regions, despite these being characterised by the same labour market institutions. We focus on the geographical dimension that is related to the puzzling and long-lasting North–South divide in Italy. Our conjecture is that a higher unemployment rate in the South of Italy may drive a different response of the layoff rate to UB eligibility. Furthermore, different social norms (Banfield, 1958, Bigoni, Bortolotti, Casari, Gambetta, 2018, Bigoni, Bortolotti, Casari, Gambetta, Pancotto, 2016, Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2004) may induce employees and employers to react in a different way to the same type of moral hazard.====Our results confirm the existence of moral hazard. According to our preferred specification, we find that immediately after reaching UI eligibility, the probability of layoff increases by 12% for at least 16 weeks. The impact is significantly larger after the Great Recession, when the instantaneous increase is of 21%, while no effect is found before 2008. In the South, the effect peaks at 24%, whereas in the rest of Italy, the overall effect is not significantly different from zero. The layoff rates in smaller firms also show a more pronounced reaction. We find no evidence of a substitution between quits and layoffs. Similar conclusions are reached if we rely on a regression discontinuity design (RDD) estimator identifying the effect around the 52 weeks eligibility threshold.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the theoretical setting and review the existing empirical literature. Section 3 presents the Italian institutional framework for the period under analysis.

How cognitive abilities affect schooling may have important policy implications, especially in developing countries during periods of increasing educational attainment. Using two longitudinal labor surveys that collect direct proxy measures of cognitive skills, we study the importance of specific cognitive domains for the returns to schooling in two samples. We instrument for schooling levels and we find that each additional year of schooling leads to an increase in earnings by approximately 18-20 percent. The estimated effect sizes—based on the two-stage least squares estimates—are above the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. Furthermore, we estimate and demonstrate the importance of specific cognitive domains in the classical Mincer equation. We find that executive functioning skills (i.e., memory and orientation) are important drivers of earnings in the rural sample, whereas higher-order cognitive skills (i.e., numeracy) are more important for determining earnings in the urban sample. Although numeracy is tested in both samples, it is only a statistically significant predictor of earnings in the urban sample. (JEL I21, F63, F66, N37)","Education is widely accepted as a leading instrument for promoting better economic outcomes at an individual level (UNESCO, 2005). Following the innovative analyses by Mincer (1958, 1974), the literature examines the economic returns to differing levels of schooling at an individual level.==== Education can positively influence non-monetary outcomes, as it can reduce crime (Lochner and Moretti, 2004), improve health (Currie and Moretti, 2003), and improve civic engagement (Milligan et al., 2004). A large body of empirical literature investigates the monetary returns to education in developed and developing countries.==== In general, estimated returns to education are larger in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Previous studies that examine the returns to education in developing countries rely on observational study designs. For sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of poverty are among the highest in the world (World Bank, 2016), education is particularly important. The issue of causal estimation of the returns to schooling is central for careful policy targeting. However, previous empirical estimates that used data from sub-Saharan Africa rely on observational study designs, which are ill-equipped to detect true causal effects. Precisely measuring the returns to schooling in the context of sub-Saharan countries is a challenge plagued by econometric issues, data availability constraints (Card, 1999, 2001), and survey design issues (Serneels et al., 2017).==== For example, the socioeconomic characteristics of households and communities are important determinants of both schooling and labor market outcomes in developing countries. The omission of individual ability measures in empirical estimations can lead to large upward bias (ability bias) of observational study estimates (Lang, 1993). In practice, the bias present in estimates based on observational study designs could be quite large.====In this paper, we examine the returns to cognitive skills and the returns to schooling using data from South Africa.==== We use two surveys which collected extensive household information, including various dimensions of cognition. The surveys were conducted between 2002 and 2014 in two distinct regions of South Africa: urban and rural. They provide data on how various dimensions of cognition influence schooling and labor market outcomes in rural and urban settings. In particular, the use of two distinct surveys from two contrasting areas of South Africa enables an examination of the implications of heterogeneous local labor markets on the importance of specific cognitive domains. The first survey that we use is Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Survey of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI). HAALSI examines a rural population aged 40 and older. The second survey, the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), follows a metropolitan area population aged between 14 and 22. Both surveys collect cognitive evaluations via direct measurements of specific cognitive domains. In HAALSI (2014), four cognitive domains were tested: memory, numeracy, orientation, and attention. In CAPS (2002–2009), a cognitive evaluation was administered in Wave 1 (2002) and evaluated the domains of literacy and numeracy. Using data from the five waves of the CAPS panel data and the baseline wave of the 2014 HAALSI, we examine the influence of each cognitive domain on reported earnings. Furthermore, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to compile information from specific cognitive domains into an aggregate index and examine the impact of both specific cognitive measures and the aggregate cognitive index on the estimated returns to schooling.====Theoretical research by Ben-Porath (1967) and Becker (1975, 101, n. 89), and empirical studies in sub-Saharan countries (Boissiere et al., 1985; Field et al., 2009), indicate that cognitive skills influence schooling attainment. The failure to account for measures of cognitive ability in observational study designs that estimate the Mincer equation tends to bias the return to schooling estimates. Recent empirical comparisons have shown a gap between ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variables (IV) estimations of the returns to schooling (Card, 2001; Trostel et al., 2002). The magnitude of ability bias in the returns to schooling can be an important factor that contributes to this discrepancy. Without causal estimates of the returns to schooling, gauging the ability bias in observational study designs can shed some light on the true lack of accuracy of observational study estimates on the returns to schooling in low-income countries.====We report three major findings. First, we find that the OLS estimate for the return to each additional year of schooling acquired is 14 percent (based on Wave 5 of the CAPS). Based on HAALSI, the OLS estimate for each additional year of schooling acquired is approximately 10 percent. These estimates are similar to estimates based on survey data from sub-Saharan Africa from Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004). Second, when we instrument for individual schooling levels using schooling fees, we find evidence consistent across all two-stage least squares (2SLS) specifications of higher effect size. Using the schooling fees as an instrument, we find that each additional year of schooling leads to an increase in earnings by approximately 18-20 percent (significant at the 5-percent level). When we use the quarter of birth as an instrument, the estimated return to each additional year of schooling increases up to 28 percent, but these estimates are imprecisely estimated.==== Our IV estimates are generally higher than the OLS estimates, a difference likely due to the 2SLS estimation being based on individuals with high marginal returns to schooling. In the third estimation, we detect evidence that suggests that specific cognitive domains play a far more important role in determining a person's earnings than general cognitive skills.==== Virtually no prior research examines the importance of cognitive skills for earnings in sub-Saharan countries. This is largely due to a lack of longitudinal data on specific cognitive skills and earnings. Based on the two samples, the overarching pattern that we observe is that, in the rural sample, executive functions (e.g., memory or orientation skills) are more important for earnings. Conversely, in the urban sample, higher-order cognitive skills are more important. Although numeracy skills are evaluated in both samples, it is a statistically significant predictor of earnings only in the urban CAPS sample.====This paper makes four important contributions to the labor economics literature on the returns to schooling in developing countries. First, we contribute to understanding the effects of cognitive skills on the returns to education==== We estimate and demonstrate the importance of specific cognitive domain proxies in the classical Mincer equation. Our results suggest that cognitive ability scores explain a sizable, positive effect on earnings and slightly diminish the effect of schooling on earnings. Related to this issue, we show that the earnings gap between blacks/coloured and whites in South Africa is considerably reduced when we account for the ability measures. Neal and Johnson (1996) find a similar result in the context of the U.S. racial wage gap. In contrast, cognition measures do not influence the gender earnings gap. These findings imply that differences in premarket skills do account for a significant portion of the earnings gap across population groups, but do not seem to play a large role in the gender earnings gap in South Africa. Second, we contribute to the existing empirical literature by estimating the returns to certain dimensions of cognition that proxy for innate ability. Furthermore, cognitive skills measures implicitly provide information about the fundamental role of schooling quality and non-school factors in the production of human capital, which have been overlooked in the previous standard estimations of returns to schooling (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008). Our results suggest that certain domains of cognition may be more important for earnings than other domains are. When we split the ability proxy into specific cognitive domain components, we find that only the numeracy domain in the CAPS sample and the memory and orientation domains in the HAALSI sample are statistically significant determinants of earnings. Third, although we rely on a limited sample size and an arguably imperfect instrument, we provide suggestive evidence of the causal estimates of the returns to schooling in South Africa by exploiting an IV estimation approach. We also provide suggestive evidence on the magnitude of the ability bias in the context of a developing country. Although much has been written about ability bias (Lang, 1993), and numerous empirical papers have estimated arguably causal returns to schooling in high-income countries (Card, 2001), little is known about the true casual returns in the context of low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the measures of cognitive skills that we use are an important proxy for ability, they are not a direct measure of ability. Nevertheless, we examine how the inclusion of proxies for ability enhances understanding of the effects of cognitive skills on the returns to education. Finally, we provide additional evidence on the returns to schooling based on two survey sources drawn from two distinct demographic groups. HAALSI (conducted in 2014) surveyed an aging generation of rural South Africans, aged 40 and older. In contrast, the CAPS, collected between 2002 and 2009 in a metropolitan area, gathered information on young adults, aged between 14 and 22. By using two distinct samples—one based in an urban setting and another based in a rural setting—with rich data on various cognitive domains, we gain a better understanding of the relationship between the returns to schooling and specific cognitive domains in two distinct settings in the context of a developing country.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section II provides background information about South Africa's education system, major cognitive domains, and previous research about the role that cognitive domains play in determining a person's earnings. Section III describes the survey data, sampling strategies, and overall sample characteristics. Section IV presents the empirical strategy. Section V reports the results.

A summary includes, but is not limited to, the colonization, annexation, and military occupation of Hawaii (Sai, 2008; Silva, 2004), genocide (Thornton, 1987), massacres (e.g., Wounded Knee, Brown 2007), forced relocation (e.g., the “Trail of Tears”) and isolation in Indian reservations (Foreman, 1972), disenfranchisement (Wolfley, 1991), the slaughter of the bison (Feir et al., 2019), and the forcible assimilation of Indigenous children through Indian boarding schools (Adams, 1995; Feir, 2016, Feir, 2016). See Nabokov (1999) for a historical summary.====These injustices extend to contemporary racial disparities, which are some of the largest. Among racial and ethnic minorities, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) have the lowest employment-to-population ratio (54.6%, with 59.9% for whites), the highest unemployment rate (9.9%, with 4.6% for whites) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016), and they earn significantly less income (median income of $35,060 in 2010, compared to $50,046 for the nation as a whole) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). These disparities are less stark for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) as they have the highest employment-to-population ratio (62.8%); though, this reflects a stronger economy in Hawaii. Even absent this, unemployment rates are still higher for NHPIs relative to whites (5.7%, versus 4.6%) (U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics 2016). Poverty rates among those who identify as AIAN alone (NHPI) are nearly double (1.5 times) the rates of those in the general population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015; WHIAAPI, 2010). For NHPIs, these disparities are even more substantial for the 22% of AIANs who reside or used to reside on one of the 326 federal or state Indian reservations (Gitter and Reagan, 2002; Taylor and Kalt, 2005; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) or in Alaska Native Statistical Areas (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).==== These disparities are only becoming more relevant as Indigenous populations grow.====Several factors could contribute to these disparities, such as differences in education, geography (especially in or near Indian reservations), and the intergenerational legacy of colonialism, such as the harmful effects of Indian Residential schools (Adams, 1995; Feir, 2016, Feir, 2016) and the slaughter of the bison by colonial settlers (Feir et al., 2019).====Another possible explanation is employment discrimination which anecdotal and survey evidence==== suggest may be occurring, Indigenous Peoples also face negative stereotypes, some of which could contribute to discrimination.==== Economists typically distinguish between three sources of employment discrimination: taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957),==== levels-based statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973; Phelps, 1972),==== and variance-based statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain, 1977)==== (see Lahey and Oxley (2018) for an excellent discussion). Psychology adds the concept of implicit bias, where discrimination occurs due to unconscious bias (Greenwald and Mahzarin, 1995).==== Sociologists conceptualize discrimination as being caused by numerous factors that are intrapsychic, organizational, or structural (Pager and Shepherd, 2008; Small and Pager, 2020). Employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples could occur from any of these sources.====We are only aware of one peer-reviewed quantitative study that studied employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples in the United States.==== Hurst (1997) decomposed the AIAN-white earnings gap using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method. Hurst (1997) found that, while observable factors such as education and geography explain a large part (87%) of the gap, there is “still a substantial unexplained differential in earnings between the various categories of Indians and non-Indians.” (p. 805).====Quantifying employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples is essential to inform policies to reduce these significant economic disparities. If there is little discrimination, then disparities are primarily caused by factors other than employment discrimination like differences in education, which policymakers may be able to target directly. However, if there is significant discrimination, then this may suggest that supply-side policy measures like education or skills training==== may be less effective at closing this gap. In this case, stronger discrimination laws, or stronger enforcement of them, could be more helpful, as could efforts that seek to reduce discriminatory attitudes or behaviours or our abilities to act upon them.====To quantify discrimination, we conducted a field experiment of hiring discrimination—a resume correspondence study—sending applications to job openings. Resume correspondence studies are the preferred method of estimating employment discrimination because they can hold all factors other than minority status constant (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017; Gaddis, 2018; Neumark, 2018) which is not the case for decomposition studies that use survey data (e.g., Hurst, 1997).====In our field experiment, job applications are identical on average but are either signalled to be white or Indigenous (Native American, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian). Our general approach follows previous studies of this nature (e.g., Baert et al., 2013; Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Carlsson and Rooth, 2007; Neumark et al., 2019a; Pager, 2003) by estimating hiring discrimination by comparing interview offer rates (“callbacks”) by race.====Since signalling Indigenous status is not straightforward, we use four different methods. Our most common signal is volunteer experience, where we mention Indigenous status in the description of a volunteer experience, mirroring Tilcsik (2011), Ameri et al., 2019, and Namingit et al., 2017. Our second most common signal is language, through listing an Indigenous language along with English as mother tongues in a language section on the resume. We also occasionally signal Native Hawaiian status using Native Hawaiian first names or Native American status by using last names of Navajo ancestry.====We also quantify whether there is an additional bias against Native Americans from Indian reservations. Employers may have negative perceptions of these reservations, as poverty rates there are higher (Collett et al., 2016), incomes are lower (Akee and Taylor, 2014), economic conditions are worse (Akee and Taylor, 2014; Gitter and Reagan, 2002; Taylor and Kalt, 2005), and educational quality can be lower (DeVoe et al., 2008). If Native Americans from Indian reservations who move to urban centres experience discrimination because of their upbringing, then this makes it more difficult for them to move to these urban centres. Thus, migration is a less useful way for them to seek economic opportunities and possibly escape poverty. Estimating this potential bias against Native Americans who move from Indian reservations to urban centres is increasingly vital given increasing migration over time from Indian reservations to urban centres (e.g., Snipp, 1996; Pickering, 2000).====Our large-scale field experiment, based on 13,516 job applications in 11 cities and five occupations, shows no evidence of discrimination in callbacks against Indigenous Peoples in any of these cities and occupations. We similarly find no additional bias against Native Americans who lived on an Indian reservation. Our results do not vary by which combination of four signals for Indigenous status we use. Our results hold under a battery of robustness checks which include alternative functional forms and clustering, weighting, alternative callback measures, and correcting for the variance of unobservables (Neumark, 2012).====Our finding of no difference in callbacks is less common compared to the literature (Baert, 2018; Neumark, 2018). Of all resume correspondence studies from 2005 to 2018, 80 (78.4%) show significantly negative discrimination, 17 (16.7%) show no statistical evidence of discrimination, and five (4.6%) show significant preference for the minority group (Baert, 2018). However, publication bias may be a problem, as discrimination experiments with null results are less likely to be published (Zigerell, 2018).====We also conduct a complementary Gelbach (2016) and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of disparities in wages, unemployment rates, unemployment durations, and employment durations. We decompose the extent to which differences in observable characteristics explain these economic disparities, and what portion of the disparities remains unexplained, which could suggest discrimination. This provides an alternative measure of discrimination that, while possibly biased, is broader than our experiment by, for example, covering more cities and occupations, and covering contexts outside of hiring discrimination.====In our preferred decomposition, we find that AIANs have a large, unexplained gap in unemployment rates of 4.3 percentage points and we also find weak evidence of slightly longer unemployment durations. We do not find unexplained gaps in wages, controlling for occupation, or in employment durations. For NHPIs, we find an unexplained gap of 4.1% lower wages, a 0.7 percentage point higher unemployment rate, and weak evidence of slightly ==== unemployment durations.====Despite not finding discrimination in callbacks against Indigenous Peoples in our audit field experiment, this does not imply that Indigenous Peoples in the United States do not face employment discrimination at all. We discuss how certain choices for our experiment could have affected our estimates, such as the saliency of our racial signals, our choice of cities and occupations, and the relatively higher labour market tightness during our study. Our decomposition of economic disparities, despite the problems with this approach, also suggests that there could be hiring discrimination outside the context of our audit study. This is evidenced by Indigenous Peoples facing higher unexplained unemployment rates and holding lower-wage occupations.====In addition to this study being the first audit study of discrimination against Indigenous Peoples in North America, our study also provides many methodological contributions to the audit studies literature more broadly. We conduct numerous robustness checks and discuss other considerations that are crucial to the interpretation of audit studies. These include, but are not limited to pre-registering our experiment, using more than one method of signalling minority status, testing how salient signals of minority status and other resume features are, controlling for the variance of unobservables (Neumark, 2012), using population and occupation weighting to generate study-population-representative results, testing and discussing how our results vary by occupation and city, and exploring how our results vary by labour market tightness and economic cycles.

The policy intention is studied by comparing private information to perfect information. Since the laws do not prevent voluntary revelation of salaries, a third treatment examines the impact of adding a truthful revelation choice by the informed party. I find that the signaling value of revelation decisions undermines the benefits of private information. A fourth treatment allows for outside options to be misrepresented. Overall, results suggest that these laws may not work as well as intended.","As part of the larger push for Equal Pay legislation in the United States, several states and municipalities have recently passed laws regarding revelation of salary histories. While the details of these laws differ across jurisdictions, they have several common features. These laws explicitly prohibit employers from seeking salary history information of potential employees during the hiring process.==== While some laws are silent on employees volunteering their salary history information, others have explicit clauses that allow for this possibility (California and Connecticut, for instance). In fact, the California law states “If an applicant voluntarily and without prompting discloses salary history information to a prospective employer, nothing in this section shall prohibit that employer from considering or relying on that voluntarily disclosed salary history information in determining the salary for that applicant”.==== Table 1 lists the municipalities and states that have passed these laws, with the date of enforcement and restrictions, if any.====The stated goal of these laws is to prevent the persistence of low salaries among groups that were underpaid due to discrimination to begin with, especially women. The aim is to ensure that low paying jobs held early in a woman’s career (or poorly negotiated ones) do not have an impact on future salaries. Supporters claim that the potential impact of this law will be to raise the relative wages of women compared to similarly qualified men. Opponents claim that it would complicate the hiring process and increase litigation risk. They believe that open discussion about salary history as well as future salary expectations actually benefit employees in making decisions about jobs. Since this is a contentious issue, the laws have faced backlash from some members of the business community. For instance, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit questioning the validity of the law and filed a motion for preliminary injunction. More importantly, two states (Michigan and Wisconsin) have passed laws that explicitly ban the passage of such laws by local governments within the state with the intention of protecting employers’ right to solicit salary information from prospective employees. Barring these two exceptions, the rapid expansion of these laws across various states suggests that several other states may follow suit, and a federal law may be in the cards as well. Thus far, 16 states and 10 cities have passed some form of ban on salary history inquiries.====Because the laws are recent, empirical evidence of the impact of these laws on salaries for new jobs is scant. Aside from issues of data and timing, identifying the causal impact of such a law using observational data may be challenging since the laws are sometimes announced months or years before being enforced, and even when enforced, employers are only liable for penalties at a much later date, giving employers several months to address salary disparities. In some cases, there are other contemporaneous policy changes which may have confounding effects making it harder to disentangle the impact of the law under scrutiny.==== Real world bargaining is complex and different features of these laws may have countervailing effects on wage outcomes. The main focus on this paper, therefore, is to examine the impact of certain aspects of such policies in a simple game-theoretic framework and to test those predictions in the lab. The controlled setting of the lab enables comparisons between treatment conditions which would not be possible with observational data. I examine the intended benefits of the policy by comparing the private information case with a perfect information benchmark. The efficacy of these laws may be affected by the fact that the laws either explicitly or implicitly allow prospective employees to voluntarily reveal their salary history to employers. Employers may treat non-revelation of salary history as a negative signal, since those with higher salaries would be much more likely to voluntarily disclose such information. To this end, I examine how the introduction of a voluntary information revelation choice can affect offers and final payoffs. Finally, I am also interested in understanding if individuals with an informational advantage behave strategically to misrepresent that information if they are free to do so, and how these results compare to other information regimes. Along with perfect information, this regime is also an important policy counterfactual to consider, since it is unclear whether real world salary revelations are necessarily truthful.====I conduct an ultimatum bargaining experiment with different information treatments regarding disagreement payoffs (the outside option). While the outside option of the proposer (====) is always fixed and known, the outside option of the responder (====) can be one of two types, low or high. In the perfect information treatment (====) ====’s outside option is known to ====. In the second treatment (====), it is privately known, while in the third I introduce a voluntary disclosure choice for ==== to truthfully reveal their outside option before the proposer makes an offer (====). In the final cheap-talk treatment, I allow ==== the choice to misrepresent their outside option (====). In a way, the third and the fourth treatment represent important modifications to the private information case that lie at two extremes; the former representing an environment where all revelations are truthful while the latter allows for deception that has no explicit punishment or cost. Using this framework, I answer the following questions: Under which conditions are offers observed by those with the low outside option higher under private information as compared to perfect information? If offers are indeed higher, does adding a truthful information revelation choice before the offer is made affect the benefit of private information because of inferences the uninformed party can make based on revelation behavior? Do informed agents strategically misrepresent their outside option for perceived benefits? What implications do theory and the experimental results have for salary history bans?====I find that introducing a truthful revelation choice for the informed party (====) undermines some of the benefits of private information, and outcomes come closer to the perfect information case. Based on the revelation choices of ====, therefore, ==== can make some inferences about their opponents outside option. Confirming theoretical predictions, cheap-talk outcomes resemble those under private information since revelation signals are uninformative. This is because the overwhelming majority of those with a low outside option either hide or misrepresent their outside option as high in the hope of eliciting higher offers. The superior outcomes for those with a low outside option under private information reflects the intended effect of a policy that gives an informational advantage to one party in bargaining. Inequality is lowest under private information and highest under perfect information. The experiment also demonstrates that the voluntary revelation feature of such policies may erode the informational advantage. Inequality is higher in this treatment as compared to the private information case. The similarity in results of the cheap-talk treatment and private information indicates that if we believe that potential employees can lie about their outside options and that employers know this, then their information is essentially private to begin with.====Admittedly, real world wage bargaining may be more complicated than the ultimatum bargaining framework chosen here. I consider only two outside options, whereas an employer may have a continuous probability distribution over a range of possible salaries in mind while negotiating with an employee. Salary histories may not be exactly known by employers (perfect information) and it isn’t realistic to expect a situation in which they are private and we can compel all employees from revealing them (private information). To motivate these modeling choices, note that in a representative sample survey of U.S workers, Hall and Krueger (2012) find that only one-third did not consider their offer to be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, which suggests that ultimatum bargaining may not be uncommon. Half the respondents also said that their employers had learned their pay in their earlier jobs before making the offer that led to the current job. The private information case in this paper is a benchmark that indicates the policy intention, and is useful to study as such to reveal the full benefits of private information. It may also not be common knowledge that everyone who chooses to reveal their prior salary does so truthfully (truthful revelation treatment) or one in which lying about your previous salary is as easy as the click of a button without any chance of being found out or any real consequence (cheap talk). There is some evidence, however, that misrepresenting current salaries is a very real phenomenon. For instance, a labor market study of 60,000 respondents across 28 countries in Europe conducted by an international data company, Intelligence Group,==== revealed that around 25% of Europeans lie about salaries during negotiations. This number is as high as 43% in countries like Germany and much lower in the United Kingdom and Greece. Given the sensitive nature of such a question, it is conceivable that these underestimate the actual degree of lying about previous salaries. A recent survey by Agan et al. (2020) also finds that only 5% of respondents believe with certainty that their current salary disclosures would be verified by potential employers. Thus, while understanding the limitations of modeling choices that yield clean and empirically testable predictions for this lab experiment is important when thinking about policy implications, there is evidence to suggest that even these simple cases may have wider implications for labor markets. A more general theoretical framework with less restrictive modeling choices which can also be adapted to study the salary history laws can be found in Cullen and Hurson (2019). My experiment tests the theoretical prediction on an extension of their model which also argues that these laws may be ineffective, for exactly the same reason as elaborated upon in this paper. This is discussed further in the next section.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses selected literature most closely related to my experimental design and the policy question. The theoretical framework and hypotheses are discussed in section 3.

We do so by using worker-level PIAAC data to account for task heterogeneity within occupations. Our contribution is threefold: First, we compute abstract, routine and manual task measures that are found to be well-validated visa-vis previous research. Second, we estimate task prices, and find that a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks is related to a 3.3-log-point wage premium, whereas there is a 2.6 to 2.9-log-point wage penalty for each ","Recent technological change has led to the automation of tasks that follow precise and well-understood procedures or routines. As workplace computerisation and robotisation have been replacing the humans who previously performed these routines, there has been a gradual change in the contents/tasks demanded in the workplace, especially in a range of low- and medium-skill occupations. The theoretical and empirical study of the reshaping of the structure of labour demand has been the focus of a growing body of literature pioneered by Autor, Levy and Murnane (ALM) (2003), and further developed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor and Handel (2013) (henceforth AH), Goos, Manning and Salomons (2014) and, more recently, by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a, 2018b). The new theoretical model used in these analyses is based on the task-based approach. Production requires the allocation of tasks to capital or labour, and new technologies require changes in the allocation of tasks to these factors of production. Tracking such changes in the task content of production has been found to be valuable for understanding how labour demand is changing as a result of automation. In particular, ALM (2003), Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor and Dorn (2013) and Goos et al. (2014) have found that computerisation is associated with an increase in non-routine cognitive tasks and a decrease in routine manual and routine cognitive tasks.====There are, however, significant challenges associated with using the task framework, with measurement undoubtedly being among them. To approximate job tasks, the first empirical studies drew upon a detailed occupation dataset, The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), or its successor, the Occupation Information Network (O*NET). However, Spitz-Oener (2006) using data for Germany, and more recently, AH for the US, documented substantial heterogeneity in job contents even within detailed occupations. These findings encourage the use of workplace-level data rather than occupational-based data to measure job contents/tasks, especially if the aim is to provide a precise estimation of task prices. In this paper, we account for this need, and use individual information on job tasks to explore, first, cross-country differences in task endowments for a harmonised sample of developed countries. A second and more important aim of our study is to explore the link between tasks and wages by estimating task prices in a cross-country setting in order to devise country differentials in task prices, and to examine their potential drivers. We do so by using data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), a survey that provides harmonised information across countries, and that contains very precise information on job contents at the worker level. Furthermore, the PIAAC survey data contain precise information on workers’ skills (based on the results of numeracy and literacy cognitive tests) that goes beyond the educational level attained. These data enable us to estimate the factors that underlie the intensity of task endowments, as well as their prices conditional on a more precise measure of workers’ skills. Moreover, these survey data provide excellent controls of individual skills that we can use in determining and interpreting task prices.====A cross-country analysis of these developments is needed because previous evidence has shown that the process of de-routinisation has not followed identical paths across countries. Hardy et al. (2018) documented an increase rather than a decrease in routine cognitive employment in the transition economies of Eastern and Central Europe. Gimpelson and Kapeliushnikov (2016) and Aedo et al. (2013) found similar results for Russia and Southern European countries, respectively. Hence, there is clear a need for an assessment of job tasks as well as task prices based on a comparable sample of developed countries at the worker level. Ours is not the first study to use the PIAAC dataset to explore task contents and their cross-country differences. Recent studies, such as Marcolin et al. (2018) and Lewandowski et al. (2019), have used PIAAC data to construct a routine job index and the cross-country differentials. However, our study is the first to explore the link between tasks and wages, particularly to estimate task prices and their differentials across countries.====Empirical evidence on task prices is scarce. In the US, AH found that a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks predicts a seven-log-point wage premium; a one-standard-deviation increase in manual tasks results in a wage penalty of 11 log points; while an increase in routine tasks is not related to any significant difference in wages====. Other studies that have explored the link between tasks and wages with individual-level data for the US are Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2013), and, more recently, Bohm (2020). Additionally, Spitz-Oener (2003) estimated task returns for Germany. This paper's main contributions are to extend the single-country analysis of task prices to a broad group of developed countries, to show their differences, and to try to envisage potential drivers. As our task measures closely resemble those of AH, our aims are to estimate prices for abstract, routine and manual tasks for 19 developed countries; to compare our results (for the US) with those found by AH; and to explore the cross-country differentials. Furthermore, the PIAAC survey data contain precise information on workers’ skills (based on the results of numeracy and literacy cognitive tests) that goes beyond the educational level attained. These data enable us to estimate task prices conditional on workers’ skills, and, hence, to obtain a measure of the market demand for each of the constructed tasks====.====Our findings represent a relevant contribution to the literature. First, our task measures, and the items these measures are based on, are well-validated vis-a-vis previous research using the PIAAC, as well as other worker-level studies, such as AH. Averaged at the occupational level, our task measures show very high correlations with respect to O*NET, specifically for abstract tasks. Based on these measures, we depict the differences in tasks across countries, provide suggestive evidence on the importance of the within-occupation variation in task measures across countries, and relate those task disparities across countries with variables that have been shown to reflect countries’ development levels (such as GDP per capita, ICT capital stock or numeracy skills). Second, we estimate wage returns to tasks (task prices), and find that within occupations, a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks is related to a 3.3-log-point wage premium. For routine (manual) tasks, we find that the individual returns within occupations are a 2.6- (2.9)-log-point wage decrease for each standard deviation of routine tasks. Finally, we address the differences in task prices across countries by computing the relationship between country level variables and task prices. We find suggestive evidence that supply-and-demand factors can help to explain task returns: i.e., the higher the task endowment in a country is, the more attenuated the positive or the negative deviation in the price of this specific task is. Development factors, as well as labour market institutions – particularly union coverage and the strictness of employment protection legislation – seem to play a role in the differences in all three task prices.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

We provide new insights that could help organise the future of work in a meaningful and dignifying way and propose concrete avenues for future research on meaningful work in economics.","The concept of meaningful work—activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile—has received relatively little attention in modern economics.==== While organisational psychologists have long examined the meaning people derive from their jobs (Rosso et al., 2010), modern economists typically conceive of work as a disutility, i.e. as an unpleasant activity that must be endured as a means to earn an income and finance consumption. Nevertheless, studies relying on self-reported and experimental data have challenged the assumption that only monetary motivations matter in the labour market (Binder, 2016, Bradler, Dur, Neckermann, Non, 2016, Hamermesh, 2018, Hamilton, 2000, Kosfeld, Neckermann, Yang, 2017, Preston, 1989, Stern, 2004). In fact, one convincing piece of evidence for the intrinsic value of work is the enormous psychological cost of becoming unemployed, which by far exceeds income losses (Clark, 2001, Kassenboehmer, Haisken-DeNew, 2009, Knabe and Rätzel, 2011, Knabe and Rätzel, 2011, Nikolova, Ayhan, 2019, Winkelmann, Winkelmann, 1998).====Nevertheless, despite the recent attention to non-monetary work-incentives (Lazear, 2018), only two economics papers have called for incorporating work meaningfulness in standard labour supply models (Cassar, Meier, 2018, Spencer, 2015). Meanwhile, the empirical research on meaningful work in organisational psychology has left several knowledge gaps (Lysova et al., 2019). While important, these studies rely on small non-representative samples, lack a unified definition of work meaningfulness, and use divergent measurement scales that often conflate meaningfulness with other constructs such as calling (Bailey, Lips-Wiersma, Madden, Yeoman, Thompson, Chalofsky, 2019, Bailey, Yeoman, Madden, Thompson, Kerridge, 2019). This is unfortunate because it limits our understanding of which factors contribute to work meaningfulness and whether it is conducive to behaviours such as increased effort and delayed retirement.====This paper closes these knowledge gaps by making a threefold contribution to the literature: first, we investigate the determinants and consequences of meaningful work using a cross-country nationally representative dataset of workers from 30 European countries in 2005, 2010, and 2015. Conceptually, we rely on self-determination theory (Deci, Ryan, 1985, Ryan, Deci, 2000), which outlines the conditions leading to motivation and work meaningfulness. Empirically, we construct an index of meaningful work based on survey statements about perceptions of doing useful work and having feelings of “a job well done” (fulfillment) (see Appendix Table A.2 and Fig. 1). As such, we are the first to quantify the relative importance of job characteristics that enhance or diminish work meaningfulness, which could help inform policies and interventions to promote it. We find that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are about 4.6 times more important for meaningfulness at work than compensation, benefits, career advancement, job insecurity, and working hours. Relatedness, which reflects supportive relationships with colleagues and superiors, emerges as the most important factor for work meaningfulness. These findings highlight the greater salience of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation for meaningfulness compared to objective working conditions and monetary rewards.====Second, we show that perceptions of meaningful work have implications for labour economics because they meaningfully predict retirement intentions, absenteeism, and skills training. For example, a ten-point increase in work meaningfulness reduces absenteeism by about one third of a working day per year and raises the intended retirement age by 2.5 years, on average. These findings not only validate the usefulness of work meaningfulness in economics but also have relevant implications for employers and policy-makers. Our third contribution is that we outline the conceptual and methodological steps for a future research agenda on meaningful work in economics.",What makes work meaningful and why economists should care about it,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300518,8 May 2020,2020,Research Article,291.0

Our empirical exercises illustrate the severity of the problem, as self-selection and intergenerational transmission of traits appear to bias estimates of the link between migrant behaviour and gendered language.","In the past decade, economists have begun to investigate the role of language in shaping economic behaviour (e.g., Caminal, Paolo, 2017, Olney, 2016; see Gazzola and Wickström, 2016, for an overview) and become particularly intrigued by the idea that language may have a causal influence on economic choices. For instance, in the most renowned paper, Chen (2013) shows that speakers of languages without strong grammatical distinction between present and future exhibit more future-oriented behaviours, perhaps because the future appears less distant in the daily routine of speaking. Another linguistic feature that has received much attention from economists is sex-based grammatical gender, which seems to link systematically to gender differences in economic outcomes. At the country level, several studies have documented a negative association between the dominant language’s gender marking and i) women’s participation in the labour market (Gay, Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, 2013, Jakiela, Ozier, 2018, Mavisakalyan, 2015); ii) pay equality (van der Velde et al., 2015); iii) women’s representation in politics as well as their access to credit and land (Gay, Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, 2013, Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, Gay, 2013); iv) female participation in corporate management and female managers’ propensity to lead large teams (Santacreu-Vasut et al., 2014); v) women’s entrepreneurial activity relative to men’s (Hechavarría et al., 2017).====Systematic differences in economic behaviour across speech communities might arise if speaking a language affects speakers’ cognition, by drawing her attention to, e.g., the distinction between present and future, or gender. While this effect of “thinking for speaking” (Slobin, 1996, Slobin, 2003) has been hypothesised by linguists at least since the 1950s, it is difficult to test empirically because linguistic features might coevolve with formal and informal institutions. To illustrate, consider a local community in which the mode of production, hundreds of years ago, relied on a highly gendered division of labour. Over time, the importance of this distinction of the male and female sphere may have shaped both the community’s language as well as formal and informal institutions. A growing body of empirical studies provides evidence that historical practices and modes of production in ancient societies—such as the use of plough cultivation (Alesina et al., 2013), the relative use of female labour in agriculture (Carranza, 2014), or the adoption of pastoralism as a form of subsistence (Becker, 2019)—predict contemporary gender differences among their descendants. Furthermore, these studies show that the adoption of certain production practices in ancient societies was determined by environmental conditions, which have also been found to be predictive of linguistic features of local languages, such as the presence of grammatical gender (Galor et al., 2018).==== Taken together, this evidence indicates that linguistic features do not evolve randomly, but rather in response to environmental features, possibly the same that also shape social practices, institutions and norms.====Previous research has addressed the coevolution of language and ==== institutions by exploiting within-country variation in linguistic structures (e.g., Jakiela, Ozier, 2018, Mavisakalyan, 2015).==== The goal of this paper is to shed light on the interrelatedness of language and ==== institutions, in particular social norms. As codes of conduct that prescribe how one “ought to behave”, social norms are more difficult to rule out as drivers of differences in behaviours across speech communities: Their members may, even within the same framework of formal rules, follow distinct informal rules.==== The contribution of our paper is, first, to develop a theoretical model that allows distinguishing more carefully the direct effect of language on behaviour from an indirect effect brought about by its coevolution with social norms. In that respect, it is closely related to a recent discussion of channels through which language could influence economic decision-making by Mavisakalyan and Weber (2018). Our model goes beyond their framework by integrating language into standard economic analyses, thereby providing a tool that can easily be adapted to study the effects of language in other contexts. Second, we present results from an empirical application that are consistent with the insights from the model, suggesting that the interrelatedness of language and social norms may render attempts of empirically measuring a direct effect of speaking a gendered language unsuccessful, as they are currently approached.====Our formal model of labour supply is based on an identity economics framework and allows individuals who care about matching the “ideal” level of participation for their gender, as given by a social norm, to distort their labour supply. In this set-up, language can affect the distortion in two ways. The direct effect of ==== a gendered language comes from drawing the speakers’ attention to a given norm: Frequent reference to gender makes speakers more perceptive of the norm, leading to stronger gender differences in labour supply among them relative to speakers of neutral languages. The ==== effect arises because the norm itself differs systematically across speaking communities, prescribing larger differences in the “ideal” behaviour for men and women in those speaking a gendered language.==== As a result, this second effect presents a challenge for researchers aiming at isolating the effect of ==== a gendered language.====Next, we extend the model to assess a strategy that some researchers (e.g., Santacreu-Vasut et al., 2013) have suggested to overcome this challenge: the so-called “epidemiological approach”. The method involves comparing migrants descending from different countries within the same country of residence and is widely used to study the effect of country-of-origin social norms on behaviour while ruling out institutional constraints (e.g., the education system or availability of childcare) and the overall economic environment as drivers (Fernández, 2011). We explore the merit of this strategy for isolating the causal effect of ==== a language in our theoretical model and show that it might not succeed. The intuition behind this result is that women who emigrate from countries with high language gender marking are more likely than women from other countries to be positively selected in terms of their labour market orientation, and thus to reject the social norms toward female labour force participation in their country of ancestry. Empirically, the selection effect may mask any potential cognitive effects of language.====Using the European Social Survey (ESS) and a linguistic dataset that is more comprehensive than the ones used in previous studies, we demonstrate these identification challenges empirically in an analysis of immigrants’ labour market behaviour in Europe. Conclusions regarding the extent to which language plays a role in shaping behaviour vary, depending on the linguistic indicator, sample composition (first- vs. second-generation immigrants), and language assignment (most commonly spoken at home vs. dominant language in country of origin). Generally, our results do not confirm the leading hypothesis in the literature that behaviour is more strongly in line with traditional gender norms for speakers of a gendered language. Instead, our results suggest at most a weak ==== correlation between gender-stereotypical behaviour and speaking a gendered language for some definitions of gender marking, and for women only. For men, we find a negligible effect regardless of the specification used. These results, however tentative, are consistent with the notion that language reflects social norms in a speaking community, and that those who select into migration (first generation) are more likely to reject these norms in their country of origin, and may transmit their traits to their children (second generation).====We believe that isolating the direct effect of speaking a gendered language is nevertheless an important goal given recent political debates about the role of language for gender equality and efforts to change language in pursuit of this goal. Examples include the official introduction of the Swedish gender neutral pronoun “hen” in 2012 (Sendén et al., 2015) and the increasingly common practice of substituting the gender neutral plural “they” for singular third person pronouns (he, she) in the English language (Baranowski, 2002, Pauwels, 2003). According to the channel proposed by linguists that we explore in this paper, genderless and natural gender languages should call less attention to gender and sex, which could have positive effects on equality. To the contrary, feminist language critique frequently calls for ==== gender-differentiation in language, e.g. in job titles, to improve equality by raising women’s visibility. From a policy perspective, the question of what works better (or what is more feasible)—making language more gender neutral or more gender symmetrical—is ultimately an empirical one.==== With the present paper, we hope to contribute to this worthwhile endeavour by focussing the discussion on the obstacles to measuring the cognition effects, which we show require more attention in order to move this research agenda forward.====The paper is organized as follows: We present our formal model of the effect of language on labour supply in Section 2, combining insights from linguistics and psycho-linguistics with identity economics.

Applicants to a training program were randomly assigned to one of three modalities: a full treatment consisting of vocational and soft skills training plus an internship, a partial treatment consisting of soft skills training plus an internship, or a control group with no training or internship. We find strong and lasting effects of the program on personal skills acquisition and expectations, but results are markedly different for men and women. Shortly after completing the program, all participants reported increased expectations for improved employment and livelihoods. This result is reversed for male participants after three and a half years, potentially explained by the program's negative short-run labor market effects for that group. On the other hand, female participants experience improved labor market outcomes in the short run and exhibit substantially higher levels of personal skills after three and a half years; the women in the study became more optimistic and reported higher self-esteem. Men experienced no such benefits. Our results suggest that job-training programs of this type can be transformative – for women, life skills mattered and made a difference. But they can also have a downside if, as was the case for men in this study, training creates expectations that are not met. Although, overall, impacts are similar for the full treatment and the partial treatment, the positive impacts on soft skills for women, and the adverse impacts on labor outcomes and expectations for men are stronger for the full treatment.","Vocational education programs have long been one of the mainstays of active labor market policies. The basic premise of these programs is that by providing skills rewarded in the labor market, the unemployed will find better paying jobs faster. In a simple labor supply model, the new skills raise the wage offers for program participants, generating job prospects above their reservation wages. The evidence on the effectiveness of these programs, however, is decidedly mixed (Blattman and Ralston, 2015; Brown and Koettl, 2015, McKenzie, 2017).====Among the possible hypothesized reasons for these programs’ mixed results is that the labor market may not value the specific skills the participants acquired. In particular, the curricula may lack important “soft” personal and social (“non-cognitive”) skills training (Heckman et al. 2006; Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014). Another concern with these programs is that they might generate expectations for better wages and employment conditions that do not materialize. Increased expectations might raise the reservation wage, but if training does not transfer skills that are sufficiently well-rewarded in the labor market, resulting wage offers may not match participants’ enhanced expectations. In this case, the worker would not be able to find a job that matched her expectations and could become discouraged.====In this paper we use an at-scale randomized field experiment to examine the differential impact of vocational and soft skills job training for youth in the Dominican Republic. The program, “Programa Juventud y Empleo” (PJyE), was designed to improve the employment opportunities of at-risk youth,==== given the relatively high level of unemployment among youth, especially young women. In 2009, the unemployment rate of youth ages 15 to 24 with secondary education or less was 16.6% overall and 28.1% for women. This was relatively high, compared to 5.9% for adults 25-40 (8.8 for women), and 3.8% for adults 41-64 (4.4% for women) (ENFT====). PJyE's main objective was to improve the employment opportunities of at-risk youth by building their vocational and soft skills. The program provided in-classroom training and an internship in a private business, and participants had to complete both to graduate from the program. The program also financed participants’ transportation, medical and accident insurance, and provided them with a small stipend. Between 2002 and 2013, the program conducted 3627 courses training over 72,500 youth, of which 57% were women.====We consider two interventions randomly assigned to program applicants: (1) vocational education combined with soft skills training and an internship and (2) soft skills-only training with an internship. We study both the short (one year) and medium run (three and a half year) effects, testing the effectiveness of the two alternative curricula. Consistent with the program's objectives, we examine effects on skill development, future expectations, labor market outcomes, and well-being. For women, we find that both curricula have strong positive effects on soft skills and on expectations of future labor market and life success. For men, however, neither curriculum had an effect on skills, although the curriculum with vocational education resulted in a positive effect on expectations. Hence, for men, the program illustrates conditions where expectations may exceed the returns to acquired skills, leading to discouragement.====In fact, we found striking gender differences in the effects on short-run labor market outcomes. For women, both curricula were associated with higher employment rates in higher paying jobs with higher job satisfaction twelve months after program completion. Remarkably, there were no differences in effects between the vocational and the soft skills-only curricula, suggesting limited marginal value of the vocational education on top of soft-skills training, plus internship. However, while men who received only soft-skills curriculum saw no labor market effects, those who received the vocational curricula did see a negative effect on short-run employment and were more likely to reject higher wage offers. This latter effect is consistent with the program having had no effect on skills but creating expectations of higher wage offers that did not materialize, which may have led to higher unemployment.====Three-and-a-half years after program completion (medium-run), neither curricula had an impact on employment or wages of either men or women. However, the interpretation of these results differs by gender. The training gave women skills that allowed them to find higher paying jobs faster than those in the control group. Over time, the women in the control group were able to catch up to those who benefitted from the program. On the other hand, men in the vocational education treatment group were more likely to turn down jobs, despite higher wage offers.====The different labor market experiences of men and women led to different effects on medium-run welfare. After three-and-a-half years, women in the treatment group still had significantly higher positive expectations about their future life success and prospects in the labor market than did the control group. They also reported higher job satisfaction, self-esteem, and that they now needed higher salaries to meet their basic needs. On the other hand, men in the treatment group reported higher rates of active job search (even if employed), an increased likelihood of turning down higher paying jobs, lower self-esteem, and reported needing lower salaries to meet their basic needs. In other words, while the program positively improved women's lives, men ultimately experienced deterioration in the quality of their lives.====This paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, to our knowledge, this is the first study to shed light on why vocational education programs may have limited or negative impacts on labor market outcomes by focusing on how programs affect both expectations and skills.====Second, it helps to disentangle the marginal impact of the vocational component from the soft-skills component and the internship. Despite the popularity of training programs that combine different types of skill trainings (usually vocational, soft-skills, and apprenticeships), the evidence on the effectiveness of each of the components is very scarce. There are several experimental evaluations of training programs in low- and middle-income countries with a combination of different skills tracks and apprenticeships.==== However, few of these studies separate out the marginal effects of the different components. An exception is Groh et al. (2016), which shows that a soft-skills training for women in Jordan increased the optimism and the expectations of the women about the future; however, the authors found no impact on labor outcomes. In a related study, Adhvaryu et al. (2018) study the effect of on-the-job soft skills training on a series of labor market outcomes for women garment workers in India. They also find increased extraversion and communication, and skill upgrading and higher productivity among beneficiaries, although they do not find evidence of increases in wages. To date, this is the first study that identifies the marginal impact of the vocational component. Since vocational training generally accounts for the bulk of the resources of these programs, this has practical implications in term of cost-effectiveness. We provide a simple cost-benefit analysis in the discussion section.====Third, our paper provides medium-term experimental evidence of the impact of training programs in developing countries. While the short-term effects of training programs have been studied extensively in developed countries,==== longer run experimental evidence for developing countries is still scarce and mixed. Ibarrarán et al. (2019) followed a different cohort of the PJyE for six years and found sustained effects on formality for men but no effects on employment. Other longer-run studies include Attanasio et. al (2015), who use experimental data from a training program in 2005 in Colombia and find that even up to ten years later, the program had a positive and significant effect on the probability of working in the formal sector, and earnings were 11.8% higher. Hirshleifer et al. (2014) used administrative data to study the impacts of vocational education training in Turkey three years after the intervention finding that impacts in the short term dissipated with time; and Alzua et al. (2016) studied the effects of the program Entra 21 in Argentina four years after the completion of the project, finding similar results.====Finally, gender differences are widely studied in the literature,==== but results remain inconclusive.==== Our results on gender differences are consistent with findings described by Attanasio et al. (2011), who evaluated Colombia's ==== program, which has a similar curriculum as PJyE. Conducted 20 months after the beginning of the intervention, the authors found positive labor market effects for women but not for men.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the interventions considered in this study. Section 3 describes the experimental evaluation design including random assignment, data collection, descriptive statistics, and estimation strategy.

The decline in employment in these occupations can be primarily accounted for by changes in transition rates from non-participation and unemployment to routine employment. We study how these transition rates have changed since the mid-1970s, and find that changes are primarily due to the propensity of individuals to make such transitions, whereas relatively little is due to ==== changes. We also find that changes in the propensity to transition into routine occupations account for a substantial proportion of the rise in non-participation observed in the U.S. in recent decades.","In recent decades, labor markets in the United States and other developed countries have become increasingly polarized: The share of employment in middle-wage occupations has declined, while employment in both high- and low-wage jobs has increased. This “hollowing out” of the middle of the wage distribution has been linked to the declining share of employment in occupations with a high content of ==== – those activities that can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures (see, for instance, Autor et al. (2006), Goos and Manning (2007), Goos et al., 2009 and Acemoglu and Autor (2011)). The declining employment in routine-intensive occupations has in turn been attributed to the fact that new technologies are particularly effective at performing these types of tasks (Autor et al., 2003).====In spite of the growing literature on polarization, relatively little is known about the individual-level patterns underlying the decline of routine employment. We use matched data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) to analyze transitions into and out of employment in routine occupations. Our view is that characterizing the process by which routine employment is disappearing serves as an important guide in formalizing and evaluating theories of job polarization. It is equally important to the understanding of the changing labor market opportunities faced by different demographic groups, which is crucial in assessing policy implications; for example, the appropriate policy response would differ if the decline is accounted for by changes in the occupational choices of new labor market entrants than if it is due to increasing exit rates out of the labor force of prime-aged workers from routine employment.====Thus, our goal is to compare the quantitative importance of transition rates into routine occupations (====) relative to transitions rates out of routine occupations (====) in the observed decline in routine employment.==== The set of inflow rates that we consider include transitions from labor force non-participation and unemployment to routine employment. The set of outflow rates that we consider are the reverse transitions, i.e. flows from routine employment to labor force non-participation and unemployment.====We begin the analysis in Section 2 by describing how we use data from matched CPS files to construct nationally representative labor market flows at a monthly frequency from 1976 to 2018. We classify individuals in each month according to their labor market status (employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force) and their current or most recent occupational group (non-routine cognitive, routine cognitive, routine manual or non-routine manual, detailed below), and track their transitions over time.====In order to determine which changes in transition rates are key in accounting for the decline of routine employment, we perform a series of counterfactual exercises in Section 3. In these counterfactuals we replace different transition rates (for example, the entry rate from out of the labor force into routine manual employment), with their values observed prior to the onset of polarization. Applying a law-of-motion equation and using these counterfactual transition rates, we obtain counterfactual values of routine employment which inform us about how routine employment would have evolved had a specific transition rate not changed. By comparing these counterfactual values to those observed in the data, we can determine how much of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented if particular entry or exit rates had remained at their pre-polarization levels.====Before commenting on our results, it is useful to relate our counterfactual approach to other methods in the literature. First, we note that our approach is similar in spirit to the literature analyzing the role of job finding rates and job separation rates in accounting for the dynamics of unemployment over the business cycle (e.g. Darby, Haltiwanger, Plant, 1985, Elsby, Michaels, Solon, 2009, Hall, 2006, Shimer, 2012). The key difference is that we analyze the secular decline in routine employment rather than the cyclical fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Our approach is also related to decomposition methods in economics (see e.g. Fortin et al., 2011), where the contribution of different channels to the observed change in an outcome variable of interest are quantified by counterfactually holding certain factors constant. Since in our particular setting counterfactuals need not add up to the total change (as is the case in decomposition approaches), we opt to use the term counterfactuals when referring to the experiments that we carry out, and use the term decomposition whenever we use more “common” decomposition methods in economics.====Turning to results, our key finding is that inflow rates are much more important than outflow rates in accounting for the decline of routine employment. Specifically, had the inflow rates remained at their pre-polarization levels, at least 40% of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented. In contrast, had the outflow rates not changed, less than 5% of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented.====These results are performed using aggregate transition rates. However, changes in aggregate transition rates can be the result of both changes in the demographic composition of the economy (given that different demographic groups have different transition rates), and changes in transition rates for given demographic groups. As such, when we perform counterfactuals that hold aggregate transition rates constant, we effectively also remove the changes that are driven solely by demographic change. To address this shortcoming, we distinguish between the role of demographic change and changes in transition propensities within demographic groups in Section 4.====We begin with a series of Oaxaca–Blinder decompositions (Blinder, 1973, Oaxaca, 1973), and show that the vast majority of the decline in the aggregate inflow rates to routine occupations are driven by propensity changes conditional on demographic characteristics. Next, we re-visit our counterfactual exercises in greater detail, allowing for transition rates to evolve heterogeneously across demographic groups, and taking into account the changing relative importance of different demographic groups in the U.S. economy.====Our first exercise gauges how much of the change in routine employment is due to changes in the demographic structure of the economy. To do so we allow each demographic group’s transition rates across the different labor market statuses to evolve as they did in the data. However, we hold the size of each demographic group constant at its 1976 level. This experiment results in a counterfactual series of aggregate labor market status that differs from the empirically observed one due solely to the lack of demographic change. By comparing the resulting counterfactual and observed routine employment changes, we can attribute a fraction of the decline to demographic change. In this experiment, we find that demographic change alone can account for less than a quarter of the total long-run decline in routine manual employment, and essentially none of the decline in routine cognitive occupations.====In our second set of counterfactuals, we allow for demographic change to occur as it did in the data, but we hold group-specific inflow and outflow rates constant at their pre-polarization era levels. Once again, we find that inflow rates are quantitatively much more important than outflow rates. Moreover, we show that changes in the inflow rates to routine employment not only account for a substantial fraction of the decline in these occupations, but they also account for nearly three quarters of the rise in non-participation observed over the last two decades. This indicates that these falling inflow rates to routine employment have ==== been matched with increasing inflow rates to ==== occupations; rather, they have resulted in increased propensities to remain out of employment.====We conclude our analysis by investigating which demographic groups are key in driving the changes that we have documented. Our quantitative finding is that three groups are salient in terms of their importance in driving the long-run dynamics of aggregate routine employment: males, the young, and those with intermediate levels of education.====As discussed above, relatively little attention has been paid to the labor market dynamics underlying the phenomenon of job polarization.==== Two recent papers are related to our analysis. Foote and Ryan (2014) analyze worker flows in the context of polarization, distinguishing between routine workers employed in different industries. Their paper differs from ours in that their primary goal is to study the cyclical properties of these flows, rather than their relationship with the long-term decline in routine employment. Smith (2013) describes the evolution of a number of flows into and out of routine employment and performs steady-state counterfactuals to analyze the importance of different transition rates in the decline of routine employment. As such, our papers share a number of findings, including the importance of job finding rate changes. At the same time, our analysis differs in a number of ways. First, our analysis allows us to determine not only the extent of transition rate change over time, but also how this is decomposed into composition and propensity change. Our detailed counterfactuals allow us to disentangle the role of demographic change and propensity change in accounting for the decline of routine employment. Second, while Smith (2013) focuses primarily on transitions between unemployment and employment, we analyze transitions into and out of the labor force, which we find to be key in accounting for routine employment dynamics. Finally, by using data from the 1970s, we are able to analyze how transition rates have changed relative to their levels prior to the onset of job polarization.",The dynamics of disappearing routine jobs: A flows approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300270,28 April 2020,2020,Research Article,294.0
"Jahn Elke,Neugart Michael","Institute for Employment Research and Bayreuth University, Regensburger Str. 104, Nuremberg 90478, Germany,Technische Universität Darmstadt, Department of Law and Economics, Hochschulstraße 1, Darmstadt 64289, Germany","Received 25 November 2018, Revised 18 March 2020, Accepted 20 March 2020, Available online 25 April 2020, Version of Record 11 May 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2020.101825,Cited by (8),"This paper investigates whether the employment status of neighbors influences the employment probability of workers who lost their job due to a plant closure, and the channels through which this occurs. Combining rich spatial information with administrative records, we find that a 10 percentage points higher neighborhood employment rate increases the probability of finding a job by 1.9%. Displaced workers not only benefit from neighborhood networks in terms of higher earnings and longer job stability but they are also more likely to find a job at the plant of a neighbor. These results indicate that neighbors refer workers to employers and that social norms are less likely to play a role.","The important role of social networks in people’s lives raises the question of how these networks influence individual labor market outcomes (see e.g., Ioannides, Loury, 2004, Jackson, 2010, Topa, Zenou, 2015). Finding a job after being laid off may not only be a function of individual characteristics and vacancies posted by firms. It may also be the result of social networks that influence job search behavior via social norms or give job seekers a competitive advantage by providing information on vacancies and referring them to firms.====In this paper, we draw on a novel geo-coded data set that comprises the universe of workers in 23 self-contained labor market regions in Germany. We draw workers who lost their jobs due to plant closures. Knowing where these workers live we then try to answer two questions: First, does the employment rate in the residential neighborhood of a job seeker affect her probability of finding a job? Second, can we ascribe the neighborhood effect on job-finding probabilities to social norms or information about vacancies and referrals? To answer the second question, we analyze the effect of the neighborhood employment rate on displaced workers’ match quality once they found a new job and investigate whether they find a job at the plant of a neighbor.====While, as most other studies, we do not directly observe the actual contacts an individual worker has in her social network, our approach enables us to address various other issues when it comes to identifying a social network effect. Focusing on workers who lost their job due to plant closures has several advantages: First, other types of job loss may be determined by unobserved individual characteristics, such as lack of human capital, low job performance or productivity that may affect labor market outcomes. In contrast, by focusing on separations due to plant closures, we identify workers who, for an exogenous reason from their perspective, become unemployed and start looking for a job (e.g., Glitz, 2017). Second, workers displaced due to plant closures have little chance of being recalled to jobs with their old employer and thus the job loss is permanent (e.g., Kletzer, 1998, for an early contribution). Third, as argued by Manski (1993), common factors affecting the employment status of an individual and her social network may flaw estimates of a social network effect. By focusing on workers who lost their jobs due to plant closures we can minimize the likelihood that the job loss was due to individual specific unobservables which are correlated with our network measure and may affect post-displacement labor market outcomes.====Identification for estimating a causal effect then rests on the assumption that a worker who lost her job due to a plant closure that was beyond her control is not systematically sorted into a neighborhood of one-square-kilometer size. Whether this is the case, hinges on workers not having chosen to live in a specific neighborhood before job loss. If they would self-select into a neighborhood for reasons we cannot observe, but that are related to employment-relevant characteristics of the neighborhood, estimates would be biased. We provide evidence based on the local nature of our data that sorting into neighborhoods is rather unlikely in our case. Thus, our study aims at exploiting variation that comes with displaced workers receiving “treatments” of varying degrees by living in neighborhoods with differing shares of employed workers.====We expect that higher neighborhood employment rates increase the probability of finding a job all else equal. The literature suggests three mechanisms that might improve the employment probability of a worker living in a neighborhood where a high share of residents is employed. First, the network may help potential employers overcome the problem of asymmetric information (Montgomery, 1991, Simon, Warner, 1992). As firms often have difficulties assessing the true productivity of job applicants, referrals from workers who live in the neighborhood may provide valuable information and make it more likely for firms to hire workers who already know someone working in the firm. Second, the neighborhood may provide information on job vacancies that workers without these contacts may not receive (Calvó-Armengol, Jackson, 2007, Topa, 2001). Third, one may observe faster transitions back into employment, not because the social network provides information but because of a social norm effect. In this case, workers living in neighborhoods with high employment rates may derive a negative utility from not being employed, as their status is different from the socially prevalent one. Thus, being employed is regarded as the social norm (see, among others, Agell, 1999, Akerlof, 1980, Besley, Coate, 1992, Lindbeck, Nyberg, Weibull, 1999), and not obeying the norm generates negative socio-psychological costs. Therefore, job search efforts of job seekers might be higher in neighborhoods with higher employment rates. Our empirical analysis tries to shed light on which of these mechanisms is more likely to explain an effect of the neighborhood employment rate on the job-finding probability of displaced workers.====In our preferred specification, we find that a 10 percentage points increase in the neighborhood employment rate increases the probability of being employed after six months by 1.9%. Furthermore, we provide evidence that employed neighbors who belong to similar socio-demographic groups make it easier to find new jobs. Regressions of daily earnings on neighborhood employment rates also reveal statistically significant positive effects. A 10 percentage points higher employment rate within a given neighborhood increases daily earnings for those who find a new job within six months by 4%. Moreover, jobs found after displacement last longer by almost two weeks and the probability to lose these jobs within the first 12 months falls by 2.8%. We argue that both, the higher earnings and the longer job stability, suggest that transmission of information or referrals rather than social norms are explaining higher job-finding rates. On top of that, we provide evidence that the probability to find a job at the plant of a neighbor increases with the neighborhood employment rate indicating that neighbors do refer job seekers to employers.====The literature defines social networks in various ways. Cappellari and Tatsiramos (2015) look into friendship ties, Kramarz and Nordström Skans (2014) study family ties as the relevant social network, and Dustmann et al. (2016) delineate networks in terms of ethnicity. Social networks, defined as a set of former coworkers, are the starting point for the studies by Cingano and Rosolia (2012), Glitz (2017), Saygin et al. (2019), or Hensvik and Nordström Skans (2016).====Our contribution relates to a literature that defines the relevant social network of a worker in terms of her residential neighborhood. The effect of neighborhood networks has been examined with respect to various outcome variables including the transition from welfare to work (Hoynes, 2000, Van der Klaauw, Van Ours, 2003), social insurance take-up (Markussen and Røed, 2015), the effect on children’s cognitive skills (Helmers and Patnam, 2014), technology adoption (Conley and Udry, 2010), or crime (Katz et al., 2001).====Our contribution is most closely related to the literature exploring the effects of neighborhood networks on employment, wages, and the quality of jobs. Datcher (1982), a very early contribution to the empirical literature on neighborhood effects, shows that a substantial fraction of the racial differences in education and earnings can be attributed to the poorer neighborhoods from which blacks come. More recent studies are Bayer et al. (2008), Hellerstein et al. (2011), and Hawranek and Schanne (2014) providing evidence that workers coming from the same residential neighborhood tend to cluster around specific work locations which is consistent with the idea of local referral networks. Burns et al., 2010 find that coming from a neighborhood with socio-economic characteristics that match the ones of the job seeker improves job-finding probabilities. Evidence that ethnic diversity has a negative effect on employment is provided by Hémet and Malgouyres (2018), and Dawkins et al. (2005) find that residential segregation affects racial differences in unemployment durations. Beaman (2012), Edin et al. (2003) and Damm (2009) document that the size and quality of the neighborhood affect employment and wages of refugees. That higher quality neighborhoods affect wages positively is also confirmed by Schmutte (2015).====The two contributions on neighborhood networks closest to our analysis are Hellerstein et al., 2019 and Bauer et al. (2011). Hellerstein et al., 2019 use mass layoffs to identify neighborhood network effects. In contrast to our analysis, they employ U.S. census tract data and rely on two measures of labor market network strength capturing the flow of information to job seekers and referrals provided to employers. They find that the re-employment probability and thus the network connection is weaker during the Great Recession. Based on German data, Bauer et al. (2011) show that the individual employment probability is negatively affected by the neighborhood unemployment rate. They define neighborhoods using ZIP codes. Postal areas differ considerably in size and are observable, allowing individuals to assess the quality of the neighborhood. In terms of population size, these neighborhoods host on average 7900 individuals starting from 2500 to a maximum of 25,500. In contrast, our neighborhoods contain on average 600 workers and thus are considerably smaller and of equal size which makes it less likely that workers sort into neighborhoods.====Against the background of these two studies, we are able to estimate the effect of the neighborhood’s employment rate on an individual’s probability of finding a new job after a plant closure. Furthermore, our analysis draws on a novel, geo-coded data set based on administrative records in Germany that does not follow administrative frontiers or borders. Besides looking into short- and long-run effects of the neighborhood on workers’ job-finding rates, the data set allows us to evaluate more deeply the economic mechanisms that are likely driving our findings. Information on daily earnings of the displaced workers who found a new job and on their job stability enable us to discriminate between explanations related to social norms, and explanations of information transmission or referrals. As our data set also allows to investigate whether a job seeker finds a job at the plant of a neighbor we are able to further discriminate between information transmission and referrals as job finding mechanisms. Thus, we can add to the existing empirical literature why, how, and for how long social networks matter.====We proceed with a description of our data.

For example, in California 70% of prison inmates were foster children at some point in their lives.==== Meanwhile, national estimates suggest that fully 28% of homeless individuals were once foster youth (Burt, 1999). More broadly, former foster youth have lower levels of employment and educational attainment, while having greater rates of drug use, incarceration, homelessness, unplanned fertility, and welfare recipiency (Havlicek, 2011, Font, Maguire-Jack, 2013, King, Putnam-Hornstein, Cederbaum, Needell, 2014).====Given the perception of foster youth as a highly vulnerable segment of society and the enormous costs associated with crime, incarceration, welfare recipiency and homelessness, there have been movements in recent years intended to alter and improve foster care for all stakeholders. One notable trend has been increased placement of foster children with extended family members (kinship foster care) rather than placement with unrelated foster families (traditional foster care).====Despite considerable usage of kinship care as a placement for foster youth, the practice still represents a minority of placements and is not without controversy.==== Commonly cited benefits to kinship care include a lesser degree of home removal trauma, greater continuity in the child’s life, lower costs to the public and the argument that kinship care providers are potentially more motivated than caregivers that lack a biological bond. Alternatively, disadvantages associated with kinship care are that caregivers are generally older, poorer, less educated, less healthy and less likely to use resources and support services provided by child welfare agencies (Harden et al., 2004). Moreover, kinship providers are often reluctant to limit contact between the child and abusive or neglectful parents (Vanschoonlandt et al., 2012). Finally, many Child Protective Service agents are quick to suggest that children who are removed from their nuclear families may be ill served by being placed with extended family members who may share problematic views and practices with the child’s nuclear family (Peters, 2005). Thus, it remains unclear whether kinship care represents an improvement over traditional foster care and whether case workers and administrators should emphasize one type of labor over another.====Given the theoretical ambiguity of the effects of kinship care, and the high stakes present, there has been a considerable effort to uncover the effects of different foster care placements so that child welfare agencies can make the best decisions possible. An older strand of this primarily sociological literature is ably summarized by Cuddeback (2004), who notes that “the research regarding outcomes of kinship vs. non-kinship care is limited and inconclusive” and notes that future research would do well to consider longitudinal research designs and to account for selection effects.====A more recent literature in economics has sought to improve upon the research designs and data used in earlier studies. Doyle (2007a) leverages a sudden decrease in the Illinois subsidy rate for kinship care relative to non-kinship care to evaluate whether placement type affects children’s health and educational outcomes. As marginal kinship care providers are replaced, Doyle (2007a) finds no evidence that non-kinship care resulted in worse outcomes. Hayduk (2017) leverages changes in US state laws intended to give preferential consideration to kin as potential caregivers. Findings suggest that kinship care is beneficial in terms of placement stability and duration, but that these benefits do not appear to result in improved physical or mental health for children.====Despite recent progress and the tremendous value in determining the true effects of different placements, the most important impacts of foster care placements are relatively understudied. This is first and foremost due to a lack of suitable data. In order to uncover long-run effects that dominate social cost considerations, panel data spanning considerable periods of time are presumably necessary, but until recently have been largely absent. We address data shortcomings through the use of newly available panel data that offers considerable detail and many years of observations for foster youth transitioning to young adulthood.====A second notable difficulty is that rigorous studies of foster care must account for selection effects. Namely, children with different characteristics may systematically receive different placements types, i.e. traditional or kinship, while also being more or less likely to be removed from their homes. Given the potential for selection issues, it is exceedingly difficult to disentangle the effects of placement type from the intrinsic nature of the child and their past experiences. In order to fully account for the presence of all possible selection effects, the ideal experiment would likely need to randomize across both the removal decision and placement type. This experimental ideal would almost certainly be able to yield definitive answers about the relative merits of kinship and traditional care. Given that true randomization across both removal and placement decisions is not presently possible, a quasi-experimental approach is arguably best suited to overcome concerns about the potential for different types of children to be assigned different placement settings.====We seek to address selection issues in placement type by leveraging quasi-randomization through the use of an instrumental variables (IV) approach that has the potential to purge our study of confounding selection effects that relate to placement type. We utilize caregiver monthly compensation levels as our instrument. The core logic of the instrument is that extended family members are less sensitive to monthly caregiver payments than unrelated traditional caregivers. Hence, when compensation is low children are more likely to receive kinship care, and less likely to receive traditional care. Empirically, the instrument is highly predictive of placement as higher compensation levels are strongly correlated with traditional foster care placement, while lower compensation levels strongly predict kinship foster care placement. Our data plausibly indicate that changes in foster care provider compensation alone do not appear to lead to altered outcomes for foster care youth. That being said, it remains a possibility that additional compensation could potentially offer direct benefits to foster youth. If such selection effects indeed exist, it would attenuate, rather than inflate, our findings. Additionally, since compensation standards are determined by state governments in rigorously documented ways, it is plausible that compensation levels are uncorrelated with unobservable child characteristics.====An instrumental variable approach in conjunction with panel data allows us to generate estimates of the impact of kinship foster care relative to traditional foster care for former foster youth in the long run. We consider employment, educational enrollment, social welfare program participation, homelessness, substance abuse and incarceration. Our findings imply long run benefits to kinship foster care. The empirical analysis indicates that compared to children who were placed in traditional foster care, former foster youth that were placed in kinship care are more likely to be employed or in school, less likely to be incarcerated, less likely to be homeless and less likely to receive social welfare benefits. Our findings are both statistically and practically significant, while also being robust to multiple specifications, sensitivity analyses, and sample refinements.====Our paper offers at least two contributions to the extant literature. First, we obtain plausible estimates of the effects of foster care placement types through an instrumental variables identification strategy. Secondly, by using long-term longitudinal data with considerable detail and large numbers of observations, we shed light on many of the adverse outcomes former foster youth face as they transition into adulthood. Our results should be of considerable interest to policy makers that must make important decisions about foster care placement, as well as to researchers interested in human capital formation and the relative costs and benefits of familial labor.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We will revisit key stylized facts about gender gaps in employment and wages in a few high-income countries. We then discuss and build on one gender-neutral force behind the rise in female employment, namely the rise of the service economy. This is also related to the polarization of female employment and to the geographic distribution of jobs, which is expected to be especially relevant for female employment prospects. We finally turn to currently debated causes of remaining gender gaps and discuss existing evidence on labor market consequences of women’s heavier caring responsibilities in the household. In particular, we highlight sharp ==== in commuting behavior and discuss how women’s stronger distaste for commuting time may feed into gender pay gaps.","The twentieth century has witnessed a spectacular rise in women’s participation to the labor market. Around 1900, one in five women of working age was in gainful employment in the US. A hundred years later, the female employment rate had risen to two thirds of the working age population, accompanied by gradual gender convergence in wages and earnings, and the entry of women in occupations traditionally occupied by men (Goldin, 2006). Similar changes were taking place in all economically advanced countries, albeit with varying time lags with respect to the US experience.====These developments have generated a vast body of work, studying womens changing role in the economy and the underlying driving forces. A widely documented phenomenon is the female gain in human capital accumulation, leading to narrowing and then reversing gender gaps in college completion rates.==== Meanwhile, medical advances have reduced fertility via the introduction of oral contraceptives, improved maternal health, and provided substitutes to maternal lactation. Another relevant factor is the introduction of antidiscrimination legislation in most countries, which was more recently accompanied by affirmative action aimed at removing entry barriers in male-dominated, high-income occupations (see Goldin, 2006, Bertrand, 2011, and Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2016, for a discussion of these forces and a survey of the literature). Besides these gender-specific trends, gender-neutral changes such as the rise in the service economy were creating cleaner and less physically demanding jobs in which women may have a comparative advantage, whether innate or acquired (Ngai and Petrongolo, 2017). Closely knit to these economic and institutional changes was the evolution of gender identity norms, which slowly but steadily reshaped women’s aspirations and societal perceptions about appropriate gender roles in the household and the labor market (Goldin, 2006, Bertrand, 2011). Women’s changing role in the labor market has also spurred – and was often reinforced by – government intervention and firm policies targeting families and in particular offering women the opportunity to combine careers and motherhood (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017).====Despite decades of progress, gender convergence has recently slowed down (most notably in the US), and sizable gaps remain in most indicators of gender success. Women in the US earn about 18% less than men (on an hourly basis) and their employment rates are 10 percentage points lower. In the UK, gender differences closely replicate the US picture, with a 20% wage gap and an employment gap of 9 percentage points. In most continental European countries wage gaps are narrower, but employment gaps are substantially larger. In all countries women are still under-represented in high-income, high-status occupations. Large and persistent gaps are especially remarkable in light of equalized education opportunities and equal pay legislation gradually adopted in most countries since World War II.====The causes of remaining gender inequalities are actively debated in current labor research. While traditional human capital factors such as education and experience can no longer explain earnings or employment differentials, other aspects of labor market attachment still seem to differ between men and women. A strand of the literature has highlighted gender differences in preferences and psychological traits, whether innate or shaped by social contexts, leading to women’s underrepresentation in the upper part of the earnings distribution. Based on experimental evidence from the lab and, more recently, from real-world settings, a large body of work has documented some gender differences in attitudes towards risk, competition and negotiation, which may interfere with labor market success whenever financially rewarding careers develop in highly-competitive environments, characterized by volatile earnings (see Croson, Gnezy, 2009, Bertrand, 2011, and Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014, for surveys). Among studies that directly relate such differences in attitudes to the gender gap in earnings, the portion of the earnings gap explained remains relatively modest (Blau and Kahn, 2017).====Another strand of work has mostly emphasized women’s role of primary providers of childcare and home production, which sets limits to their labor market engagement. As a likely consequence of worklife balance considerations, women typically work shorter or more irregular hours than men, are more likely to take career breaks, and specialize in different occupations and industries. These work dimensions may only marginally contribute to differential accumulation of actual work experience, but could still contribute to gender gaps via differences in job search behavior and compensating pay differentials associated to job characteristics especially favored by women, such as short or flexible hours, atypical work arrangements, or shorter commutes, to name a few (Goldin, 2014, Blau, Kahn, 2017, Bertrand, 2018). Indeed, childbirth drives large and persistent wedges between the earnings of mothers and fathers (Kleven et al., 2019a).====In this paper we discuss some strands of the recent literature on the evolution of gender gaps and their driving forces, expanding on our previous work on these topics and exploring avenues for future research.==== We will start in Section 2 by revisiting a few stylized facts about gender gaps in employment and wages in a few high-income countries. Most of the evidence presented refers to the US and the UK, with a few comparisons with major continental European countries. Section 3 discusses and builds on one gender-neutral force behind the rise in female employment, namely the rise of the service economy, to the detriment of the manufacturing sector and home-produced services, and will describe how both mechanisms may be conducive to a rise in female employment. We will then relate the growth in service jobs to the polarization of employment, which in the US is much more pronounced for women than for men, and to the geographic distribution of jobs, which is predicted to be especially relevant for female employment prospects. Section 4 will turn to currently debated causes of remaining gender gaps and discusses potential labor market consequences of women’s heavier caring responsibilities in the household. In particular, we will highlight how women’s stronger distaste for commuting time may feed into gender pay gaps by limiting women’s job opportunities. Evidence for a few countries shows that women on average commute shorter distances than men, and that the age profile in the gender commuting gap closely mimics the age profile in the earnings gap. Relatedly, women gain less than men from job mobility in terms of earnings, but gain more in terms of vicinity to new workplaces, consistent with stronger willingness than men to trade off wage gains for shorter commutes.

Most employed women significantly gained from the reform, but high ==== were disadvantaged. Using Reproductive Health Survey data, I analyze the effects on live births, conceptions, abortions and early life child outcomes. The change in financial incentives did not influence short term conception rates but significantly decreased the probability of abortion, by a very large margin, leading to more live births. Outcomes related to early life chid development, such as prenatal maternal investments, child health at birth and breastfeeding, do not appear to be affected in the short run by the large average increase in maternity leave benefits.","Over the last six decades, there has been a remarkable decline in the total fertility rate, which decreased by almost 50%; nearly half of the world’s countries now have below replacement rate fertility rates (Murray et al., 2018). At the same time, the “quantity-quality” trade-off should imply that the change in the number of children families are having is likely to be accompanied by changes in parental investments and hence quality of children. In this context, understanding if and what policies affect fertility, and how they also impact child outcomes is not only of academic interest, but also highly policy relevant.====Subsidizing childbearing to encourage fertility has long been a policy objective in numerous (developed) countries; as such, parental leave benefits, in the form of entitlements to leave with job protection and most often income compensation, after the birth of children, have become a salient part of family policies. All OECD countries with the exception of the US implement government funded policies granting paid leave for employed parents; however, the design of these benefits differs significantly across countries in terms of income replacement rates and the lengths of protected leave and/or duration of benefit receipt. There has also been a shift towards more generous policies, with average duration of the leave in OECD countries increasing from 14 weeks in 1980 to 53 in 2018.==== But despite their wide implementation, there is still relatively scarce evidence of the effects of parental leave policies on fertility, and particularly the effects of their financial component, mostly due to difficulties in finding exogenous changes in the opportunity cost of children, but also due to the fact that changes in these policies are typically small and gradual. Parental leave benefits were initially available only to mothers, hence being referred to as “maternity leave benefits”; although nowadays they are (in most countries) available to both parents, mothers still take a significantly larger share of the available protected leave after the birth of children.====In this paper, I exploit an unexpected and significant change in the maternity leave policy in Romania to investigate the effects of (large) changes in the financial incentives component of maternity leave benefits on fertility and early life child outcomes. An important contribution of this analysis is that in addition to the effect on live births, I investigate the effects on conceptions and abortions, which are not observed in register data. For the early life child outcomes, I investigate the effects on maternal prenatal behaviors, health outcomes at the birth of the child and early investments in child’s human capital. The policy change used for identification was announced in 2003 and implemented in 2004 in Romania, and radically changed the way in which parental leave benefits, at the time available only to mothers, were awarded. Prior to the policy change, maternity leave benefits were awarded proportional to the mother’s pre-birth earnings. The monthly benefit amounted to 85% of the taxable average earnings over the 6 months preceding childbirth, and was awarded for a maximum of two years. After a radical and unexpected policy change, the benefits requested after January 1, 2004 were awarded as a fixed sum equal to 85% of the national average salary of both men and women. Because of a very large gender gap in wages, calculating the fixed maternity leave benefits in reference to the national average salary meant that more than 80% of employed women would potentially gain from the reform; moreover, the potential increase in nominal terms was very large, the fixed benefit being one third higher than the average (potential) proportional benefit in the previous regime, with much larger increases for low earning women. Benefits requested prior to that date were unaffected and continued to be calculated proportional to each mother’s pre-birth earnings. The policy change also entailed an increase in the required tax contribution period (work requirement), from 6 to 10 months prior to the birth of the child. This policy change significantly altered the opportunity cost of childbearing for employed mothers, but did not affect out of the labor force women, as they were not entitled to receive this type of benefit.====The Becker model of fertility (Becker, 1991) predicts that the relative increase (decrease) in maternity leave benefits will lead to higher (lower) fertility levels, but also to a decreased (increased) quality of children. Quality of children is influenced by prenatal investments, child health at birth and early investments in infant health. However, in addition to the price effect, the change in maternity leave benefits also induces an income effect, which may affect investments in the quality of children in the opposite direction, leading to an ambiguous net effect on the quality of children. This paper aims to bring empirical evidence of the short term effects of maternity leave benefits on the quantity and quality of children, in a reduced form; however, due to the nature of the data, it cannot speak of whether the fertility effects are quantum or tempo effects.====The analysis uses the 2004 wave of the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey (RHS-Ro), which includes detailed information about all pregnancies, irrespective of how they ended, and multiple health outcomes for the youngest child, for each woman in the representative sample. The primary strategy to identify the effects of the policy change announcement is a difference-in-differences design that exploits the fact that only employed women were affected by the policy change, and uses housewives (out of the labor force women) as a control group, as they were, theoretically, unaffected by the policy. I compare the pregnancies occurring in between March and June 2003, thus potentially affected by the policy change and compare them to pregnancies conceived in the same months of the previous 3 years. The findings indicate that in the post policy change announcement period, employed women had small and insignificant increases in conception rates, but very large and significant decreases in abortion probabilities relative to housewife women, suggesting that abortion is the relevant margin of changing fertility in Romania. As a consequence, the number of live births also increased significantly post announcement. The effect is driven by women from less well-off households, who most likely benefited from the policy change, with women from richer households having, if anything, an opposite behavior. The effects on early life child outcomes are small and mostly insignificant, suggesting that mothers do not immediately adjust their investment behavior as a consequence of changed financial incentives.====This paper speaks to the literature on the relationship between financial incentives and fertility, its main contribution being the comprehensive analysis of reproductive behavior and early investments in child health as a response to changes in financial incentives. Due to the nature of the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey, I am able explore the entire spectrum of individual level decisions related to fertility: occurrence of pregnancy (conception), decision to carry the pregnancy to term, and several important outcomes conditional on live birth, such as maternal behavior during pregnancy, child health at birth and early investments in child health, whereas previous studies analyze outcomes conditional on pregnancies being carried to term====, and in very few cases aggregate number of abortions====. Analyzing the effects on the probability of abortion is especially relevant and interesting in the Romanian context since abortion rates have been, historically, among the highest in Europe after their (re)liberalization in 1990. The abortion rate in Romania in 2002 was of 1174 abortions per 1000 live births, relative to an European average of 274 abortions per 1000 live births (source: World Health Organization), and abortions were regarded as a contraception method. In this setting, it is very important to understand if financial incentives can influence this aspect of reproductive behavior.====Secondly, the Romanian policy reform modified only the level of the financial benefits attached to childbirth for employed mothers, and not the length of time for which they were awarded.==== Other policies previously used for identification entailed a change in both the financial benefits and the length of time of protected employment, making it more difficult to disentangle the effects attributable to monetary incentives.==== This paper investigates the exclusive role of pecuniary incentives in determining fertility and early investments in child health. Finally, the policy change exploited in this paper affected a very large share of the population,by a large margin and applied to births of any rank, which increases the external validity of the findings.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the theoretical considerations and presents related work. Section 3 presents the details of the Romanian policy reform affecting the maternity leave benefits. Section 4 describes the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey and the identification strategy.

We consider large multi-establishment companies and distinguish two types of organization of recruitment: hiring made through a human resources (HR) department at a centralized level of the company and hiring made at only the level of the establishment concerned by the position, generally by managers in charge of recruitment. Our results indicate that access to a centralized HR department in the selection of applications has an important effect on the level of discrimination, i.e., this type of organization of recruitment results in a significant decrease in the probability that applicants with native-sounding names are solely selected.","In many countries, experiments conducted in recent years have revealed a relatively widespread discriminatory behaviour among employers (see Baert, 2018, Bertrand, Duflo, 2017, Neumark, 2018, Rich, 2014 for literature reviews). Several recent works have studied different actions to prevent this discrimination. The introduction of anonymous resumes is the most studied policy. However, the results are mixed. Behaghel et al. (2015) show that setting up an experimental anonymous resume policy is not efficient for ethnic minorities in France. In contrast, Aslund and Skans (2012) find an increase in the number of interviews for both ethnic minorities and women in Sweden. Krause et al. (2012) conclude that the method of implementation of the policy is a crucial factor in obtaining a positive impact. Some other studies focus on the content of the resumes. Fremigacci et al. (2015) assess the potential impact of merit labelling by making the ”best apprentice in France” distinction appear on the resume. However, this attempt was not effective in reducing discrimination because, although all applicants benefits from this distinction, those with a native-sounding name benefit more than other groups. Edo and Jacquemet (2013) evaluate the impact of a satisfactory level of native language on resumes. Their results are more encouraging than the results in the literature because such a signal makes it possible to reduce the differences observed. Another type of policy is the introduction of diversity in hiring committees to reduce discrimination. Bertrand and Duflo (2017) gather the literature on this topic. They point out that the results on discrimination are not obvious and could even be negative (see, for instance, Bagues, Sylos-Labini, Zinovyeva, 2017, Bagues, Esteve-Volart, 2010, Bursell, 2007, Zinovyeva, Bagues, 2011). Overall, few tools have proven effective in fighting discrimination in recruitment and more research on this point is worth pursuing.====In this article, we assess the effect of the organization of recruitment in large companies on the degree of hiring discrimination. More specifically, we compare the intervention of a centralized human resources (HR) department to the selection made only within the establishment concerned by the position, generally by a manager responsible for recruitment. We expect a lower rate of discrimination for three reasons. HR professionals are better trained and more aware than other recruiters regarding discrimination. HR professionals are also less influenced by local constraints that can generate discrimination (e.g., conforming to consumer preferences or seeking to maintain homogeneous teams to facilitate their management). Finally, HR professionals also have more time to devote to the selection of applications and therefore make their choices less often on the basis of stereotypes (Chugh, 2004).====To conduct our analysis, we use the data from a correspondence study realized by the French Ministry of Labour (Foroni et al., 2016). We find a net discrimination rate of 20.2% against second-generation immigrants, which is the lower bound of the literature,==== but in line with Carlsson and Rooth (2007) and Kaas and Manger (2012), who find that the net discrimination rate decreases with the size of the firm. The aim of this experiment was to establish a dialogue with some large companies about their recruitment practices on the basis of the experimental results and encourage them to implement policies to prevent discrimination. This dialogue was also an opportunity to gather information related to the recruitment process for each job offer, in addition to those related to the experimental design. Thus, we can distinguish recruitment for which the selection was made through a centralized HR department of the company (e.g., at national or regional levels), by an external service provider, or by a person in charge of hiring if the recruitment was managed at the level of the establishment the offer concerns.====In this paper, we evaluate the impact of centralized HR recruitment on the degree of discrimination in large companies. Approximately two-thirds of the tested job offers are managed in this manner, while the other job offers are managed solely at the establishment level. Notably, because we consider very large companies, the organization of recruitment varies across job offers and not only across companies. Indeed, data show intra-firm heterogeneity in terms of organization of recruitment for many companies. Next, because the organization of recruitment is potentially endogenous, we use an instrument to evaluate a causal effect. We exploit the information regarding whether the tested job offer is from a company that developed a franchising network.====Our results suggest that acting on the organization of recruitment in large companies can be considered a relatively effective tool in the fight against discrimination in recruitment, at least as far as the first stage of recruitment is concerned. Centralized HR departments lead to a significant decrease in the probability that applicants with a native-sounding name are preferred.====The study is organized as follows.

Based on Italian individual-level administrative data, our analysis focuses on new hires in temporary and open-ended contracts for the period of 2005–2015. To estimate the presence of differentials over the daily wage distribution, we follow Firpo (2007) and implement an inverse probability estimator, which allows us to control for labour market history, including lagged outcomes, over the last 16 years. Our results show the existence of a premium for temporary contracts over the full distribution of daily remuneration at entry, confirming the ==== of equalizing differences. The wage premium is greater when permanent contracts are more valuable, such as for ‘marginalised’ categories like female, young, and low-paid temporary workers, and during the years of the economic crisis. The gap remains substantial after taking into account differences in working hours between workers.","Wage inequality has always existed. As each person differs in terms of skills, attitude, opportunities, and background, it must not be surprising whether two or more individuals earn different levels of salary. Thereby, wage inequality may not represent an issue by itself, but some of its determinants do. Understanding what drives wage inequality is very important considering it has grown constantly over the last decades (Devicienti, Fanfani, Maida, 2019, Felbermayr, Impullitti, Prat, 2018, Lemieux, 2006).====Another contemporaneous phenomenon in the labour market of several countries is the increasing diffusion of temporary contracts. From constituting only a small minority of jobs, they have become the main channel of entry into the labour markets of several southern European countries characterised by a strong duality. While these contracts have been introduced with the idea of providing flexible labour to employers and facilitating the occupational activation of ‘marginalised’ categories, their diffusion might have also contributed to a widening wage inequality and partly explains its recent increasing trend.====The existence of a wage gap between temporary and permanent workers is predicted by economic theory. According to Rosen (1986), temporary workers should receive higher wages as ‘compensation’ for their less favourable job conditions. However, most empirical research has found that temporary workers receive a wage penalty rather than a ‘wage premium’ (e.g. Blanchard, Landier, 2002, Boeri, 2011, Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002, Gebel, 2010, Kahn, 2016). According to these studies, the wage penalty reported by temporary workers may be due to their lower levels of bargaining power, training and labour productivity, as well as expectations of conversion into a higher-paid permanent contract in the future.====In this study, we aim to provide further insight on the role of temporary contracts in shaping wage inequality. Identifying the influence of temporary contracts on wage inequality is challenging, however, due to several confounding factors. First, the composition of workers hired into the two types of contracts is likely to differ due to more selective hiring processes for permanent jobs. Second, even if assignment in the two contracts was as good as random, selective attrition along the job spell is likely to modify the composition of the two groups in a different way. For example, we may expect the more highly skilled temporary workers may be ‘promoted’ to permanent jobs (Elia, 2010), which changes the skill composition of the two groups in favour of permanent jobs along the job spell. Both selections would bias the estimates in the direction of lower wages for temporary contracts.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, the previous literature relied on stock samples of workers, whose composition may be affected by dynamic sorting. To avoid this issue, we focus on an inflow sample of new hires and compare their gross daily wages at hiring.====Second, while most of the previous literature has used survey data, we rely on administrative data due to the richer longitudinal dimension, larger sample size, and lower risk of misreporting. We draw a sample of more than 3 million new hires during the period of 2005–2015 from Italian administrative registries (LoSai INPS), which cover about 6.5% of employees in the salaried private sector. We focus on Italy as an interesting case study because the share of temporary workers out of the total number of employees substantially increased in recent decades, such that they represent the majority of new hires each year (67.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018, Ministry of Labor and Social Policies, 2019). By exploiting the rich panel structure of the data, we control for selection at hiring in the two contracts taking into account occupational history over the last 16 years, which importantly includes lagged wages and contracts. We implement a flexible inverse probability weighting estimator to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), where the estimand of interest is the wage earned by individuals hired into permanent jobs, conditional on a similar employment history to those hired in temporary ones.====Third, we gain further insight into the potential mechanisms by taking advantage of the large sample. First of all, since wage inequality is partially related to differences in terms of working hours among employees (Checchi, Garcia-Peñalosa, Vivian, 2018, Ciani, Torrini, 2019, Vaughan-Whitehead, Vazquez-Alvarez, 2018), we run estimates both for all hires and the ones in full-time jobs only. Moreover, we estimate the unconditional quantile treatment effect on the treated (QTT), as proposed by (Firpo, 2007), to determine whether wage inequality changes over the distribution. Finally, we estimate heterogeneous effects by individual characteristics (i.e. gender, age, and macro-region of residence), year of hiring, sector, and type of temporary contract. Indeed, differences in wage inequality are expected over different categories of individuals. For example, on the one hand, ‘marginalised’ categories such as female, young, and low-skilled workers may be negatively affected by temporary contracts given their lower bargaining power, unlike other workers who may receive a wage premium to accept a flexible contract. On the other hand, the intrinsic value of an open-ended contract may be higher for ‘marginalised’ individuals, who might be willing to work in a permanent job for a lower wage.====The descriptive evidence is in line with previous empirical research showing a wage penalty for full-time temporary contracts. However, we reach different conclusions after controlling for positive selection into permanent contracts. We estimate an average premium at entry for temporary contracts of about 11.3 percentages points (pp). The differences are smaller for full-time jobs (9.5 pp), which indicates the presence of inequality in working hours in favour of temporary employment. However, in contrast with the previous literature, our evidence corroborates the theory of equalizing differences (Rosen, 1986), which states that an individual may prefer a temporary contract over an open-ended one only in the presence of a wage premium, due to the intrinsic value of permanent jobs. This interpretation is also supported by estimations on the quantiles and of heterogeneity, which show a larger premium for low-skilled workers, women, youths, and during the years of the economic crisis. The premium is therefore larger for categories of workers for whom this intrinsic value is probably higher. Results are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, such as a placebo test on the lagged dependent variable (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009) and the relatively large confounder that would be needed to invalidate our results (Rosenbaum, 2002). A second estimation approach based on a fixed-effect estimator exploiting the entry into different contracts by the same individuals also confirms an average premium for temporary contracts at hiring.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains a review of studies focusing on wage inequality and temporary contracts. Section 3 presents the institutional setting. Section 4 describes the administrative data and sample selection. The descriptive evidence is presented in Section 5, while Section 6 explains the empirical strategy we use to estimate the wage gap between temporary and open-ended contracts.

Using longitudinal data on couples in Germany, we control for fixed household specific effects and allow for endogeneity of retirement using both a regression discontinuity approach and variation in the early and full retirement age across cohorts and with labour market history. Furthermore, we separately estimate the effect of retirement and the effect of lay-off due to an exogenous shock (i.e. plant closure) for each spouse. For both men and women, a transition from work to retirement significantly increases the amount of their own home production. Similar effects are found for other (layoff induced) exits from work. We find much smaller negative cross-effects of retirement or other exits from work on time spent on home production done by the male partner; the effect of the husband's retirement on the wife's home production is not statistically significant.","Retirement is one of the main economic and social changes in the lives of most individuals and their households. Most people retire abruptly from a full-time job to a situation where they no longer take part in paid work. This not only affects their personal and household income, but also their social network and the activities on which they spend their time. For individuals in couples, retirement of husband or wife may have an important impact on the partner through household income, but also through the changes in the time spent by the retired partner on, for example, household production (e.g., errands, housework, care and support for other household members, repairs on and around the house, etc.) or (joint) leisure activities. The cross-effects of retirement on the partner have been used in the retirement literature to explain, for example, the stylized fact that many couples retire at almost the same point in time, in spite of an age difference (Hurd, 1990; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2000, 2009).====The economics literature has emphasized the stylized fact that household consumption expenditures drop substantially upon retirement of the main earner, known as the retirement consumption puzzle (Hamermesh, 1984; Banks et al., 1998).==== Several explanations for this puzzle have been given, such as unexpected retirement (Haider and Stephens, 2007), uncertainty about the timing of retirement (Blau, 2008), a reduction in work related expenses (Battistin et al., 2009), or a fall in required consumption expenditures to achieve a given welfare level due to an increase in time spent on household production activities (Hurst, 2008). Aguiar and Hurst (2005, 2007) find that after retirement, individuals in the US spend more time on shopping and preparing food, leading to a lower effective price of food consumption. Hurd and Rohwedder (2008) find that in the US, retirement increases the time men and women spend on house cleaning and the time men spend on home improvements and gardening, probably reducing the need for expenditures on outsourcing.====Unlike the studies mentioned above, Stancanelli and van Soest (2012) also consider the effect of retirement of one partner on the time spent on home production by the other partner. Using cross-section data on French couples around retirement age, they find that men respond to their wives’ retirement by significantly reducing the time they allocate to home production, while there is no significant effect of men's retirement on their wives’ hours of home production. Battistin et al. (2009), Ciani (2016) and Stancanelli and van Soest (2012) account for the potential endogeneity of retirement decisions by exploiting a regression discontinuity approach, based upon the minimum age for receiving retirement benefits. Aguiar and Hurst (2005) also allow for endogeneity of retirement, but make the stronger assumption that age can be used as an instrument for retirement. None of these studies used panel data.====In this study, we use longitudinal data for German couples in the age group 45 – 75, followed over time from 1991 until 2016. The data set not only contains rich background information, but also has survey information on the time spent on various activities relating to home production and leisure, similar to the time use information in the HRS consumption and activities module (see Hurd and Rohwedder, 2008).====This type of retrospective survey information has certain drawbacks compared to the detailed diary information typically collected in specific time use surveys. Previous studies have shown, however, that it does lead to reliable results in multivariate analyses where the focus is not on the absolute amounts of time spent on certain activities but on the relations between time use and other variables (Bonke, 2005; Kitterød and Lyngstad, 2005). Moreover, an important advantage of these data is their unique longitudinal nature,====We simultaneously estimate the effect of retirement and the effect of not working for other reasons of both partners on the time spent on home production of each of them. We use discontinuities in the retirement probability induced by pension eligibility ages to identify the effects of retirement, and use exogenous variation induced by plant closure to identify the effect of not working for other reasons. Since the validity of the latter instrument is more plausible if unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity is controlled for, we exploit the panel dimension of the data and include fixed effects in all equations. We present a number of sensitivity checks in the Online Appendix. Our results are rather robust for the chosen specification and the identifying assumptions.====We find that a transition from paid work into retirement significantly increases own home production. Depending on the specification, it increases home production by 8–14 h per week for men and by 7–11 h per week for women. The effects of other exits from work are similar and even somewhat larger. We find much smaller negative cross-effects of the wife's exit from work into retirement on home production done by the husband, limiting the effect on total household production in the household; the effect of the husband's retirement on the wife's home production is not statistically significant.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

I use data on age cohorts 15–24 between 1980 and 2007 and estimate the causal effect of exposure to female politicians during young adulthood on later life female labor market outcomes. To address the endogeneity of electoral preferences, I use close elections between male and female candidates, won by a woman, as an instrument for female political representation in a district. I find that exposure to female politicians during young adulthood leads to a large increase in the probability of women working in wage employment, specifically from areas with less entrenched gender bias, but has limited effect on self-employment or casual work. There is a corresponding increase in the likelihood of completing higher secondary education and selecting into sales, service, and clerical occupations in the private sector, which require a higher level of education. The evidence suggests that the employment effects are consistent with dual channels of a policy role and changing aspirations of young girls due to role modeling.","Declining female labor force participation (FLFP) in India is a policy concern as it can impede the country's growth potential. Between 2005 and 2012, 19.6 million women left the labor force, and FLFP declined from 42.6% to 31% (Andres et al., 2017). Inclusive growth is important as women's employment and income can increase their bargaining power and have spillover effects on their children's well-being (Duflo, 2003; Qian, 2008). Apart from structural features of the economy,==== social norms about appropriateness of women engaging in market work are an important constraint to low levels of FLFP.==== Jayachandran (2015) identifies role models as a policy approach to show what is feasible for women to attain and influence social norms on gender attitudes. Female politicians, as public role models, can affect FLFP through policy measures and changes in women's aspirations and social norms (Beaman et al., 2012).====Previous research has shown that women's political representation results in policies and welfare effects favorable to women and children,==== but there is limited evidence of the labor market consequences of electing women. To address this gap, this paper uses the National Sample Survey (NSS) 2011–2012 to study whether exposure to female politicians during young adulthood affect women's labor market outcomes later in life. I exploit district-level variation in exposure to female politicians in state legislatures, at ages 15–24 across cohorts from 1980–2007, to assess the impact on women's choice of economic activity. I find that exposure at ages 18–20 leads to a large increase in the probability of women working in wage employment as an adult, with limited effect on self-employment or casual work. Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in female politicians, equivalent to an additional politician in the median district, results in a 2.5 percentage point increase in wage employment corresponding to an increase of 42%.====Causal identification of the effect of elected female politicians requires addressing the endogeneity of electoral preferences, which can be correlated with both FLFP and female political representation. To overcome endogeneity bias, I use an instrumental variable derived from a fuzzy regression discontinuity. I follow the estimation strategy of Clots-Figueras (2012) and Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras (2014) and use the fraction of seats won by women in close elections against male candidates, as an instrument for the fraction of seats won by women in a district. The identifying assumption is that the gender identity of the winner in close mixed-gender elections is quasi-random and does not indicate a clear electoral preference for women.====Existing evidence on labor market outcomes shows that female politicians in reserved seats at local levels of government in India, where a constitutional amendment in 1993 introduced quotas for women in village councils, increased household-based women-owned establishments in the informal manufacturing sector (Ghani et al., 2014), self-employment in farming (Deininger et al., 2012), and allocation of work to women in public works programs (Bose and Das, 2018; Ghani et al., 2019) with no effect on wage employment. Implementation of the quotas has been linked to an increase in young women's education and occupation aspirations (Beaman et al., 2012), improved perception of women in leadership roles and weakening of gender stereotypes (Beaman et al., 2009), changes in gender-discriminatory behavior (Kalsi, 2017), and provision of public goods favorable to women (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), all of which can stimulate women's workforce participation.====In contrast to these earlier studies, a distinguishing feature of this paper is to focus on exposure at a critical, formative period of young adulthood when norms, aspirations, and expectations are shaped, and important decisions regarding transitioning into higher levels of education and employment are made. Second, I examine the role of women elected to state legislatures.==== The role and background of politicians vary considerably at these two levels of government with implications for the pathways of their policy influence==== and the type of constituents that find them to be relevant role models. There are also limitations to generalizing the effect of quotas,==== as it can change political competition through changes in candidate quality and voter preferences (Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras, 2014; Clots-Figueras, 2012).====I examine and discuss two pathways that could affect women's wage employment, namely a role model or policy channel, recognizing that multiple channels could be at work simultaneously. Role models can change the reference point of prevailing norms (Ray, 2006) and revise individual aspirations and expectations, which can, in turn, affect economic outcomes (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). Research from social psychology shows that individuals are impressionable to perception change during late adolescence and early adulthood (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989). In line with this interpretation, I find that the effect on later life employment is linked to exposure during young adulthood and not explained by contemporaneous exposure. The results are driven by areas with less entrenched gender bias underlining the importance of a broader enabling environment for this role model effect to manifest.====Plausible policy roles include direct creation of employment opportunities and the provision of public goods. The effects are not due to opportunities in the public sector; rather, the results are driven by private sector employment. In fact, women are more likely to select into service, sales, and clerical occupations that are less socially stigmatized and require completion of secondary education. Consistent with this, I find that having a female politician in power in the years prior to starting higher secondary school increases the probability of women, but not men, completing this level of education. More broadly, female politicians could provide policy support that is beneficial for men and women alike since I also find an increase in men's workforce participation, including labor re-allocation from casual work to self-employment.====This paper shows that in addition to directly influencing women's participation and entry into politics in India (Bhalotra et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2018), female politicians in state legislatures can also affect broader labor market outcomes for women through dual channels of a policy and a role model effect. In addition to documenting substantial economic spillovers of women's representation in politics, the paper also identifies critical periods of young adulthood when such exposure can have a long-lasting impact on bolstering women's economic advancement.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

This scheme entitles youths with no or little labor market experience to unemployment benefits after a waiting period of one year. As of 2015, the Belgian government unexpectedly scrapped benefit eligibility for youths who start the waiting period at the age of 24 or older. The reform implied a change from an inclining to a flat rate (zero-level) benefit profile. We use a difference-in-differences approach to identify the causal impact of this reform on fresh university graduates. Our main finding is that this reform only increases the transition to very short-lived jobs.","Developed countries usually provide some form of social protection to financially support young labor market entrants in case they do not directly find insurable employment. In most countries this consists in a means-tested welfare benefit, but in some others freshly educated youths are entitled to unemployment insurance (UI). Such a scheme is often accompanied by strong eligibility conditions to contain moral hazard costs. In Australia and New Zealand UI is provided immediately upon registration as job seeker, but imposes very strict job search requirements. In Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg entitlement to UI is subject to less stringent job search obligations (Langenbucher, 2015), but is postponed by a waiting period.==== In Sweden, until 2007 high school graduates were entitled to unemployment benefits (UB) only from age 20 onwards (von Buxhoeveden, 2019).====In Belgium, the focus of our analysis, there is a one-year waiting period between the time that youths enter the job market and the moment they become eligible for UI benefits. This aims at keeping work incentives high in the school-to-work transition. As of 2015, the Belgian government unexpectedly scrapped the entitlement to these benefits for youths who start the waiting period at the age of 24 or older. With an average age of graduation from master programs slightly above 24 in Belgium, this decision affected in particular master's graduates. In this paper we empirically test whether this reform affected their work incentives within one year and a half following labor market entry. The way the reform has been implemented offers a unique natural experiment to study this question. The 24-year-old graduates who registered for the first time as unemployed job seekers in 2014 were informed by surprise in January 2015 that they were no longer entitled to UI at the end of their waiting period. By contrast, graduates aged 23 at first registration in 2014 remained entitled. This therefore naturally allows to evaluate the effects of the reform on employment outcomes in a difference-in-differences approach.====Before 2015, UI for young labor market entrants in Belgium displayed an unusual inclining benefit profile. In such a setting, work incentives are maximal at the start of the zero-benefit waiting period. Later on, as one approaches the end of this period, standard job search theory (Mortensen, 1977 and van den Berg, 1990) predicts that homogeneous forward-looking agents progressively decrease search effort and increase their reservation wage. These behavioral reactions result in decreasing job finding rates, better job matches and higher earnings. The 2015 reform that completely abolishes the entitlement to this inclining profile is therefore expected to reverse these predictions. Relative to the counterfactual of no policy reform, job finding is expected to gradually increase and the quality of found jobs to decrease as the end of the waiting period is approached.====There is ample empirical evidence that reducing the generosity of social benefits positively impacts job finding and that recipients anticipate by accelerating their transitions to employment well before benefits exhaust (see for a survey Tatsiramos and Van Ours, 2014, or Schmieder and von Wachter, 2016). There is, however, to the best of our knowledge, not any evidence on the impact on job finding of a change from an increasing profile of UI benefits to a flat rate (zero-level) benefit profile. Based on the arguments of Kolsrud et al. (2018), we may actually expect that such a change has only small positive effects on job finding rates. Dynamic sorting and negative duration dependence in job finding rates imply that youths who are sensitive to monetary incentives may already have left unemployment before the prospect of losing entitlement to UI starts to play a role on behavior. In the Belgian UI scheme for youth, no benefits are paid-out at the start, so that these incentives are very strong initially. Hence, the dynamic sorting will progress at a faster rate than in regular UI. To this can be added the predictions of the calibrated life-cycle model of Michelacci and Ruffo (2015). They conclude that moral hazard is less an issue for youth than for prime aged workers because the young want to be employed anyway as to improve life-time career prospects.====Researchers have not only studied the impact of UI generosity on job finding. There is also ample but mixed evidence about its effect on job quality.==== Nekoei and Weber (2017) explain why it is so in the case of the impact of an extension of benefit duration. While an extension raises the reservation wage, the more selective acceptance behavior implies that individuals remain longer unemployed which in turn reduces job quality. This lower quality can be caused by the employers’ screening of job applicants based on unemployment duration (Kroft et al., 2013) or by a reduced selectivity of long-term unemployed as a consequence of liquidity constraints (Chetty, 2008; Card et al., 2007). The reform analyzed in this paper may have a similar ambiguous effect on job quality. On the one hand, the prospect of not qualifying for UB is likely to induce many unemployed youths to become less selective in their job acceptance decision. On the other hand, the reform may also induce young graduates to find jobs earlier in the unemployment spell when higher quality jobs are available (Lindner and Reizer, 2019). The last channel requires, however, that the reform effectively induces youths to accelerate job finding early in the waiting period, which we do not expect given the length of this period. The first channel should therefore dominate and drive a negative effect of the reform on job quality.====This is not the first study of the behavioral effects of waiting periods for UI or welfare benefits. However, the existing papers have focused on the effect of introducing such qualifying periods (Bolhaar et al., 2019) or extending their duration (Cockx and Van Belle, 2019). Other research has studied instead the effect on work incentives of receiving benefit payments after a period of no-pay status (Bargain and Doorley, 2011; von Buxhoeveden, 2019). In contrast to these studies, we contribute to the literature by analyzing the impact on work incentives of abolishing the entitlement to UI benefits when a waiting period is completed. As we will show in this study, the length of such period is an important determinant of employment responses to such a scheme.====Our analysis uses administrative population data of all recent master's graduates who registered for the first time as unemployed job seeker at the regional Public Employment Services (PES) between 2011 and 2014. For privacy reasons we only have access to data grouped by age and period of registration. Since not all employment outcomes are measured in the same way across regions, the analysis is performed separately for the two main regions of Belgium: Flanders and Wallonia. Cumulative job finding rates are observed six, twelve and eighteen months after registration. The rates measured after six and twelve months are used to study the behavioral anticipation of the prospect of losing entitlement to UI, while the one measured after eighteen months allows to detect the (additional) ex-post effect of actually losing benefit eligibility. In Wallonia job finding includes jobs lasting as short as one day, while in Flanders a job transition is registered only to the extent it is still ongoing at the end of the month. To estimate the effect on short-lived jobs in this region, we therefore use an indicator of transitions to temporary help agency work (temp jobs for short) that the Flemish PES registers separately. Because there may be a trade-off between rapid job finding and lasting integration on the job market, our range of outcomes also includes the probability of being employed measured at the same time horizons as the job finding rate.====The empirical results deliver two main messages. First, they provide clear evidence that the prospect of losing UI eligibility increases the transition to very short-lived jobs. In Flanders, in the absence of the policy reform, 9.0% (resp. 12.1%) of the 24-year-old master's graduates registered as job seekers would have found a temp job within 6 (resp. 12) months after registration. The policy reform caused a significant increase of this fraction by 3.3 (3.7) percentage points. Effects of a similar order of magnitude are estimated in Wallonia on cumulative transitions to employment lasting at least one day, although less precisely. There is, however, no evidence of an additional effect of the policy reform when the eligibility loss has become a tangible reality, i.e. one year and a half after registration. Second, when we consider the effects on transitions to more stable jobs (ongoing at the end of the month) and on employment probabilities, the impacts are at all moments of observation small and statistically not significantly different from zero. In sum, our findings suggest that the reform has only accelerated transitions to short-term labor contracts which did not serve as a stepping stone to stable employment.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the institutional context, the policy reform and the natural experiment it entails. Section 3 takes a first look at our dataset and provides the exact definition of the employment outcomes of interest. Section 4 discusses the methodology and Section 5 presents the results.

We confronted three cohorts of undergraduate students with a set of bonus questions and the choice between an absolute and a tournament grading scheme for these questions. To test the moderating impact of task difficulty, we (randomly) varied the difficulty of the questions between treatment groups. We find that, on average, women are significantly less likely to select the tournament scheme. However, the results show that the gender gap in tournament entry is sizable when the questions are relatively easy, but much smaller and statistically insignificant when the questions are difficult.","Despite overall convergence over the past decades, substantial differences between men and women in educational and labor market outcomes remain.

In addition, there still is a significant gender pay gap (Blau, Kahn, 2017, Petrongolo, 2019). Women are in particular heavily underrepresented in high earning jobs at the top of the corporate ladder (Cook, Glass, 2014, Fortin, Bell, Böhm, 2017). In US Fortune 500 companies, for example, only around one out of five board seats is held by a woman (Deloitte, 2019). Likewise, in the largest publicly listed companies in the European Union, about one quarter of the board members is female (European Commission, 2018). To narrow this gap, several countries (e.g. Norway, France, Germany, Italy) have introduced gender quotas on corporate boards (Bertrand et al., 2018).====An explanation for the pervasive gender differences in educational choice and labour market outcomes can be found in (innate) differences between men and women in their willingness to compete (Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014, Kamas, Preston, 2018, Reuben, Wiswall, Zafar, 2017).==== A large body of experimental evidence indeed confirms that men are more competitive than women. In their seminal paper, Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) find that men opt more than twice as often as women for a competitive tournament as their preferred compensation scheme for a series of stylized, homogeneous tasks. Their experiment has been replicated many times (Azmat, Petrongolo, 2014, Niederle, Vesterlund, 2011). However, in the recent literature a more nuanced picture emerges, where one of the organizing principles seems to be that the gender differences in competitiveness depend on the nature of the task at hand.==== Men prefer competitive reward schemes more often than women for arithmetic, ball-tossing, and maze-solving tasks (Almås, Cappelen, Salvanes, Sørensen, Tungodden, 2015, Balafoutas, Sutter, 2012, Booth, Nolen, 2012, Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014, Healy, Pate, 2011, Niederle, Segal, Vesterlund, 2013, Saccardo, Pietrasz, Gneezy, 2017), while the gender gap is often not found, or sometimes even reversed, for verbal tasks (e.g. Dreber, von Essen, Ranehill, 2014, Große, Riener, Günther, Ekinci, Schwieren, Strobel, 2010, Shurchkov, 2012). In other words, men seem to compete more often in stereotypical male tasks, whereas women are at least equally competitive in stereotypical female tasks.====In this paper, we study the impact of two other task dimensions on the gender gap in reward scheme choices. First, we test whether the gender gap extends beyond the lab by looking at a real-life educational setting. The typical lab experiment involves relatively simple gaming tasks, such as completing a basic arithmetic problem, solving a maze, or tossing a ball in a bucket.==== It is not obvious that the finding from the lab — that men have a stronger preference for competitive reward schemes than women — can be replicated in the field with tasks that are familiar to the subjects and part of their daily lives. A growing body of research on confidence indicates that the familiarity with a task and the familiarity with the peers allow people to base their decisions on a more accurate prior of their relative standing in a group (Alicke, Klotz, Breitenbecher, Yurak, Vredenburg, 1995, Benoît, Dubra, 2011, Lavy, 2013, Perloff, Fetzer, 1986). In the lab, where tasks and competitors are unfamiliar, subjects may be overconfident. If this applies mainly to men, the gender gap in competitiveness is likely to be smaller in the field than in the lab.====Second, we examine whether the gender gap in competitiveness depends on the difficulty of the task at hand. As a large body of confidence research shows that task difficulty influences people’s perception of their own task performance and their relative performance in comparison to others in particular (Benoît, Dubra, Moore, 2015, Kruger, 1999, Moore, Cain, 2007, Windschitl, Kruger, Simms, 2003), task difficulty is likely to have an impact on the willingness to join a competition. Because self-assessments (How good am I?) have been shown to have a greater impact than other-assessments (How good are others?) (Kruger, 1999), people tend to overestimate their relative performance in easy tasks and underestimate their relative performance in difficult tasks (Hoelzl and Rustichini, 2005). We therefore expect that the preference for a competitive reward scheme diminishes in the difficulty of the underlying task.====However, men and women may not respond equally to variations in task difficulty. This follows from another group of confidence studies (Buser, 2016, Mobius, Niederle, Niehaus, Rosenblat, Roberts, Nolen-Hoeksema, 1989) suggesting that men and women differ in the extent to which they place weight on different self-assessment criteria. While men place more weight on their self-assessed performance in an ongoing task, women tend to be more conservative in their belief updating and rather rely on (external) assessments of their past performance in similar tasks. This leads to the prediction that men are more likely to overestimate their relative performance in an easy task and underestimate their performance in a difficult task, implying that the negative impact of an increase in task difficulty on the willingness to compete is stronger for men.====We provide evidence from three framed field experiments (Harrison and List, 2004), which we conducted during the final exams of a compulsory course in an undergraduate business and economics program between 2015 and 2017. In these experiments, we confronted students (in total 681) with a set of bonus questions and the choice to earn grade points for these questions either according to an absolute grading scheme, that is, the equivalent of a piece rate scheme, or according to a tournament scheme. To test the role of task difficulty, we varied the level of the bonus questions between treatments. In particular, in Experiment 1 (the 2015 cohort) we provided a set of relatively easy bonus questions. The difficulty of the questions was significantly increased in Experiment 2 (the 2016 cohort). Finally, in Experiment 3 (the 2017 cohort) we randomly allocated students from the same cohort to the easy and difficult questions.====Our findings largely confirm our hypotheses. Consistent with most of the literature on confidence, we find that the students are more likely to shy away from competition under the difficult-task treatments. Furthermore, in the easy-task treatments, men chose the tournament compensation scheme significantly more often than women. In contrast, in the difficult-task treatments the gender difference was small and insignificant. Hence, the result from the lab that men are more likely to opt for a competitive reward scheme has been replicated in our exam setting, but only under the condition that the task was relatively easy. Task difficulty significantly diminished the tournament-entry choices of everyone so that, on average, students were overconfident about their performance in the easy-task treatments: there is no evidence of overconfidence in the difficult-task treatments. Most importantly, men were more affected by the increased difficulty of the questions so that men and women appeared almost equally confident in the difficult-task treatments.====Our study contributes to the literature on gender differences in two important ways. First, it is one of a few experimental studies to explore gender differences in the willingness to compete in a real-life setting. There is a large body of evidence from the field that investigates a related hypothesis, namely that women perform worse than men under competitive pressures (Czibor, Onderstal, Sloof, Van Praag, De Paola, Gioia, Scoppa, 2015, Iriberri, Rey-Biel, 2019, Jurajda, Münich, 2011, Ors, Palomino, Peyrache, 2013, Pekkarinen, 2015).==== However, these studies focus on the gender gap in performance under competition rather than on the gender gap in the willingness to compete. Flory et al. (2014) and Samek (2019) are two noteworthy exceptions. They test for gender differences in the willingness to compete in a labor market setting and find that women are significantly less likely to apply for jobs with a more competitive compensation regime. In contrast, we test for gender differences in competitiveness in an exam setting.==== While the exam setting was also used by a number of field studies in the confidence literature (Bengtsson, Persson, Willenhag, 2005, Dahlbom, Jakobsson, Jakobsson, Kotsadam, 2011, Jakobsson, 2012, Nekby, Skogman Thoursie, Vahtrik, 2015), the focus of these studies is only on students’ confidence about their own performance and not on their confidence about their relative performance which is key to the concept of competitiveness.====A second contribution of our study is that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to investigate whether the gender gap in the willingness to compete depends on the difficulty of a task at hand. However, a small number of studies have examined related questions. In a series of experiments, Windschitl et al. (2003) investigated the moderating impact of task difficulty (shared adversities or shared benefits in their treatments) on subjects’ confidence about their relative task performance. Yet, their focus is on the self-assessed performance in an arranged competition. The impact of task difficulty on subjects' degree of confidence in their skill relative to others is the subject of the lab experiment by Hoelzl and Rustichini (2005), but the authors do not study gender differences. Finally, Gneezy et al. (2003) let the participants in one of their experiments choose the difficulty level from a menu of tasks and show that men prefer, on average, more difficult tasks in return for a higher piece-rate reward. Nevertheless, their findings do not imply that men more often than women prefer a more competitive environment when the difficulty of a task increases.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses our experimental design and Section presents 3 the results.

It also offers an unprecedented channel to collect data on how job seekers search for jobs and how firms search for employees. This paper discusses the research possibilities that this generates and reviews some of the recent developments in this area.","When individuals used to engage in formal job search, they would open the classified section of the newspaper and read the job advertisements posted there. The advertisements would feature some information about the jobs, and some way to contact the employer by phone or mail. For a labor market researcher, neither the newspaper nor the specific ads that the job seeker read are visible. Even the content of the ads was very difficult to collect. Whether a person would then get in touch with the employer was also not recorded and therefore hard to study. This way of searching for jobs had been in place for a long time, and researchers essentially took it as a given.====With the advent of high-speed internet and dedicated job search websites, this picture has drastically changed within a decade. While only 20% of U.S. unemployed workers searched for jobs online at the end of the 1990s, close to 80% did so a decade later. Fig. 1 replicated from Kuhn (2014) shows this, and highlights that this marks a trend that closely mimics the rollout of high-speed internet.====Nowadays, when individuals engage in formal job search, they access an online portal where they usually enter keywords and geographic area and get to see jobs that match their criteria. While early websites such as Craigslist.com were a close replica of classified sections in newspapers, in principle the flexibility of web-based platforms opens up completely novel ways of providing information and to organize what individuals can search for and how. This allows researchers not simply to observe the market outcomes, but potentially to act as designers of the market place, as I will elaborate below. Beyond the ability to change the market interaction, an interesting feature of the online search process is that it leaves a digital record of the search activities of individuals and of the job postings of firms.====The online environment thereby offers novelties in terms of the type of research that labor economists can now engage in which are summarized here, and I elaborate on them throughout this paper:====Online job search websites in general have access to a massive set of vacancies including the vacancy description and when and for how long the vacancy was advertised, which enables point (i). On the job seeker side they tend to track job seeker behavior summarized in (ii)–(v) above. Sometimes the websites even record whether firms get back to individuals through the portal, as indicated in (vi) above.====Records on (i)–(iv) are standard in most job search portals and already offer in unprecedented detail a view on the job search process on both sides of the market. Records on (v) are present for some websites, and (vi) is not yet common. If (v) and (vi) exist they often comprise only one of several ways that job seekers and firms can use to get in touch and therefore provide only a partial view. But as websites gain in sophistication and provide ever easier ways for both market sides to interact within the platform we are likely to see a more comprehensive view on these dimensions. And since some of these websites are run by the government or record official government identifiers, it is sometimes possible to (vii) link this data to administrative records of firms, workers, or even of matched worker-firm data.====Researchers are therefore now in a position to study in depth the process of job search, selection, and hiring. I expect that this will offer a revolution in our understanding of the hiring stage in labor markets, and this article reviews some of the recent advances on this below. Yet those only scratch the surface at this early point in this line of research. Given the wealth of papers in the macro-labor literature that have opened the black box of the matching function a little bit but lacked any observational data confirming their specifics assumptions, it seems that there is scope for a corrective wave of empirical research that will allow us to sharpen the models we use.====Returning to the theme of “search design” with which this article started, it is important to realize that the wealth of data that is now available plus the data that is available from administrative records might enable platforms and market designers to improve the market interaction. This is possible not only because of the new data, but because the arrival of online search engines enables (viii): the ability to optimize the search process and to customize/randomize information. Online platforms routinely explore improvements to their platforms by trying new designs on a subset of the market. They can do this as assigning information differentially to different users of the website is relatively easy, while it might have been difficult or impossible in the times where this information had to be printed in newspapers which were then available to everyone in the market. Labor economists could exploit this variation.====They can contribute to designing this variation by using insights from labor economics to guide them. This process of “search design” has at least three dimensions. First, one can design which additional information is provided to help job seekers. Given the general information overload that people are exposed to, a crucial choice is which type of additional information to provide. Examples that come to mind from a labor economics perspective are to display related occupations and jobs within them, or market tightnesses. Second, economists can aid in thinking through the fine details of the search process per se. Are keywords the best way to search? Should one allow other dimensions, such as search by market tightness? If so, which other dimensions should be “searchable”, and how would an algorithm trade them off.====Third, labor economists can also try to randomize other information within the market to better understand the workings of that market. Sending (fake) CV's randomly to employers has been in the repertoire of empirical economists for more than a decade to understand how employers would choose amongst potential employees. The online setting offers opportunities to do similar interventions easier and cheaper, and possibly for both sides of the market. This opens new opportunities to delve deeper into the workings of the labor market.====Both the study of novel observational data, and the ability to change the search process itself and to assess the outcome in a random fashion, have the potential to transform the way we understand and approach labor markets. The second part of changing the search process offers the additional exciting avenue for economists to become active in shaping the market interaction, rather than just acting as passive bystanders that take the search frictions as given. This is the key message of this paper.====In the remainder, I will use Section 2 to highlight some of the few existing papers that study novel observational data. The section will display the new possibilities for research that such data offers. Section 3 highlights a design approach to labor market search, and how to evaluate the success in a randomized design. It also reviews work on understanding the market through small randomized interventions in the market at large. Given that this work is just starting out, there is not a wealth of work to draw on yet. The section will be based on joint work with my co-authors Michele Belot and Paul Muller.

I analyze the friendship networks of a nationally representative sample of high-school students in the US. To address endogenous friendship formation, I adopt two distinct strategies: a selection correction approach and exploiting within-school cohort variations in parental compositions. I find that peers’ ==== and other observed characteristics, with a rich set of control variables and network ====, do not fully explain the ==== from peers’ parents of the same gender. Effects are more prominent for students with a disadvantaged background - less-educated parents, single-mother households, and less caring fathers. Suggestive evidence is provided to support the role model effect as a plausible channel.","Social interaction affects our beliefs and behaviors, constituting the ‘exposure effect’ in shaping child development. In the literature of economics, parents and peers have been identified as two indisputable sources. In the context of social network where individuals are directly or indirectly connected, peers’ parents can also affect the early-life experience of an individual. Compared to the vast literature on parental influence and peer effect, the relationship between peers’ parents and their social influences is relatively understudied.====The influence of peers’ parents can be non-negligible for a number of reasons. One mechanism is that children learn from their parents to behave in certain ways and affect their peers. Peers’ contemporaneous spillover such as academic performance, which is the primary focus of the peer effect literature, shall be considered a close counterpart of this channel. Parents are also the active actors behind school policies that benefit or harm the peers of their children (Walsh, 2008). Other possibilities involve direct interaction or the spread of information among social ties (Eble, Hu, 2019, Granovetter, 1973, Olivetti, Patacchini, Zenou, 2018). Whereas most of the attention in applied social network analysis is on the spillover among peers, this paper shows that the parent of one’s peer is another source of social influences.====To measure the influence of peers’ parents, I investigate the extent to which average college attainment of peers’ parents is related to a child’s future college attainment. I analyze the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) dataset which covers a nationally representative sample of high-school students in the US. In addition to standard demographic characteristics, the AddHealth dataset contains the detail of friendship networks in a school and the educational background of parents. The estimates from a baseline binary choice model reveal that the college attainment of peers’ parents does influence a child’s future college attainment. Moreover, the mechanisms are based on the gender of both peers’ parents and the child. Whereas the inclusion of peers’ observed characteristics (including academic performance), neighborhood characteristics, and network fixed effects negate the effect of peers’ parents of the opposite gender, the spillover from peers’ parents of the same gender remains robust. The magnitude of the same gender spillover is smaller compared to the influence of stronger social ties. For example, the spillover of peers’ paternal education on boys is one-third of the effect of having a father who is a college graduate, whereas the spillover of peers’ maternal education on girls is one-sixth of the effect of having a mother who is a college graduate.====To obtain a causal interpretation, an ideal setting is to randomly assign peers of different family background and observe their interaction with peers’ parents. However, in an observational study where friendships were formed naturally, one might worry that non-random sorting among students is a confounding factor. The inclusion of network fixed effects in the baseline model is not sufficient because there may still be within-school unobserved heterogeneity related to both the college outcome and friendship decision, which resembles the omitted variable bias. Therefore, I adopt two distinct approaches. The first strategy involves a selection-corrected model in the spirit of the Heckman two-step procedure (Heckman, 1976, Heckman, 1979, Hsieh, Lee, 2016). I simultaneously estimate network formation and college outcome equation, taking into account friendship sorting based on similarities in unobserved characteristics.==== This structural approach addresses a common type of friendship sorting called ‘homophily’. For example, smarter students tend to study together. However, there exist other types of formation process.==== To impose less assumptions on the friendship formation process, my second strategy follows a commonly used approach in the peer effect literature to exploit plausibly idiosyncratic variations in parental composition of each cohort (Bifulco, Fletcher, Ross, 2011, Hoxby, 2000, Olivetti, Patacchini, Zenou, 2018). This strategy regards all grade-mates as peers, as opposed to actual links, and makes use of quasi-random peer group formations. In both approaches, I do find a similar gender-specific pattern for students from a lower-educated family.====I arrive to the same conclusion as the recent finding by Fruehwirth and Gagete-Miranda (2019): the inclusion of peers’ academic performance, which is conventionally regarded as the ‘peer effect’, does not fully explain the spillover of peers’ parents.==== The gender-specific pattern further complicates the explanations behind the residual influence. Olivetti et al. (2018), who also analyze the AddHealth dataset, provided a clue. They find that the work decision of peers’ mothers generates as a role model effect and affects the future labor force participation of a girl. I therefore posit a similar logic about my current finding: there exists a role model effect from peers’ parents on human capital acquisition. There are several pieces of supporting evidence. First, the same-gender spillover is only significant when neither or only one of the parents graduated from college. Second, students whose father is absent also experience significant spillover from peers’ fathers.==== The estimate is particularly strong for girls. Third, the magnitude of the same gender spillover on males is stronger when one’s own father is less caring. Changing from having the least caring to the most caring father completely offsets the same gender spillover from peers’ fathers on males. As in the literature, young people look up to outside adult figures when they lack a role model inside family (Bisin, Verdier, 2001, Gustafson, Stattin, Magnusson, 1992). Last, I exploit the unique but under-utilized aspect of the AddHealth dataset – the ranking of friends. I find that the effect concentrates on the parents of close friends.====The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, I update the evidence on the importance of peers’ parental education. Manski (1993b) pioneers the distinction between contemporaneous spillover among peers and the effect of peers’ characteristics. The first refers to the ‘endogenous effect’ caused by peers’ outcome and the second refers to the ‘contextual’ effect generated by peers’ pre-existing characteristics.==== This paper is more related to contextual effects generated by the family background of peers. Among the studies using the AddHealth data, Bifulco et al. (2011) and Bifulco et al. (2014) analyze cohort composition of college educated mothers and find a small long-term effect on educational outcomes. More recently, Cools et al. (2019) define high-achievers using parental education (at least one parent with a degree). They find that the exposure to high-achieving boys has a negative effect on a girl’s educational attainment. Studies using other data sources also find a positive spillover from peers’ parents.==== Carrell and Hoekstra (2010) find that students suffering from domestic violence create negative spillover to the classroom. Black et al. (2013) analyze random variations of peer composition across cohorts in Norweigan schools and find significant effects of father’s earnings of grade-mates on male students. Studies in other countries also find that peers’ parents matter (Haraldsvik, Bonesrønning, 2014, McEwan, 2003).==== For example, Ammermueller and Pischke (2009) exploit random assignment of students into classes and find that the number of books in classmates’ homes is positively related to the reading test scores of 9- and 10-year-olds in six European countries. In China, Eble and Hu (2019) find that gender bias of classmates’ parents negatively affects the math score of a girl. This paper complements the studies on the effect of peers’ parental education in three aspects. First, I examine the friendship network. Methodologically, I estimate the spatial autoregressive model that allows students to have their own peer groups in a network (Bramoullé, Djebbari, Fortin, 2009, Lee, Liu, Lin, 2010, Lin, 2010). This is different from the linear-in-means model where a student is assumed to be affected by all members in a group (school, grade, or class) equally.==== Second, I differentiate the effects of peers’ fathers from that of peers’ mothers. Third, I relax the assumption that the effect of peers’ parents on educational outcomes is the same for male and female students.====The heterogeneous effect by gender further relates to two growing strands in economics. I provide evidence on when role modeling may take place. Earlier work has acknowledged that non-parental adults affect young people through demonstrating “know-how” of behaviors (Borjas, 1995, Wilson, 2012). Bisin and Verdier (2000) show that the influence of non-parental adults dominates parental influence when socialization within the family is not successful. Later evidence on role modeling typically refers to teachers (Bettinger, Long, 2005, Dee, 2007, Eble, Hu, 2017, Griffith, 2014) or senior peers (Kofoed, mcGoveny, 2019, Porter, Serra, 2019). With the angle of social network, peers’ parents can also demonstrate as role models either through direct interaction or the spread of information (Chung, 2000). My finding indicates that non-parental role models become more relevant when one’s family lacks a role model.====The gendered pattern also speaks to the significance of gender norm in driving economic decisions. Akerlof, Kranton, 2000, Akerlof, Kranton, 2002 pioneer the formulation of gender identity in an economic framework. In their setting, utility-maximizing individuals care about self-image. A cost is incurred if they deviate from the average behavior of the relevant gender group. Thus, the ‘ideal behavior’ creates a pressure to conform. Subsequent work also finds empirical ground about the importance of gender norms on economic behaviors (Alesina, Giuliano, Nunn, 2013, Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015, Fernandez, Fogli, 2009, Fernández, Fogli, Olivetti, 2004, Giménez-Nadal, Mangiavacchi, Piccoli, 2019). For example, Haaland et al. (2018) find that gender norm of a community disseminatesand affects the gender employment gap of the next generation. In my finding, with different educational compositions of fathers and mothers in a network, different beliefs on gender norm are passed down through inter-generation transmission.",Peers’ parents and educational attainment: The exposure effect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753712030018X,13 March 2020,2020,Research Article,306.0

We use a ==== which exploits the strong increase in the ERA between women born in 1951 and 1952. The analysis is based on the German ==== which includes about 370,000 households per year. We focus on heterogeneous labor market effects as well as spill-over effects within the household, and we study the distributional implications using net household income. In this respect, we extend the previous literature which mainly studies employment effects at the individual level. Our results show sizable labor market effects which strongly differ by subgroups. The income analysis suggests that the distribution of household income is not affected by the reform. Even for the most ","Aging populations challenge public pension systems. Therefore, most OECD countries have reversed their retirement policies since the 1990s and started to encourage longer working lives, thus alleviating the decline of the working age population. Reforms include tighter qualifying conditions and increases in the early retirement age (ERA), the introduction of actuarial deductions for early retirement, increases in the normal retirement age (NRA), i.e. the age at which people can first draw full benefits without actuarial deductions,==== increases in the statutory retirement age, or a combination of these policies.====A large empirical literature analyzes labor market effects of various pension reforms.==== Most of these studies use administrative social security data and exploit the quasi-experimental variation induced by pension reforms to estimate causal labor market effects. Administrative data have the advantage of providing accurate information about the working and earnings history of large samples or even the entire population. Yet, in general, social security data primarily include individual information and therefore, it is not possible to study effects of pension reforms at the household level. Consequently, with individual data it is not possible to analyze heterogeneous effects of pension reforms by household composition, or behavioral responses at the household level. The limitations for distributional and fiscal analyses are even more substantial. Based on individual data, distributional and fiscal analyses of pension reforms are only partially informative since other sources of income at the household level, most importantly the spousal income and household transfer income, cannot be considered.====In this paper, we focus on the household level in addition to the individual level. We quantify heterogeneous labor market effects, labor market effects at the household level as well as distributional and fiscal consequences induced by a substantial increase in the ERA. For the identification of these effects, we follow Geyer and Welteke (2019) and exploit exogenous variation of the 1999 pension reform in Germany, which abolished the ====. This reform meant that women born in 1951 could still retire early at age 60, whereas women born in 1952 would not be able to retire early until 63. The reform is especially interesting due to its intensity (three years increase) and immediateness (one cutoff and no step-wise implementation). Quasi-random assignment around the cutoff allows to credibly identify causal effects using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). We extend the study of Geyer and Welteke (2019), which focuses only on individual-level employment effects, in several important dimensions. First, we examine the role of the household context for labor market effects and second, we additionally quantify the distributional and fiscal effects of the pension reform. For our empirical analysis, we use repeated cross sections of the German microcensus, which is a survey covering about 1% of all German households on an annual basis.====In the first part of the empirical analysis, we use an RDD to evaluate the labor market effects. We focus on several different outcome variables, namely employment, retirement, unemployment, and inactivity. We quantify the average employment effect for the full population and focus on different subsamples to investigate effect heterogeneity of the pension reform. Moreover, we analyze the labor market effects at the household level. In the second part, we use the same empirical design and analyze the distributional implications of the pension reform, i.e. the effect on female income and on household income. Further, we quantify the fiscal effects.====As mentioned above, household information is in general missing in administrative data sets which are used in numerous analyses of pension reforms (examples are given in Footnote 2). At the same time, household surveys often include too few observations for an in-depth analysis of the household level. Therefore, only few studies focus on heterogeneous employment effects of pension reforms at the household level. Notable exceptions are the studies by Cribb et al. (2016) and Cribb and Emmerson (2018). They focus on the gradual increase in the ERA over several cohorts of women in the UK using the labor force survey. They find no significantly different employment effects by marital status, age of the partner, or housing wealth. Further, Cribb and Emmerson (2018) document negative income effects in particular for women in lower income households.====Our paper is also related to studies that focus on retirement behavior in the household context. For example Blau and Gilleskie (2006); Gustman and Steinmeier (2000); Michaud and Vermeulen (2011); van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008) estimate structural retirement models and show that complementarity in spouses’ leisure is a likely explanation for joint retirement behavior. Other studies use exogenous variation in pension age rules or incentives to identify joint retirement behavior in couples (e.g. Atalay, Barrett, Siminski, 2019, Banks, Blundell, Casanova, 2010, Lalive, Parrotta, 2017, Selin, 2017, Stancanelli, van Soest, 2012). The findings of this literature are mixed, yet most studies find larger spill-over effects for women than for men.====Finally, our study is linked to the growing literature that quantifies how economic shocks, such as unemployment or disability, can be reduced or partially insured in the household context, see e.g. Blundell et al. (2016), Autor et al. (2019) or Haan and Prowse (2015).====In line with Geyer and Welteke (2019), we find that raising the ERA leads on average to a sharp reduction in retirement, to positive employment effects, and to an increase in unemployment and inactivity. In addition, we document important heterogeneity in the labor market effects. Specifically, we find highly educated women and single women to have larger employment effects. Further our results show that responses at the household level are important. On the one hand we find support for joint-retirement behavior within couples, on the other hand the employment effects at the household level are in line with financial insurance effects within the household. The distributional analysis shows that while the distribution of individual income is affected by the reform, the distribution of household income is not affected. Even for the most vulnerable groups, such as single households or women without high education, we do not find significant reductions in household income. One reason for this result is program substitution. For women without high education we document a significant effect of the increase in the ERA on transfer receipt. Finally, we find sizable positive fiscal effects which are largely related to reduced pension payments to women aged 60-62.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the institutional context of the German public pension system and describes the 1999 pension reform. Thereafter, we describe the data and show descriptive statistics of the estimation sample. Section 4 explains the empirical methods and assumptions we use to identify the causal effect of an increase in the retirement age. Sections 5, 6, and 7 show the findings of our empirical analysis of labor market outcomes, income, and fiscal implications.

While cultural diversity might improve productivity through new ideas and innovation, linguistic diversity might increase communication costs and thereby reduce productivity. We apply a new measure of languages’ linguistic proximity to Norwegian linked employer-employee manufacturing data from 2003–12, and find that higher workforce linguistic diversity decreases productivity. We find a negative effect also when we control for the impact of cultural diversity. The detrimental impact disappears over time as immigrant workers’ expected proficiency in Norwegian improves since their time of arrival.","A key component in firms’ production strategies is to put together a workforce with the optimal mix of skills. Hiring workers with complementary human capital will improve productivity and profits. The ability to speak several languages and knowledge about cultures and religions could thus be important human capital resources influencing firm performance. Workers might differ along these dimensions too, and this could influence firm productivity (Lazear, 1999). Cultural diversity might introduce new ideas and innovation (Alesina et al., 2000; Kerr and Lincoln, 2010; Peri et al., 2015), since people with different backgrounds than the majority might see new solutions to problems. However, a firm with a workforce from several different cultures might have to spend resources to integrate the workers into well-functioning teams. For instance, cultural diversity implies preference heterogeneity that might create tensions and conflicts (Easterly and Levine, 1997) unless the firm has institutions to handle conflicts.====In this paper, we study the importance of the related costs and benefits of linguistic diversity on productivity. At the firm level, the flow of communication between co-workers will be slower if co-workers do not understand each other well, which can result in production problems and conflicts. Language differences can result in task differentiation, which might have negative effects on productivity if non-native language speakers do not have complementary skills. The potential costs are likely to increase with the distance between two languages. In contrast to cultural diversity, it is hard to think of positive effects of language diversity per se, except if the firm is exporting to a wide range of countries with different languages.====The empirical literature on the effects of linguistic diversity on productivity is surprisingly small (see Section 2). The paper most similar to ours is Parrotta et al. (2014). They use employer-employee data from Denmark to group the workforce into language groups (based on Ethnologue, 2009) and then calculate Herfindahl indexes to measure linguistic diversity. In their main OLS specifications, they find that a one standard deviation increase in diversity is associated with about 1.3% decrease in productivity, while the 2SLS estimates are twice this size.====We make four important contributions to the previous literature on how linguistic diversity affects productivity. First, we improve the measure of linguistic diversity. Instead of grouping together countries into language groups, we directly measure the linguistic proximity of languages using data of linguistic distances between 245 languages (Ginsburgh and Weber, 2016; Wichmann et al., 2018).==== Using this data set, we construct a measure of linguistic diversity within a firm's workforce based on Bossert et al. (2011) generalized index of fractionalization. Second, we employ a flexible production function, where we allow heterogeneous production technology and different labour immigrant-native skill groups, and even take into account fixed workplace effects. We simultaneously address different endogeneity issues using the standard approach in the firm productivity literature. Third, we address the issue of language learning and proficiency in a foreign universal language. Fourth, we attempt to separate the impact of linguistic diversity from the correlated impact of cultural diversity. We do so by employing data on cultural, religious and genetic differences between countries from the World Values Survey (WVS) and from Spolaore and Wacziarg (2016, 2018).==== These data allow us to construct measures of cultural, religious and genetic diversity of workplaces and we can then examine how sensitive the estimates for linguistic diversity are to controls for potentially confounding cultural diversities. Since Becker (1957), we know that both employer and co-worker discrimination might affect workplace productivity.==== While we cannot exclude the possibility that discrimination occur due to language preferences, discrimination can clearly also be attributed to genetic, religious and cultural differences. Since linguistic distance is positively correlated with genetic, religious and cultural distance (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2016), controls for genetic, religious and cultural distance are important also from a discrimination perspective.====In Section 2, we review the previous literature. Section 3 discusses how to measure linguistic diversity. Data and key measures are defined in Section 4. Section 5 presents the empirical approach. Section 6 studies the relationship between workplace linguistic diversity and the linguistic diversity of the lagged labour supply facing a workplace. Our main results are presented in Section 7, while Section 8 briefly concludes.",Linguistic diversity and workplace productivity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300191,7 March 2020,2020,Research Article,308.0

We use a longitudinal survey of children born in the UK in 2000–2001, the Millennium Cohort Study by the Centre for ====, to estimate the effect of family size on socio-emotional skills, measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. To account for the endogeneity of fertility decisions, we use a well-known instrumental approach that exploits parents’ preference for children’s gender diversity. We show that the birth of a third child negatively affects the socio-emotional skills of the first two children in a persistent manner. However, we show that this negative effect is entirely driven by girls. We provide evidence that this gender effect is partly driven by an unequal response of parents’ time investment in favour of boys and, to a lesser extent, by an unequal demand for household chores.","It is now broadly recognized that non-cognitive skills are key determinants of adult outcomes. Over the last 15 years, several studies have shown that they are as important as cognitive skills in determining a variety of outcomes, including educational attainment, labour market outcomes, crime rates, and health outcomes (Cobb-Clark, Tan, 2011, Conti, Heckman, Urzua, 2010, Fletcher, 2013, Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006, Lindqvist, Vestman, 2011, Nyhus, Pons, 2005). A recent study by Deming (2017) showed that the returns of non-cognitive skills in the labour market are even greater for newer cohorts.====Childhood is generally considered to be a critical period in the acquisition of non-cognitive skills. Due to complementarities across periods, high levels of skills early in childhood lead to greater productivity of investments later in childhood (Cunha and Heckman, 2007). While the literature has extensively explored the childhood determinants of cognitive skills, comparatively little is known about the determinants of the formation of non-cognitive skills. We already know that the latter are influenced by maternal time (Del Bono et al., 2016), parenting style (Fiorini and Keane, 2014), maternal education (Carneiro et al., 2013), and family income (Fletcher and Wolfe, 2016). Björklund and Jäntti (2012) and Grönqvist et al. (2017) found evidence supporting the existence of an intergenerational transmission of non-cognitive skills, while Black et al. (2017) showed that birth order predicts socio-emotional skills and occupational choices.====We complement these studies by asking whether family size influences the formation of children’s socio-emotional skills. The popular quantity–quality model (Becker, 1960, Becker, Lewis, 1973, Becker, Tomes, 1976) and resource-dilution theory are often used in the literature to explain the negative correlation between family size and individual’s outcomes (Björklund and Salvanes, 2011). However, the number of studies rejecting a quantity–quality trade-off regarding the formation of cognitive skills based on quasi-experimental variations is growing (Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010, Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010, Aslund, Grönqvist, 2010, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2010, Cáceras-Delpiano, 2006). Black et al. (2010) found a negative effect of an increase in family size instrumented by twin birth, while Aslund and Grönqvist (2010) found a small negative impact on children’s grades in compulsory and secondary school, but only for vulnerable children, as defined by low parental education, large sibships, and high birth order.====Here, we investigate whether an increase in family size has a negative impact on the accumulation of non-cognitive skills, as predicted by the Beckerian quantity–quality model and resource-dilution theory. The net effect of an increase in family size is ambiguous because we may also expect social interactions between siblings to affect the acquisition of non-cognitive skills. An extensive literature in psychology demonstrates that sibling relationships can, depending on the context, lead to either more aggressive behaviours (Slomkowski, Rende, Conger, Simons, Conger, 2001, Stauffacher, DeHart, 2006) or warmer attitudes that foster the development of social skills (Stormshak, Bellanti, Bierman, 1996, Volling, Belsky, 1992).====We empirically address this question by using a longitudinal dataset of children born in the UK in 2000–2001, namely the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the University of London, to study the effect of an increase in family size on the formation of socio-emotional skills. The main identification challenge is that fertility decisions are unlikely to be randomly distributed across families. Indeed, these decisions depend on both observable and unobservable family characteristics, such as parents’ socio-economic status, their life satisfaction, their own non-cognitive skills, and their parenting style, that are likely to be correlated with the formation of socio-emotional skills during childhood. To account for the endogeneity of fertility decisions, we use a well-known instrumental approach developed by Angrist and Evans (1998), which exploits the fact that parents whose first two children are of the same sex are more likely to have an additional child than parents whose children are of opposite sex. Contrary to most of the studies using this instrumental approach, we are able to follow children over time and observe how they behave ==== and ==== an increase in family size. The richness of this cohort study data enables us to confirm that there are no pre-existing differences between children from families whose first two children are of the same sex and children from families whose first two children are of opposite sex. Finally, we provide evidence that there is no parental preference for one gender as regards fertility decisions in our data.====Using the parental preferences for child sex variety as a natural source of variation in fertility decisions, we show that the birth of a third child negatively affects the formation of socio-emotional skills for both the first- and the second-born. In particular, we find that this effect is stronger if the birth occurs when the children are young (under six years old). More surprisingly, we find no effect of the birth of a third child for boys: The negative effect of the birth of a third child is entirely driven by girls. Investigating the potential mechanisms at play, we provide evidence that this differential effect across gender is partly driven by an unequal response of parents’ time investment in favour of boys and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the demand for household chores for girls. We also show that the negative effects of family size persist even 11 years after the event.====To the best of our knowledge, only two previous studies are similar to ours. Using different methods and, respectively, UK and US data, Silles (2010) and Juhn et al. (2015) found negative associations between family size and the development of non-cognitive skills of children, as measured by the British Social Adjustment Guide and the Rutter B scale in the former, and by the National Longitudinal Study of Youth’s Behavior Problem Index in the latter. Our paper contributes to the literature in several key aspects. First, we make use of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a well-established measure in psychology, to study the impact of an increase in family size not only on behavioural and emotional skills but also on pro-social behaviour. As shown in Layard et al. (2014) and Clark and Lepinteur (2019), behavioural and emotional skills have different influences on future adult outcomes (e.g., unemployment experience, educational attainment, well-being). Second, we use an instrumental variables approach to estimate the causal impact of family size on the different dimensions of the SDQ and provide a thorough examination of the potential sources of heterogeneity and channels. More specifically, we are the first to show that there is a family-size penalty for girls regarding the development of behavioural, emotional and pro-social skills. We explain this penalty by exploring channels already investigated in Juhn et al. (2015), that is, parental investment, but we also provide evidence of a new channel: As family size increases, girls tend to be more likely than boys to perform household chores. Silles (2010) and Juhn et al. (2015), respectively, rely on generations born in 1958 and at the end of the 1980s. We provide evidence for a much younger cohort, the MCS cohort, born in 2000–2001, for whom the acquisition of non-cognitive skills is of higher importance than previous generations (Deming, 2017).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and the main measure of socio-emotional skills exploited in this paper. Section 3 presents our instrumental approach and provides evidence on the validity of the identifying assumption.

The results demonstrate that child schooling is pro-cyclical in Turkey, with the most acute effects among children with less educated parents and living in rural areas. Finally, as hypothesized, we find asymmetric effects on child schooling based on skill composition of employment growth–higher unemployment among unskilled workers increases schooling, whereas higher unemployment among skilled workers decreases schooling.","Human capital investment decisions are expected to be independent of transitory employment and income shocks. Despite this prediction, a growing body of research suggests that schooling decisions are often affected by immediate economic factors, particularly by the changes in the labor market conditions. The sensitivity of educational investments to economic cycles is more important in developing countries where economic downturns are more frequent and acute, and households are more vulnerable due to weaker safety nets and imperfectly-functioning financial markets. However, empirical evidence of the cyclicality of schooling in the context of developing countries is sparse and, among the few existing papers, the findings are inconclusive and subject to a number of concerns related to the endogeneity of macroeconomic conditions.====In this paper, we study the effects of macroeconomic shocks on child schooling in Turkey, a country that has experienced highly-volatile macroeconomic cycles and marked variation in cycles across regions. Using a representative, household-level dataset to identify the impact of local labor conditions, we exploit exogenous variation in local labor demand that is driven by both national industry-specific employment growth rates and the baseline industry-level employment composition across regions. The paper also investigates the role of labor market conditions according to the unskilled (e.g., agriculture) and skilled (e.g., high-tech manufacturing) labor demand. We posit that employment growth biased toward unskilled labor, such as primary commodities and unskilled manufacturing, is expected to increase demand for unskilled workers, thereby increasing the opportunity cost of schooling and reducing education.==== On the other hand, employment growth biased toward skilled labor is expected to increase demand for skilled workers, thereby increasing the returns to schooling and increasing education. This suggests that the skill composition of labor demand plays an important role in the effect of labor market conditions on schooling, but previous studies have abstracted from this distinction, particularly studies focusing on developing countries.====This is the first paper to explore the role of macroeconomic conditions in child schooling in Turkey, which has several characteristics that make it an interesting case study. Turkey has relatively low levels of education for an upper-middle-income country. The average years of total schooling is 7.1 years among the adult population, where 4 percent of the adult male population and 15 percent of the adult female population has no schooling (Barro and Lee, 2013). In addition, macroeconomic conditions and employment growth, in particular, have been highly volatile, and consequently, unemployment rates have varied widely over the 2005 to 2013 period. Finally, employment growth has been highly biased towards unskilled-labor-intensive sectors. For example, the share of unemployed workers with tertiary education in overall unemployment has increased from 11 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in 2013, with variation across regions ranging from 6 to 29 percent in 2013.====The direction of the effect of macroeconomic shocks on child schooling is ambiguous, especially in the context of a developing country. On the one hand, economic downturns and poor labor market conditions reduce the opportunity cost of schooling, generating a substitution effect that is expected to increase education (counter-cyclical). On the other hand, economic downturns might reduce household income, thereby reducing child schooling whenever education is a normal good (pro-cyclical). When credit markets are well-functioning, transitory economic shocks should generate only modest income effects on schooling, as schooling decisions are long-term decisions and hence subject to lifetime earnings. However, in the context of developing countries, households might face financial constraints, and adverse economic shocks might significantly reduce their ability to pay for schooling. Economic downturns that increase skilled unemployment, in particular, may reduce the expected returns to education, thereby reducing the incentive to invest in schooling. The ambiguity of net effect on schooling suggests that the question is empirical in nature, and that country-wide empirical investigations are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms.====More importantly, investigating skill-structure of employment growth entails important policy implications as policymakers often promote expansions in education as well export-led growth in sectors that are often intensive in unskilled labor. This paper demonstrates that, to the extent that education is important in long-run growth, these two policies might be at odds with promoting economic development. Finally, because the findings in the literature are mixed, dividing the effects according to the skill composition of employment growth might serve to reconcile the findings of the literature.====This paper uses data from the Turkish Household Labor Force Survey spanning 2004 to 2013. The dataset is a nationally-representative sample of the Turkish population that includes detailed information on labor market activity of adult individuals, such as labor force participation and occupation by economic sector, as well as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The primary measure of local labor market conditions is unemployment rates, which we construct at the sub-regional level. Because local labor market conditions reflect both the demand for and supply of labor, we construct a labor demand index based on variation in national industry-specific growth rates and baseline industry employment shares across regions (Bartik, 1991, Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005, Blanchard, Katz, 1992).==== Using the labor demand index as an instrumental variable, we estimate the effect of local labor market conditions on school attendance of children aged 6 to 14, controlling for sub-region and year fixed effects, as well as household and child covariates.====The results indicate that child schooling is pro-cyclical: a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate reduces the probability of child school attendance by 5 percentage points, which corresponds to a 5% reduction relative to the mean. Consistent with our predictions, we find that higher unskilled unemployment rates increase schooling, whereas higher skilled unemployment rates decrease schooling, which highlights the import role of distinguishing between the skilled and unskilled labor demand in understanding the role of macroeconomic conditions in child schooling.====In addition, consistent with the hypothesis that credit-constrained households would be more adversely impacted by negative economic shocks, we find that the results are more acute among children with less-educated parents and living in rural areas. To shed light on a potential mechanism, we demonstrate that parental labor force participation plays an important role in the extent to which macroeconomic shocks affect schooling outcomes. We further study the long-run effects of labor market conditions and find suggestive evidence that the effects of macroeconomic conditions are persistent and not transitory as higher regional unemployment rates during childhood has adverse effects on long-run education and employment outcomes of young adults. The results withstand various robustness checks, including using employment-to-population ratios as an alternative to the unemployment rate, employing various alternative measures of the instrumental variable, including using alternative base years and the exclusion of spillover effects, and controlling for various covariates, such as lagged unemployment rates and birth order.",Macroeconomic conditions and child schooling in Turkey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120300154,6 March 2020,2020,Research Article,310.0

We argue in this paper that this finding is mainly due to volatility in working time. Using a non-parametric approach, we find from French data that changes in labor earnings exhibit strong asymmetry and high peakedness. However, after decomposing labor earnings growth into growth in wages and working time, deviations from Gaussianity stem from changes in working time. The nonlinearity of earnings dynamics is also mostly driven by working time dynamics at the extensive margin.","The canonical model of earnings assumes log-normal shocks and linear dynamics, although both assumptions have been challenged based on the data. Relaxing these assumptions matters for at least three reasons. First, deviations of labor earnings shocks from log-normality lead to the overestimation of upward earnings mobility. Models based on normal processes are known to overestimate the probability of an individual with low earnings having high earnings in the future (Horowitz, Markatou, 1996, Lillard, Willis, 1978). Hence, a diagnosis of labor market inequalities along the lifecycle based on Gaussianity assumptions suffers from excessive optimism that is likely to be detrimental to the workers in question, who are possibly trapped at the bottom of the distribution. Second, knowledge about the distributional properties of hourly wage growth and earnings is crucial for quantifying precautionary savings and labor supply (Jessen et al., 2018) and other reactions to fluctuations as a first step. Third, welfare costs associated with fluctuations in labor earnings (quantified for instance by Pijoan-Mas, 2006, under incomplete markets) are likely to be underestimated under log-normality on wage growth combined with linearity assumptions on earnings dynamics. In addition to deviations from Gaussianity, nonlinear dynamics of labor income have a first-order impact on consumption and saving behavior; a better understanding of income processes helps fill the gap between income and consumption inequalities. Taking both the nonlinearity and the non-Gaussianity of income dynamics into account is therefore essential when designing optimal social insurance and direct taxation. Arellano et al. (2017) show, for instance, that nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity generate heterogeneous consumption responses and that assuming linearity instead is misleading when assessing the impact of earnings shocks. Large, negative income shocks are responsible for relatively small consumption drops at the bottom of the distribution but have sizable effects at the top. By contrast, large, positive shocks seem more profitable in the short run at the bottom of the distribution, but this effect vanishes in the long run. Under the canonical model, the effect of earnings shocks on consumption is assumed to be homogeneous regardless of the location in the distribution.====This paper investigates the channels through which deviations from normality and nonlinear dynamics occur by relying on an accounting decomposition of labor earnings into hourly wages and working time at both the extensive and intensive margins; the infra-annual extensive margin upon which we focus in this paper refers to participation in the labor market, captured by the annual number of days worked, while the intensive margin designates the daily number of hours worked, i.e., the annual number of hours worked divided by the annual number of workdays. We build in particular on recent works (Guvenen et al., 2016) that quantify the importance of deviations from Gaussianity. We adopt an agnostic perspective on French labor earnings data and characterize the distribution of earnings changes conditional on recent earnings history. The novelty of our approach consists in decomposing earnings into several components (wage, days worked, number of hours worked per day) thanks to available information on working time. When assessing the importance of the deviation from log-normality, we are able to disentangle what is due to hourly wages from what is related to working time at both margins. We rely on the DADS (====) panel, a longitudinal administrative database, the completion of which is mandatory for payroll taxes and that contains information on individuals’ labor earnings. We focus on men working in the private sector from 1995 to 2015. As in the US, we find that log-earnings changes are not Gaussian, that their distribution is leptokurtic and negatively skewed, and that individual labor earnings dynamics are both nonlinear and heterogeneous. More precisely, we find that (i) large labor earnings changes that drive the negative skewness and the fat tail are primarily working time changes, especially at the extensive margin; (ii) although we reject the log-normality assumption in the data for wage growth, this deviation from Gaussianity is much smaller than it is for working time; (iii) much of the nonlinearity==== and heterogeneity==== in earnings dynamics is driven by working time dynamics at the extensive margin; and (iv) finally, the choice between moment-based and quantile-based measures of higher-order moments of the distribution of changes in labor outcomes matters, which stresses the role played by methodological issues.====Overall, deviations from normality are primarily the result of unemployment risk: it follows that the welfare cost of non-Gaussian earnings fluctuations depends mainly on the level of insurance provided by unemployment benefits. This work sheds light on the relative importance of the extensive margin, and this empirical finding has two implications. First, for policy makers, the appropriate solutions to labor market inequalities are highly dependent on the relative importance of each channel. It turns out that in France, the extensive margin plays a larger role, which calls for a careful examination of the design of the unemployment insurance scheme.==== Most of the recent policy debate has focused on enhancing both flexibility and security: on the one hand, by improving coverage after layoffs and by providing workers with unemployment insurance; on the other hand, by lowering labor costs, either thanks to social contribution exemptions at the bottom of the distribution or by diminishing firing costs and capping the maximal amount granted by labor courts to workers in case of disputes. Second, in the same vein but from a more academic perspective, addressing the problem of ”zeroes”, i.e., career gaps or incomplete labor market sequences, is a first-order issue; although this topic is relatively well known, few papers take this concern seriously (see for instance Biewen, Fitzenberger, de Lazzer, 2018, Magnac, Roux, 2009). Censored models, microsimulation and supplementary data (e.g. on non-labor earned income) would definitely be needed to further pursue this topic.====Numerous papers in the literature are devoted to earnings dynamics model volatility while relying on parametric assumptions: Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2002, Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2011, Baker and Solon (2003), Low et al. (2010), Altonji et al. (2013) as well as Magnac et al. (2018). Most papers assume Gaussian shocks, although Lillard and Willis (1978) noted that “the actual distribution of log earnings is leptokurtic and slightly negatively skewed with respect to [the corresponding normal distribution]” and Horowitz and Markatou (1996) further argued that in such models, the transitory error component exhibits fatter tails than a normal distribution and that misspecification, including Gaussian shocks, could overestimate the probability of upward earnings mobility. Other papers consider mixtures of normals, including Geweke and Keane (2000) and Bonhomme and Robin (2009).====Recent works have suggested an agnostic, non-parametric perspective on log-earnings changes in the data to document the validity of parametric assumptions used by researchers when estimating dynamic models of earnings. Using individual-level earnings data, namely, W-2 forms==== obtained from the US Social Security Administration (SSA) over the 1978-2011 period, Guvenen et al. (2016) documented first that labor earnings ==== are not log-normal. In another contemporaneous project,  Busch et al. (2018) propose decomposing labor earnings into the product of hourly wages and annual hours worked. However, there is a methodological issue related to the measure of higher-order moments of the distribution of shocks. Based on Italian data,  Hoffmann and Malacrino (2019) use ==== measures of dispersion, asymmetry and heaviness of tails. They show that both the negative skewness of annual labor earnings growth and its fluctuations over the business cycle are driven by employment time changes, i.e., changes in the number of weeks an individual works during a year. The distribution of weekly earnings growth is instead symmetric and stable over the business cycle. By contrast, Busch et al. (2018a) resort to ==== measures to characterize the distribution of hourly wage shocks in German data, and they find that Kelley’s skewness is negative, therefore concluding that hourly wage changes in the country exhibit an asymmetric distribution.====Finally, a vast strand of literature relates labor earnings changes to consumption and saving behavior: see, e.g., Blundell and Preston (1998), Parker and Preston (2005), Blundell et al. (2008) as well as Pistolesi (2014) who focus on income and consumption inequalities. Under tight borrowing constraints, higher volatility of labor income might prevent individuals from smoothing their consumption; incomplete markets combined with inequality may result in inefficiency. In such situations, precautionary motives arise as a way for agents to insure themselves against earnings fluctuations, either by saving more (precautionary saving) or by working longer hours (precautionary labor supply). According to Pijoan-Mas (2006), the relative importance of the two motives depends on the persistence of the non-deterministic component of the wage process,==== and the inability of markets to insure against fluctuations could be responsible for large welfare losses. According to Jessen et al. (2018), precautionary labor supply would amount to 2.8% of hours worked in Germany.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to a brief description of the institutional setting that prevails in the French labor market. Section 3 presents our data. In Section 4, we describe our empirical approach to disentangle wages from working time changes in labor earnings growth.

We exploit the state and temporal variation in the issuing of state driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants to estimate their impact on labor market outcomes. Using 2005 through 2017 data from the American Community Survey, we show that likely undocumented men increase their weekly hours of work in response to the availability of driver's licenses. Perhaps due to their already high labor force participation, the impact is somewhat moderate. We also find no similar impacts among similarly skilled foreign-born Hispanic men who have naturalized. The policy slightly raises commuting time, suggesting changes in work patterns, as well as likely undocumented immigrants’ propensity to have an occupation that requires driving. At a time when anti-immigrant sentiments are at an all-time high, understanding how these policies impact targeted groups and similarly skilled citizens is crucial for maintaining an informed immigration policy debate.","Undocumented immigrants make up 3.5% of the U.S. population, and 5.1 percent of its labor force (Krogstad and Passel, 2015). Yet, their labor supply, assimilation and ability to contribute to the U.S. economy is likely to depend on their ability to drive. Spatially decentralized urban and suburban areas make the United States one of the top motor-vehicle dependent countries in the world.==== For many low-skilled workers living further away from high-density job areas having access to a car is a necessity to get to work (Raphael and Rice, 2002). We examine how states’ granting of driving privileges to undocumented migrants may impact their employment and wages.====Several states have recently enacted measures granting undocumented immigrants access to driver's licenses. Access to a driver's license can significantly lower the commuting costs of many undocumented immigrants by reducing their probability of being charged with driving without a license during a police stop. Such a charge can result in getting their car impounded, fines, potential loss of earnings if unable to get to work, not to mention required court appearances that can lead to deportation.==== Whereas undocumented immigrants have been shown to be more risk tolerant than documented immigrants (Dustmann ====., 2017), many fear the higher risk of apprehension and deportation in the current immigration enforcement environment. In this regard, fifty percent of undocumented migrants who return to Mexico in the ==== (EMIF) report fearing deportation while residing in U.S. states adopting immigration enforcement measures (Amuedo-Dorantes ====., 2013). Media reports have documented how children are left alone when their parents are taken into custody by immigration authorities after being stopped by the police and charged with driving without a license.==== Indeed, traffic violations are among the top reasons for being detained.==== In contrast, undocumented migrants with a valid driver's license may be allowed to drive away after a traffic stop after providing proof of identity and eligibility to drive.==== As such, a standard labor supply model would predict that, by lowering the risk associated with driving to work, access to a driver's license can lower commuting costs, raise the expected return from working and increase labor supply.====Using 2005 through 2017 data from the American Community Survey, we exploit the state and temporal variation in the granting of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants to estimate its impact on this population's employment likelihood, weekly hours of work and real hourly wages. We find that likely undocumented men increase their labor supply in response to the availability of driver's licenses, although modestly. Specifically, likely undocumented men raise their weekly work hours by 1.6%. These findings hold after taking into account the possible endogenous adoption of a state policy granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and the non-random residential choices made by undocumented immigrants. They are also unique to our sample of likely undocumented men, as similarly skilled, foreign-born, Hispanic, long-term resident, naturalized counterparts do not exhibit a significant response to the policy.====We also investigate the mechanisms through which the policy impacts are likely to take place by exploring changes in likely undocumented migrants’ work commuting patterns. Even in states that do not grant unauthorized migrants driver's licenses, 78% of likely undocumented immigrant men in our sample indicate using a motor vehicle to get to work, and only 29% of them carpool. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that their work commuting options remain largely unchanged by states’ granting of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. However, their daily one-way work commuting time slightly rises by 3%. We also find evidence of access to driver's licenses increasing the propensity of having a job that requires driving, such as driving a bus or taxi, by 25%.====Our paper contributes to a growing body of work examining the impact of a variety of recently adopted tougher interior enforcement measures on undocumented immigrants and their families (==== Bohn ==== 2014; Miles and Cox, 2014; Amuedo-Dorantes ==== 2018; Kostandini ==== 2013; Watson, 2014). To this date, analyses of undocumented immigrants’ employment outcomes have been primarily focused on the impact of tougher interior immigration enforcement measures, such as employment verification mandates (==== Amuedo-Dorantes and Bansak, 2012; Bohn and Lofstrom, 2013; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2015). Compared to previous studies, which focused on measures challenging the assimilation of undocumented migrants, we look at a policy measure that should facilitate the assimilation of undocumented migrants by allowing them to drive more safely with proper identification and proof of eligibility to drive.

We answer this question by testing whether unemployment insurance alters the job finding rate differentially across the wage distribution. To do this, we use a Mixed Proportional Hazard Competing Risk Model in which we classify quantiles of the wage distribution as competing risks faced by searching unemployed workers. Allowing for flexible unobserved heterogeneity across spells, we find that unemployment insurance increases the likelihood that a searcher matches to higher paying jobs relative to low or medium paying jobs, rejecting the notion that wage offers and job arrival rates are independent. We show that dependence between wages and job offer arrival rates explains 9% of the increase in the duration of unemployment associated with unemployment insurance.","It is well established that an increase in unemployment insurance (UI) increases unemployment duration.==== Two primary channels have been put forward to understand the connection between UI and unemployment duration. First, UI extensions may decrease a worker’s overall search effort and therefore increases the time spent unemployed. Second, UI may increase the worker’s reservation wage and therefore increase their duration of unemployment as the worker turns down low wage jobs.==== In this paper we investigate how a change in a worker’s search effort affects his unemployment duration by asking: is the arrival rate of a job offer independent from the wage it pays?====If the job arrival rate is independent of the wage offer, as with search models in the spirit of Pissarides (2000), then UI affects a worker’s overall job finding rate changing their search intensity and changing the set of acceptable wage offers. On the other hand, if UI affects a worker’s search behavior and their likelihood of finding high wage jobs relative to low or medium wage jobs (as with search models in the spirit of Moen (1997)), then the effect of UI is more subtle. To test for such a relationship between job arrival rates and wages, we ask whether the semi-elasticity of the hazard rate with respect to UI receipt is constant across the wage distribution. We formally test this assumption using a mixed proportional hazards competing risks (MPHCR) model, with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). We find that the semi-elasticity of the hazard with respect to UI is not constant across the wage distribution, suggesting that the arrival rate of a job offer depends on the wage that it pays. We then decompose the increase in unemployment duration caused by UI and find that the correlation between arrival rates and wages accounts for about 9% of the increase in the duration of unemployment.====Our paper contributes to the empirical literature testing the effect of UI on unemployment duration as well as re-employment wages. With respect to unemployment duration we find positive effects of similar magnitude to recent research using administrative data from Europe (for example Schmieder et al. (2012)). The empirical literature on wage effects is mixed: Lalive (2007), Schmieder et al. (2016) and Card et al. (2007) find small negative effects of UI on subsequent wages while others such as Black et al. (2003) and Nekoei and Weber (2017) find positive effects.==== We find that UI has positive wage effects for individuals who receive UI, although they experience longer average durations of unemployment. While most recent papers take a reduced form approach, which allows these papers to test the effect of UI on unemployment duration and the resulting wage, our approach accounts for durations and wages jointly, allowing us to analyze how UI affects search behavior and job finding rates across the wage distribution.====The paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we formally outline the framework we use to test the independence of job arrival rates and wage offers. In Section 3 we discuss the data and issues of selection. In Section 4 we derive the likelihood function and the empirical test of the effect of UI on the hazard rate of leaving unemployment. In Section 5 we discuss the results and the robustness of the results.

For this we use merged population-wide registers on health and economic and ,"A currently expanding literature examines how up- and downturns of the economy affect the health of newborn children. This research is motivated by evidence that health at birth impacts both health and labour market outcomes later in life (Currie, 2009) and that relatively mild shocks in utero can have substantive adverse effects on the individual in the long run (the so-called fetal origins hypothesis, for reviews see Almond, Currie, 2011, Almond, Currie, Duque, 2018). Understanding the impact of economic conditions on newborn health as well as the underlying mechanisms is therefore important in order to realize efficiency gains through reallocation of resources to early-life periods. It also contributes to accurately estimating the cost of the business cycle and determining the need for stabilization policies (see Barlevy, Barlevy, for a review). In addition, to gauge the effectiveness of health-improving interventions after the first year of life, it is useful to improve our understanding of the determinants of early-life health.====Previous work for developing countries has found strong evidence that recessions tend to increase infant mortality, while booms tend to lower it.==== In contrast with this evidence, it has been suggested that the effect of the cycle differs in developed countries, with newborn health improving in recessions. The pivotal study by Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004), using U.S. state-level data, estimates that an increase in the unemployment rate by one percentage point lowers both the infant mortality rate and the incidence of very low birth weight (below 1500 grams) by 0.5%.====There are several reasons for why babies’ health suffers less from recessions in developed countries than in developing countries (see also the discussion in Ferreira and Schady, 2009). First, while spending on public health care has been shown to decline during downturns in developing countries (Cutler, Knaul, Lozano, Méndez, Zurita, 2002, Paxson, Schady, 2005), fiscal policy generally tends to be countercyclical rather than procyclical in developed countries (Lane, 2003). Second, recessions are often shorter in developed countries, and given the higher level of health spending, marginal reductions are less severe. Third, credit markets are more widespread, allowing mothers to smooth income and thus spending on health care and nutrition.====Studies on effects of economic fluctuations in developed countries on health of the ==== population confirm that contemporaneous health improves in recessions. Pioneering work by Ruhm (2000) and many subsequent studies provide strong evidence for the procyclicality of the total mortality rate.==== Several of the channels linking the business cycle to adult health also apply to babies, both in utero and shortly after birth.==== This includes channels that are related to parental job loss, since downturns give rise to displacements and lower chances of re-employment. Job loss reduces the available income that can be spent on tobacco and alcohol. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy are highly detrimental to newborns’ health. It has been shown that these behaviors are less prevalent in downturns (Ruhm, 2000, Ruhm, Black, 2002). Further, as a result of job loss, the mother’s opportunity cost of time decreases, so she may become more engaged in time-intensive activities that benefit babies’ health, such as prenatal care, physical exercise or breast-feeding (Miller and Urdinola, 2010), and her exposure to hazardous working conditions decreases. One may also consider channels that are not propelled through actual job loss. First, recessions are associated with less traffic and lower air pollution levels (Chay and Greenstone, 2003). Air pollution, in turn, has been shown to be an important determinant of newborn health (see Currie, Zivin, Mullins, Neidell, 2014, Currie, Zivin, Mullins, Neidell, 2014, for a review of the literature). Second, while job loss has been associated with stress, lower workloads in recessions might reduce job-related stress for those who do not lose their job, and positive spillovers among parents are likely. There is plenty of evidence that stress affects birth outcomes, in particular during the first trimester of pregnancy (Bozzoli, Quintana-Domeque, 2014, Camacho, 2008, Foureaux Koppensteiner, Manacorda, 2016, Lee, Orsini, 2018, Mansour, Rees, 2012, Torche, 2011). Third, economic upturns might be characterized by a shortage of medical staff, resulting in lower availability and quality of prenatal and neonatal care (Stevens et al., 2015). The latter mechanism, however, could also work in the opposite direction if the enlarged tax revenues brought about by upturns are used to increase the quantity and quality of medical staff (Konetzka et al., 2018).====In the light of the importance of the issues at hand, it is perhaps surprising that there is only little evidence for developed countries. Margerison-Zilko (2010) does an extensive literature search and finds about 15 studies, almost all of which concern aggregate data. One major complication in estimating the effect of the cycle is that women who give birth in a recession may systematically differ from those who give birth in a boom. Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) argue that low-educated women – who do not suffer from skill depreciation – prefer to give birth in recessions when the wage they would receive is low. The authors provide evidence that the fraction of low-educated mothers indeed rises in times of high unemployment, at least for white mothers. The effect is reversed for black mothers, a finding that Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) attribute to credit constraints. In this line of reasoning, low-educated black mothers would also prefer to give birth in recessions, but cannot afford to do so since credit constraints prevent them from smoothing income over time. Salvanes (2013) and Aparicio and González (2014) find that low-educated mothers are overrepresented in recessions.====The composition of newborns has also been studied in the literature on long-run health effects of conditions at birth. After all, late-life health problems among cohorts exposed to adverse early-life conditions may be affected by selective fertility in the corresponding birth years. Most of these studies do focus on what are now developed countries; however, the birth cohorts are from years in which governmental social safety nets were largely absent. Some studies examine how exposure relates to birth rates or to the composition of newborns in terms of observed characteristics of the families into which they are born, following the line of reasoning that if such a relation exists then it is also more likely that there are systematic differences between exposed and non-exposed in terms of unobserved characteristics of the families. Van den Berg and Modin (2013) provide an overview of those studies (see e.g. Kåreholt, 2001, van den Berg, Lindeboom, López, 2009, van den Berg, Doblhammer-Reiter, Christensen, 2011). They all conclude that the composition of newborns does not vary systematically over the business cycle.====One approach to deal with compositional changes over the business cycle is to compare babies born to the same mother at different stages of the cycle. Econometrically, this may be achieved by including mother fixed effects in the model equations, which requires individual-level data. Interestingly, when Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004), who study the U.S., control for mother fixed effects using a subsample from California, the positive effects on the health of newborns become all insignificant, suggesting that selection had been the main driver. Other studies of developed countries employing fixed-effects identification strategies also fail to establish a significant relationship with the cycle (Salvanes, 2013, Salvanes, 2013, for Norway and Aparicio and González, 2014, for Spain).==== Most studies of developing countries find their results unaltered when accounting for selection bias (Baird, Friedman, Schady, 2011, Bhalotra, 2010, Paxson, Schady, 2005).====Van den Berg and Modin (2013) consider individual records from Swedish birth cohorts 1915–1929, where birth weight was recorded at birth by health care workers. Note that at that time, Sweden was not yet a developed economy according to today’s standards. They find no relationship between the national business cycle and birth weight, both in basic analyses and in fixed-effects analyses with mother-specific fixed effects. Van den Berg et al. (2017b) use family-specific fixed-effects in the analysis of long-run effects of conditions at birth among Dutch birth cohorts around 1850 on individual longevity, and they subsequently examine the distribution of the estimated unobserved family-specific fixed effects over the various birth years. They find no evidence of an association between conditions around birth on the one hand, and the unobserved family-specific “frailty” determinant of longevity on the other hand.====This paper contributes to existing literature in several important ways. First, we shed new light on the relationship between economic conditions and newborn health in developed countries using data from Sweden. The data come from population-wide registers spanning the years 1992 to 2004; they include comprehensive information of infant health and conditions around birth, from the neonatal and patient registers. All information is recorded at the individual level and in real time by professional health care workers. We match these data with monthly local-labour-market unemployment rates which provide indicators of the business cycle. Exploiting geographical variation in unemployment within Sweden, we control for variables that may confound a relation between economic conditions and newborns’ health.====Second, we improve upon previous strategies of controlling for selective fertility. The data provide identifiers of the mother and father, which enable us to compare health outcomes of babies born to the same parents. In this way, we control for the possibility that parents select into pregnancy depending on the state of the business cycle. Most existing studies on developed countries could at most use mother fixed effects to address selective fertility. An exception is Aparicio and González (2014), who also use parents fixed effects but have less detailed unemployment information.==== Unlike all these studies, this paper is the first that controls for selective fertility and finds robust evidence for countercyclical effects on newborn health: Higher unemployment significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal mortality and very low birth weight. Our point estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a ca. 10% decrease in these health outcomes, but standard errors are quite large. The effect is entirely driven by the unemployment rate of men. We also find evidence for selective fertility over the cycle, which underlines the importance of controlling for parental fixed effects.====Third, we exploit the rich socio-economic and demographic information about the parents to explore some of the underlying mechanisms. First of all, we consider the role of actual parental unemployment, which is more prevalent in times of recessions. This sheds some light on whether health-enhancing activities – due to lower opportunity cost of time – or reduced smoking and drinking – due to lower available income – drive the estimated effects. We find that parental job loss does not play an important role in mediating the beneficial effects of recessions. As a next step, we investigate whether the effects vary by socio-economic status (SES) of the parents. Low-SES parents tend to be hit harder by recessions. We also find that recessions decrease the occurrence of premature birth. Somewhat speculatively, these findings are in line with a pathway through air pollution which is plausibly reduced in recessions and has been shown to disproportionately affect low-SES families and to provoke premature birth in prior work. Our paper also contributes to the literature on birth weight determinants. In particular, the effect sizes on the incidence of low birth weight may be compared to those due to other interventions (Currie, Cole, 1993, Kaestner, Lee, 2005, Kramer, 1987).====This paper is structured as follows: Sections 2 and 3 explain the data and econometric method, respectively. Section 4 presents the results, starting with an analysis of selective fertility. We then report baseline effects on newborn health, followed by a sensitivity analysis, and an investigation into heterogeneity and potential mechanisms.

According to the OECD, in 2015 about 244 million people were living outside their country of origin, more than half of them in G20 countries. In recent years, many of these countries have seen a significant rise in migration trends: between 2010 and 2015, net migration added about 10 million people to total population (OECD, 2017a).====The effects of immigration for the rich receiving countries have been widely investigated. However, while there is a vast literature considering the labour market effects of immigration (e.g. Ottaviano and Peri, 2012, for the US; D'Amuri et al., 2010, for Germany; Manacorda et al., 2012, for the UK), less has been done to study how immigration affects the educational choices of young natives. This paper adds to the small literature on the latter topic by focusing on Italy, a country that has only recently become a destination of international migration and that attracts mainly low-skilled immigrants from developing countries.====Previous contributions (see for instance Betts, 1998) point to two opposite effects of low skilled immigration on the education of natives. On the one hand, a large inflow of immigrants reduces the schooling resources available to natives. School quality declines and natives invest less. On the other hand, low skilled immigration increases the supply of low skilled labour. When low and high skills are complements in production, a higher supply of low skills reduces the wages and employment probabilities of the low skilled and increases the productivity and wages of the high skilled. Consequently, returns to education raise and natives have stronger incentives to acquire additional schooling.====Recent empirical research suggests that the balance of these effects is positive and that low skilled immigration raises the human capital investment of natives (see for instance McHenry, 2015 and Hunt, 2016). Not all natives, however, are positively affected. According to Llull, 2014, some are more likely to pursue a white - collar career and extend their stay in school. Others become more detached from the labour market and, given the lower expected return to their investment, drop out from school earlier, reducing their education.====Using data from Italy, we contribute to this literature by showing that in this country the observed increase in low skilled immigration has raised - with respect to the counterfactual of constant immigration - both the share of young natives (males in the whole country and females in the industrialized North) with college or enroled in college and the share of low educated natives (males and females) who have completed compulsory education but are not engaged in further education, thus attenuating the downward trend in the share of low educated natives and accelerating the upward trend in the share of natives with higher education.====Our empirical analysis combines local labour market data on young natives drawn from the Italian Labour Force Survey with data on legal immigrants drawn from other official sources. We recognize that the empirical relationship between the human capital choices of natives and immigration is influenced by the fact that immigrants are not randomly allocated across local areas. We address the endogeneity of immigration by using the shift-share instrument proposed by Card, 2001a, which exploits the tendency of immigrants to locate in areas where previous immigrants of the same ethnicity settled.====Our identifying assumption is that the local economic shocks attracting immigrants in the past (in our case, 1991) are uncorrelated with the educational choices of natives occurring more than 15 years later, conditional on a battery of controls.==== In support of our identification strategy, we investigate the validity of the exclusion restriction by implementing the tests designed by Oster, 2019, Conley et al., 2012, Mitaritonna et al., 2017 and Jaeger et al., 2018.====We show that our empirical results can be explained by adapting a standard model of educational choice (see Card, 2001b) to accommodate immigration. Following higher immigration, the marginal benefits of education rise for college but fall for lower education, because low skilled immigrants are substitutes for low to medium skilled natives but complements for high skilled natives.====When lower secondary education is compulsory and natives differ in their costs of education, these changes in marginal benefits increase the share of natives investing in college and reduce the share of those investing a few years longer than lower secondary education, for instance to complete short term vocational courses, thus raising the share with only compulsory education. We estimate wage equations by gender and find that the conditions required for immigration to increase the share of both lower and higher educated natives are satisfied, especially for Italian males.====While these effects show up very clearly for native males, they are somewhat less obvious for females. On the one hand, we find evidence that higher immigration increases the share of lower educated females who are not engaged in education or training; on the other hand, we find a negative but very imprecise effect on college enrolment or attainment. We interpret this result by pointing out that many Italian females with a college degree are either employed in jobs requiring less than college, suggesting that they and low skilled immigrants may be substitutes rather than complements, or work in the public sector, which is less permeable to the influence of immigrants. We also notice that the impact of immigration on educated females is positive in the industrialized North and negative in less developed areas, where good jobs outside the public sector are scarcer.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We start with a review of the literature in Section 1. Section 2 motivates why we treat immigration in Italy as low skilled and Section 3 introduces an illustrative model of educational choice. Section 4 presents the data and Section 5 describes our empirical approach. The main results are discussed in Section 6.

When calibrated to the high levels of worker flows observed empirically, unemployment in these models rapidly converges back to its steady state level. We illustrate that even with high worker flows between employment and unemployment, slow movements in the composition of workers across groups with different baseline unemployment rates can generate substantial persistence. To quantitatively assess the importance of these compositional changes, we develop a search model with worker experience and skill loss. When the model is calibrated to match empirical evidence on labor market outcomes that vary with tenure and worker displacement, the model endogenously generates substantial persistence in unemployment.","Fluctuations in monthly unemployment rates are highly persistent. Depending on the detrending method used, the autocorrelation of monthly unemployment rates in the U.S. ranges between 0.97 and 0.99, with even higher values for prime age workers. This implies a half-life of unemployment fluctuations ranging between 22 and 83 months.====Intuitively, one might expect that search frictions, as in Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), could generate sizable persistence. It is well known that the standard search model with these frictions struggles to replicate the volatility of unemployment, but a number of papers have further pointed out the inability of these frictions to, by themselves, generate persistent unemployment fluctuations. Pries (2004) observes that when the standard model is calibrated to match average levels of worker flows, the quantitative contribution of these frictions is quite small, generating virtually no internal propagation. While the addition of persistent productivity shocks can generate persistent unemployment fluctuations, Shimer (2005) points out the persistence of the standard productivity shock in the calibrated Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides (DMP) model generates persistent unemployment through unrealistic counterfactual mechanisms.==== Fujita and Ramey (2007) and Elsby et al. (2015) further argue that the standard model with these persistent shocks fails to generate realistic propagation, as it fails to reproduce the full dynamics of unemployment persistence in the short and long run. Thus, an important question is whether there are additional internal propagation mechanisms that can endogenously generate unemployment persistence.====In this paper, we study the propagation of unemployment fluctuations stemming from compositional changes across worker groups with different baseline unemployment rates. The inclusion of compositional changes can potentially have a significant quantitative impact on the dynamics of unemployment in a standard search model. If, in a recession, the composition of workers shifts towards workers with high unemployment rates, this will naturally amplify fluctuations in unemployment over the business cycle. Further, if changes in composition are persistent, then they will also increase the persistence of unemployment in response to a shock.====To illustrate this channel, we begin by considering a simple model of worker flows. In the model with homogeneous workers, the autocorrelation of unemployment is given by ==== where ==== and ==== are the probabilities of job separation and job finding respectively. In the U.S., ==== implying little persistence in unemployment fluctuations, having a half-life of 1–2 months. Even with levels of worker flows observed in recessions or across heterogeneous worker groups, flows are sufficiently high to generate rapid convergence.====We then extend the simple flow model of unemployment by allowing for two worker groups – inexperienced and experienced. In this environment, workers can gain experience while employed, which places them in a state with lower separation rates and higher job finding probabilities. On the other hand, when a worker separates from his job he can lose skill, returning to the inexperienced state. With multiple worker groups, the aggregate unemployment rate now depends not only on the unemployment rate within groups, but the composition of the labor force across these groups. In this environment, the persistence of any compositional shift depends on the flows between groups, similar to how the persistence of unemployment within groups depends on worker flows between employment and unemployment. If flows across worker groups are low, then compositional changes will generate persistent fluctuations in unemployment.====To quantitatively assess this mechanism, we embed the compositional change channel within a standard DMP model with productivity shocks. We extend the model to have workers in three different experience states: inexperienced, experienced, and displaced. Displaced workers are those who have lost skills when they separate from an experienced job. The worker heterogeneity involved in our compositional framework is generally unobservable and workers can transition across groups. We proxy for these three types empirically using data on employer tenure to distinguish between experienced and inexperienced workers and data on displaced workers as measured in the Current Population Survey. Allowing for this displaced state allows for careful empirical discipline of compositional changes using evidence from the literature on worker displacement. Flows into and out of displacement are the key compositional flows impacting persistence in the model.====The calibrated model matches empirical patterns of wages, job finding probabilities, and job separation probabilities for low tenure, high tenure, and displaced workers. Displaced workers have a higher baseline unemployment rate, stemming from a slightly higher probability of job separation and a much lower job finding probability. Thus, a compositional shift toward these workers will increase the aggregate unemployment rate. Our calibration implies that increased unemployment ==== experience groups converges rapidly to the steady state since worker flows within each group are high. However, when increased unemployment arises from changes in the composition of workers ==== experience groups, with an increase in the share of workers who are displaced, it converges much more gradually.====The magnitude of persistence generated from this channel depends on how much the composition of workers changes with the business cycle. Mueller (2017) and Huckfeldt (2016) document that in recessions the previous wage among recently unemployed workers rises and the incidence of downward occupational switching increases. We interpret these findings in our framework as a relative increase in separations by experienced workers and a higher incidence of skill loss among those separations. Both factors lead to increased inflows to displacement during recessions and we use them to empirically discipline the cyclical variation in the composition of workers in our model.====In our simulations with persistent productivity shocks, we find that the cyclical compositional changes induced by matching these empirical patterns increases the persistence of unemployment. Allowing for cyclical compositional change increases unemployment persistence in the model by 40%, as measured by the half-life implied by the autocorrelation coefficient. Importantly, however, with the inclusion of cyclical changes in the composition of workers, the aggregate unemployment rate is not well described by a simple AR(1) process and so autocorrelation coefficients and implied half-lives provide an incomplete description of the persistence of unemployment. Impulse responses of unemployment to a negative shock in simulations with and without compositional change look similar for the first year after a shock, however, their long run behavior diverges substantially. In simulations without cyclical compositional changes, unemployment falls to 25% of the peak within four years of the initial shock. In contrast, with cyclical compositional changes, it takes more than 10 years to fall to 25% of the peak. Thus, the added mechanism of compositional change is particularly effective at increasing unemployment persistence in the long-run.====Our paper relates to the literature studying internal propagation mechanisms to generate persistence in search and matching models, including Pries (2004) and Fujita and Ramey (2007). Pries (2004) is closely related to our work as he also considers an environment with compositional change. In his model of worker-firm learning, economic downturns coincide with both decreased match quality and increased uncertainty about the quality of existing matches. Matches with uncertain quality, including new matches, face a higher risk of separation. Thus, increases in uncertainty generate compositional changes towards workers with higher unemployment rates and slow convergence because of recurring separations amongst the newly unemployed. We view this as a potential example of the type of compositional channel we emphasize and thus complementary to the skill composition channel we illustrate. Relative to Pries (2004), we are able to provide tighter empirical discipline on the magnitudes of compositional change over the business cycle, providing additional quantitative evidence in favor of the importance of compositional change.====Our paper also relates to the literature studying the quantitative properties of the standard search and matching model, including Shimer (2005) who finds that the standard model generates less than 10% of the volatility of unemployment observed in the data.==== While our primary emphasis is on the propagation of unemployment, we note that the inclusion of cyclical changes in composition provides an additional mechanism that amplifies unemployment fluctuations. Our simulations with cyclical changes in composition generate a standard deviation of unemployment fluctuations that is roughly 15–30% larger than counterfactuals without cyclical composition changes.====Ferraro (2018) studies the quantitative properties of the DMP model by extending an otherwise standard search and matching model to have worker heterogeneity. He shows that endogenous separations and changes in the composition of the unemployed across skill levels can generate volatile and asymmetric fluctuations in unemployment, as in the data. While we do not allow for endogenous separations, our model allows for realistic transitions between skill levels; in Ferraro (2018) a worker’s skill is fixed over time. Given these transitions, our model generates added persistence and volatility in unemployment from cyclical composition changes while still being consistent with evidence from Mueller (2017) that unemployment rates are most volatile for high skilled workers. The model of Ferraro (2018) implies the opposite, that unemployment rates are most cyclical for low-skilled workers.====Our paper also relates to the search and matching literature on skill loss. Early papers in this literature, such as Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) and den Haan et al. (2005), asked whether increased levels of steady state skill loss could generate higher levels of steady state unemployment to reconcile the European experience since the 1980s.==== den Haan et al. (2005) argue that skill loss coupled with endogenous separations could lead to a lower steady state level of separations, and actually lower unemployment.==== However, these criticisms are unlikely to apply to our context, as we study cyclical movements in skill loss. Separations, especially involuntary ones, increase in recessions, including among higher skilled workers, as shown in Mueller (2017).====Another complementary propagation channel is a thin market externality, as proposed by Pissarides (1992). This externality occurs when downturns coincide with an increase in the fraction of low productivity workers in the unemployment pool so that firms have a lower incentive to post vacancies, decreasing job finding rates. Both Pries (2008) and Ravenna and Walsh (2012) study the impact of this channel in amplifying unemployment fluctuations. In their frameworks, workers are ex ante heterogeneous and they find that increases in the fraction of low productivity workers in the unemployment pool amplify unemployment fluctuations. Workers in our model are instead ex ante homogeneous, but change types as they gain or lose experience over time and search in separate markets corresponding to their experience, so that there is no thin market externality.==== Lalé (2018) also studies the role of skill loss and the thin market externality on amplification in an environment where workers can gain or lose skill over time. However, in his work, workers of different productivity levels have identical separation and job finding rates. In our model, differences in worker flows across groups are central to how compositional change generates persistent aggregate unemployment fluctuations.====A recent literature including Jarosch (2014), Huckfeldt (2016), Jung and Kuhn (2018), and Krolikowski (2017) focuses on extending search and matching models to account for the earnings losses of displaced workers. Similar to the spirit of our calibration, Jung and Kuhn (2018) aim to account for worker flows over the life cycle and across years of employer tenure. However, as with most of these papers, there is no discussion of cyclical movements in earnings losses or unemployment. A notable exception to this is Huckfeldt (2016), who proposes a model of endogenously selective hiring to explain the countercyclical earnings losses by displaced workers. As his paper does not examine the persistence of aggregate unemployment, we view our work as complementary to his findings.====Finally, our findings may seem at odds with the results of Shimer (2012), who argues that fluctuations in separation rates and the composition of the workforce across observable characteristics (e.g. age, sex, race, education) contribute minimally to aggregate unemployment fluctuations. However, recent work in Ahn and Hamilton (2016), Mueller (2017), Munro (2018), and Hall and Schulhofer-Wohl (2018) find an important role for compositional changes, either through additional observables (e.g. the prior wage of the unemployed or the reason for unemployment) or through unobservable heterogeneity. Further, the compositional changes we envision are distinct from those originally considered by Shimer (2012). In our model, a worker’s type is not permanent, but can change over time with gaining or losing experience, and Shimer (2012) acknowledges that changes like these in a worker’s type could be an important exception to his findings. With regard to whether fluctuations in separation or job finding rates are key drivers of cyclical changes in unemployment, we conduct the a similar decomposition as in Shimer (2012) and find that the majority of unemployment fluctuations are generated by movements in job finding rates. Although skill loss happens at the point of separation, this result occurs because displaced workers have such low job finding rates that compositional changes have a particularly large impact on the aggregate job finding rate.","Experience, skill composition, and the persistence of unemployment fluctuations",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119301290,25 December 2019,2019,Research Article,317.0

How does this inflow affect labor market outcomes among highly skilled native-born workers? I estimate a labor market equilibrium model in which individuals adjust to skilled immigration by changing occupations and investing in human capital differently. I also estimate the demand functions for native and immigrant workers and find that skilled immigrants and natives are imperfect substitutes in some occupations but are complements in others. Counterfactual exercises indicate that even large inflows of foreign skilled workers have limited impacts on domestic workers. In particular, the skill rental rates for native science and engineering workers would have been approximately 2% higher if firms were not able to hire more foreigners than they did in 1994. On the other hand, had the U.S. workers been constrained to remain in their original occupations, the adverse impacts of foreign labor competition would be more severe. When natives’ ==== respond to immigration, the negative effects are diffused.","Contrary to popular perception, many of the immigrants to the U.S. in the last decades were highly skilled. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of skilled immigrants residing in the U.S. rose by about 4.8% annually.==== Today, 16% of the U.S. workers with a bachelor’s education are immigrants. The inflow of immigrants has furthermore been unevenly spread; 25% of computer scientists and electronics engineers are immigrants, but only 6% of those working in the legal professions are. Basic economic arguments (Borjas, 1999) suggest that such an unbalanced and sizable flow of migrants might have substantial and detrimental effects on natives with similar skills working in the same professions. Given the empirical distribution of skilled migrants across occupations, we expect any labor market effects to be largest among U.S. workers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations (Table 1).==== However, with a few exceptions (Peri, Shih, Sparber, 2015, Hanson, Slaughter, 2016, Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015), the literature so far has neglected the question of how skilled immigrants have affected native born workers in the STEM fields. How do natives’ human capital decisions react to skilled immigration? Would they have specialized in different occupations?====STEM occupations are the fundamental inputs in scientific innovation and technological adoption which, in turn, are the main drivers of the productivity growth in the US (Peri et al., 2015). There has been a concern about the shortage of STEM workers in the US. The H1B visa was introduced to allow access into the US to professional STEM workers. This paper focuses on the direct impact of skilled immigration introduced by the H1B temporary visa program. The approach I take here focus on the directly impacted STEM labor market, thus it precludes any analysis of the overall welfare impact of the skilled immigration on the Non-STEM labor market.====A comprehensive answer to previous research questions is crucial to understand the economic impacts of skilled immigrant inflows, and the answer requires multiple key inputs. First, we need to estimate the demand for skilled workers across occupations. Second, we need to understand how the native-born workers choose occupations and whether occupational switching can serve as a pressure-valve mitigating and diffusing any consequences of the inflows of skilled immigrants. In particular, I build a labor market equilibrium model focusing on dynamic occupational choices of native workers with the following key features: (a) skilled natives and immigrants are allowed to be imperfect substitutes or complements, and substitutability or complementarity can vary across occupations; (b) workers are heterogeneous in terms of their multi-dimensional abilities; (c) workers accumulate occupation-specific human capital through learning-by-doing, and (d) the occupation-specific human capital is partially transferable across occupations.====In this paper, the proposed and estimated labor market equilibrium model is used to identify the wage impacts of skilled immigration in the STEM fields over the last two decades, taking into consideration of occupational adjustments by natives. The labor market equilibrium approach departs from the recent literature and allows me to address the following main points.====First, I estimate the labor demand functions across different occupations. With regard to the corresponding production functions, there are two streams in the literature. One type of common assumption is that native and immigrant workers of the same type are perfect substitutes (Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015, Dustmann, Frattini, Preston, 2012). This assumption of perfect substitutability is not innocuous, as it considers the impacts of immigrants only within the scope of direct competition. In other papers (Llull, 2018, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012, Peri, Sparber, 2009), native and immigrant workers are imperfect substitutes in the production process because they work in different occupations based on their skills.==== This paper falls into the second stream. Besides allowing for the endogenous occupation adjustment following (Llull, 2018a), the general production function in this paper allows native and immigrant workers to be imperfect substitutes or, more importantly, complements even conditional on occupational choices and labor market experience. Allowing the possibility of complementarity adds a potential beneficial side to the story to avoid the overestimation of negative impacts. Moreover, the production functions allow the substitution elasticity to vary across occupations, which would better capture the asymmetric impacts of immigrants across occupations.====Second, by explicitly modeling occupational choices by natives, I can quantify and correct the biases in the estimated effects of immigration on wages introduced by ignoring native workers’ labor market adjustments. Another common assumption in the literature is the fixed native labor supply in narrowly defined labor markets (Borjas, 1999, Borjas, 2003, Llull, 2018, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012). Failing to account for native workers’ adjustments may lead to a substantial bias in the estimated wage impacts of skilled immigration. Using the estimated model, I identify that a non trivial fraction of native workers adjust their occupational choices in response to foreign labor competition, which mitigates any initial impacts through diffusion. Occupational adjustments to immigration have been studied by Peri and Sparber (2009) and Llull (2018a). This paper complements to the previous two by explicitly studying the occupational responses by native workers in the context of skilled labor market.====Third, the equilibrium model with multiple occupations allows me to evaluate the impacts of a selective immigration policy based on occupations that would not be possible otherwise. Llull (2018c) poses and estimates a labor market equilibrium to study the immigration policies that change the skill composition of immigrants in the U.S.==== However, this paper focuses exclusively on selective immigration policies based on occupation.====The two-sector equilibrium model (Computer Science occupations (CS) v.s. Other-STEM occupations) builds on work by Lee (2005), Lee and Wolpin (2006) and Llull (2018a).==== Besides the computational simplicity, I focus these two occupations based on the following reason. During the period of interest, we observe a substantial increase in the number of temporary non-immigrant visas awarded to high skilled workers in the STEM occupations, and individuals with computer-related occupations becoming the largest share of H1B visa holders (Bound et al., 2015). Given these circumstances, it is of considerable interest to investigate how the inflow of skilled immigrants affect the labor market outcomes for US STEM workers as a whole and US computer scientists during this period.====The supply side of the model extends the structure of Keane, Wolpin, 1994, Keane, Wolpin, 1997. Native workers from age 22 to 65 make yearly forward-looking decisions about their occupational choices. Native workers differ in their innate abilities for working in either sector.==== Agents choose their occupations according to their comparative advantage (Roy, 1951), which evolves over time because human capital accumulates throughout the life-cycle. Learning-by-doing on the job leads to accumulation of occupation-specific human capital that is only partially transferable across occupations. Switching occupations is costly in the current model due to the loss of previous accumulated human capital. In their human capital investment decisions, natives make forecasts about future wages, which depend on future inflows of skilled immigration and future sector specific productivity shocks. Individuals are assumed to be able to perfectly foresee future career prospects when making decisions.==== Skilled foreign workers are allowed to accumulate human capital through learning-by-doing as well. However, the lack of portability of the H-1B visa across occupations restricts their occupational mobility after entering the U.S. labor market (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010).====In this model, the supply of foreign workers is directly taken from the data and is exogenously determined by the U.S. immigration policies (H-1B visa regulations). The decision to migrate to the U.S. is specified outside of the model similar to Llull (2018a).==== The features of the H-1B visa effectively separate the foreign labor supply from the labor demand, which provides plausible exogenous variations to identify the occupation-specific production functions. See Section 2 and Section 3.1.2 for more details.====On the labor demand side, I assume a nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function that uses both domestic and immigrant labor in the production process. The nested-CES function allows for imperfect substitutability between native and immigrant labor similarly as in Ottaviano and Peri (2012) and Peri and Sparber (2009). The current setup has an embedded channel of imperfect substitutability which occur endogenously through different occupational decisions of natives and immigrants on the labor supply side (Llull, 2018a). The nested-CES function provides an additional channel for the imperfect substitutability that native and immigrants workers are not perfectly substitutable even conditional on their occupational choices. Furthermore, the flexible specification incorporates the asymmetric effects of skilled immigration across occupations.==== It also captures the immigrant-native interaction happening through both labor market and output market.====I fit he model to U.S. data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The model is identified by combining the structural assumptions with the exogenous variation in the flow of skilled immigrants.==== I then use the estimated parameters to quantify the effect of skilled immigration on labor market outcomes.====My estimation results add to the previous papers (Peri, Sparber, 2009, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012, Manacorda, Manning, Wadsworth, 2012), finding that skilled native and foreign labor are imperfect substitutes in the CS occupations and more interestingly are complements in the Other-STEM occupations. I then explore the O*NET data to provide evidence for the micro-structure of these finding. Task specialization within occupations is a potential source that can explain these findings.====With the estimated parameters, I first quantify the effect of skilled immigration on the STEM occupations. I consider a counterfactual economy in which the total foreign skilled labor supply is kept constant at its 1994 level. This experiment attempts to determine the impact of immigration policies on total quantity restriction, such as the variations in the H-1B cap. I find a very limited impact on native workers even for large inflows of skilled immigrants. Wages of skilled domestic workers, on average, increase only by 2.41% due to this highly restrictive counterfactual policy.====A universal restriction on the number of skilled immigrants may be suboptimal. The economy can improve its performance with selective immigration policies that favor occupations where complementarity exists.==== Thus, in the second set of counterfactual analysis, I manipulate the occupation mix of skilled immigrants to replicate the effect of a selective immigration policy. The foreign labor in the Other-STEM occupations increases while that of the CS occupations are fixed. Optimizing the occupation mix of skilled immigrants achieves a Pareto improvement. Workers in the occupations where complementarity exists experience a direct increase in wages due to inflows of skilled immigrants, while others experience a positive spillover effect as a result of native workers’ occupational mobility.====This paper contributes to a growing body of literature that studies the impacts of skilled immigration on U.S. labor market outcomes (Kerr, Lincoln, 2010, Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010, Hunt, 2011, Hunt, 2015, Borjas, Doran, 2012, Moser, Voena, Waldinger, 2014, Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015).==== Motivated by the empirical evidence documented in Peri and Sparber (2011), Peri et al. (2015), and D’Amuri and Peri (2014), the main focus of this paper is on domestic workers’ occupational adjustments in response to skilled immigration. Adding this adjustment margin relaxes the assumption of fixed labor supply like in Borjas (2003), Card (2009), Ottaviano and Peri (2012), or Llull (2018b). In the paper, I identify a non-trivial portion of domestic workers switching occupations in response to inflows of skilled immigrants, which highlights the importance of accounting for natives occupational adjustments when quantifying the wage impact of immigration. Llull (2018a) studies three adjustment mechanisms of native workers: education, occupation, and labor participation. The occupational adjustments in this paper have a very similar flavor. This paper departs from previous papers in two additional dimensions. The first one is using flexible enough production functions to allow natives and immigrants to be imperfect substitutes or even complements. The paper combines two channels for imperfect substitutability. First, native and immigrants are different because they make different occupational decisions as in Llull (2018a). Second, conditional on occupations, they enter the nest-CES production function as two different types of labor which is due to task specialization. This enlarges the scope within which we discuss the impact of skilled immigration. Bound et al. (2015) assume natives and immigrants are perfect substitutes. With a normal downward sloping labor demand, their model only captures half of the story. My model further allows the elasticity of substitution between natives and immigrants to vary across occupations. This extends the setup in Ottaviano and Peri (2012) that better captures the asymmetric effects of skilled immigration across occupations and generates correct incentives of occupational mobility, eventually allowing the model to evaluate the effect of selective immigration policies.====Studying the native’s internal migration in response to immigration adds to another strand of the literature. In the literature, Card (2001), Borjas (2006), and Piyapromdee (2017), model the spatial equilibrium responses to immigration in a static framework, estimating the wage effect of immigration across different local labor markets and finding mixed evidence of this adjustment margin.==== The role of geographic mobility in these papers is analogous to the occupational mobility here: both geographic and occupational mobility mitigate the wage effects of immigration through diffusion in equilibrium.====There are few structural papers studying natives’ occupational response to foreign competition. Bound et al. (2015) and Llull (2018a) are the only ones, to my knowledge, falling into this category. Bound et al. (2015) utilize a calibrated model to analyze the employment and wage adjustment of native computer scientists. The partial equilibrium setting in their study focuses only on the market for computer scientists and misses the wider impacts that high-skilled immigration might have on the U.S. economy. Llull (2018a) proposes a rich model incorporating the educational, occupational, and participation adjustments of natives to immigration, which mitigate initial effects on wages and inequality through diffusion. Llull (2018a) identifies a significant heterogeneity in these adjustments both across individuals and across different margins. In this paper, I focus mainly on the occupational adjustment margin but add more structures to the production functions. This model provides us some new insights into the effects of changing the immigrant occupational composition, like the OPT in the U.S., which has not been studied in the previous papers.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the OPT and the H-1B visa program in the U.S. Section 3 specifies the model and Section 5.1 discusses the data, identification, and estimation procedure.

We find a strong, positive relationship between the effectiveness of a teacher's mentor and their own effectiveness in math and a more modest relationship in English Language Arts. The relationship in math is strongest early in a teacher's career, and would be positive and statistically significant even in the presence of non-random sorting on unobservables of the same magnitude as the sorting on observables. This suggests that at least some of this relationship reflects a causal relationship between mentor effectiveness and the future effectiveness of their mentees in math.","Does working with a more effective mentor improve the productivity of mentees? This very basic question has received little empirical attention despite the prevalence of mentoring across a variety of educational and occupational settings. A 2002 publication by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, reports that there are over 800 apprenticeable occupations (Crosby, 2002). Formalized apprenticeships in which prospective labor market participants are mentored as part of their preparation are an occupational licensing requirement prior to workforce entry in many occupations such as nursing, medicine, clinical social work, and teaching (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). There are about half a million individuals being trained each year in these occupations alone.==== In a study of occupational licensing, Kleiner and Krueger (2013) report that nearly 30% of employees were licensed and that about half of these require apprenticeships. Thus, it is clear that knowing more about what constitutes a high-quality apprenticeship should inform the training of a large segment of the U.S. workforce.====This paper explores whether a key aspect of apprenticeships, the effectiveness of the mentor who supervises the apprenticeship, is predictive of the labor market productivity of mentees. We use a novel database that includes nearly a decade of data on the preservice apprenticeships (“student teaching placements”) of teacher candidates in Washington State—linked to data on the workforce outcomes of these candidates once they become K-12 teachers—to address the question of whether assignment to a more effective mentor teacher during these apprenticeships impacts the effectiveness of student teachers who become teachers themselves. This work builds on prior work on the mentorship of ==== teachers (e.g., Papay et al., 2016; Rockoff, 2008), and follows a similar study that used more limited data (see Section 2) to investigate the same question about ==== teachers in Tennessee (Ronfeldt et al., 2018a). Importantly, this is the first study to consider mentor productivity as measured ==== the mentor-mentee relationship to investigate this key question.====There are a number of reasons to focus on the connection between mentor and mentee productivity in the case of teaching. First, teachers are the single largest college-educated profession—there are over three million public school teachers—and education is a major industry, with K–12 public school education expenditures in the United States comprising approximately 4% of GDP. Moreover, the vast majority of these three million public school teachers served as student teachers in the past as will the majority of teacher candidates today. Teachers have also been shown to play a critical role in the creation of future human capital.==== Finally, and importantly for the purposes of the study, there is a well-established measure of labor market productivity for teachers—the “value added” that teachers contribute toward student achievement test scores (discussed more extensively below)—permitting a direct link between the productivity of mentors and mentees.==== It is important to note that value added is ==== direct measure of the quality of mentorship provided by mentors, but to the extent that teaching quality and mentorship quality are correlated, this measure helps us understand how much mentees benefit from a high-quality mentor.====We find evidence of a strong and positive relationship between value-added measures of mentor effectiveness and mentees’ value-added effectiveness in math, and more modest relationships in English Language Arts (ELA). Specifically, across a variety of specifications, apprenticing with mentors whose value added is one standard deviation higher is associated with roughly 10–20% of a standard deviation higher value added of mentees in math and (an inconsistently statistically significant) 5–12% of a standard deviation higher value added in ELA.==== The increase in math value added associated with a one standard deviation increase in mentor quality is roughly equivalent to the difference in average value added between a novice and second-year teacher; in other words, the expected gain in teacher effectiveness from assignment to a more effective mentor is equivalent to the well-documented returns to the first year of teaching experience (e.g., Ladd and Sorensen, 2017; Rivkin et al., 2005; Rockoff, 2004).====Our findings are robust to the inclusion of various in-service measures of mentor quality (e.g., experience and degree level) and preservice measures of mentee quality (e.g., teacher preparation program and licensure test scores), but there are several potential threats to the causal interpretation of the above estimates. Most importantly, prior quantitative (Krieg et al., 2016, 2019) and qualitative (St. John et al., 2018) evidence from Washington State (the setting of this study) documents considerable non-random sorting of teacher candidates to mentor teachers. While we can account for sorting along observable dimensions—for example, the sorting of candidates with higher licensure test scores to mentors with higher value added documented in Krieg et al. (2016, 2019)—it is plausible that positive sorting of teacher candidates who ==== to more effective mentors ==== may explain at least some of the estimated relationships discussed above.====We address this threat to validity by following the approach of Altonji et al. (2005, 2008) and Oster (2017) who provide methods for estimating the bias produced by different magnitudes of non-random sorting. We show that under plausible scenarios—including a scenario in which the amount of sorting on unobservable dimensions is the same as the amount of sorting on observables—the relationship between mentor effectiveness in math and the future effectiveness of their mentees in math is still positive and statistically significant. We interpret this as evidence that at least some of this relationship reflects a causal relationship between mentor effectiveness and the future effectiveness of their mentees in math.",Effective like me?

Our study is based on register data at the municipality level from Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We document that a mine opening increases employment in the municipality where the mine is located and that the demand shock has a direct effect on the mining sector and propagates to other industries. Our results also reveal that mine openings increase the population, both in the municipality where the mine is located and in the surrounding region. Finally, we document that a mine opening increases the male share of the population of the municipalities, gives it a more pronounced U-shaped age profile, and that all education groups increase in size; the numbers, however, are larger for people with lower-level educations.","Mines and other large-scale projects can change societies. The establishment of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System had a dramatic impact on wages and employment in Alaska (Carrington, 1996), and large mining projects in Peru (Aragón and Rud, 2013) and the United States (Black et al., 2005) produced interesting economic and industry dynamics. What is less clear is how such projects shift a broader set of socioeconomic variables. To shed light on this issue, we study mine openings in the Nordic countries where the mining industry has a long tradition and where register data is available. This allows for a detailed assessment of how employment, the industry structure, and the human capital distribution change in a municipality when a new mine opens.====One theoretical model useful for studying large-scale projects is the spatial equilibrium model outlined in Moretti (2010, 2011). The model stresses that a demand shock (such as a mine opening) will have a direct effect on local employment in the affected industry, and that it will propagate to other industries such that the industry composition changes. We study these dynamics as well as changes in the human capital distribution.====Extractive industries have been studied extensively, and resource abundance has been linked to macroeconomic performance (Sachs and Warner, 1995, 1999, 2001; van der Ploeg, 2011). Sachs and Warner's prominent cross-country studies present evidence suggesting that countries with a high ratio of natural resource exports tend to have lower growth rates. In contrast, papers studying the effect of extractive industries using within-country variation often find positive effects on employment and income (Allcott and Keniston, 2014; Aragón and Rud, 2013; Black et al., 2005; Kline, 2008; Michaels, 2010). Our study falls into this latter category.====The effects of mines and other large-scale projects have been assessed using a variety of settings and methodologies. One class of papers identifies local impacts by studying one large-scale project. An important example is Carrington's (1996) study of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 70 s. Viewing the construction project as a substantial anticipated and temporary labor demand shock, he establishes significant positive shifts in employment, population, and earnings during construction and a reversion in earnings and the employment/population ratio once the pipeline was completed. Aragón and Rud (2013) take a related approach in studying the Yanacocha mine in Peru, which is one of the largest gold mines in the world. They find positive footprints of the mine on household income within a radius of 100 km from the mine.====A second class of papers uses geographical variation in the intensity of resource extraction or resource endowments. One such paper by Black et al. (2005) studies the impact of coal mines on local labor markets using the coal boom in the 70 s and the bust in the 80 s. An important finding from this study is that a booming coal industry has spillover effects to other locally-focused sectors such as construction, retail, and services. A related paper by Allcott and Keniston (2014) focuses on boom-and-bust effects in the oil and gas industry and establishes pro-cyclical movements in employment, migration, and wages. Another paper in this vein is the study of the long-term consequences of oil abundance in the Southern United States by Michaels (2010). This paper finds that oil-abundant counties had a higher population growth, a higher per capita income, and better infrastructure and that oil abundance created jobs in the mining and manufacturing industries. These results, however, stand in stark contrast to those established by Caselli and Michaels (2013), who use variation in oil endowments and production across municipalities in Brazil to establish that oil windfalls have moderate, if any, effects on local living standards, despite significant increases in reported spending on public goods and services.====The study by Kline (2008) represents a third class of papers. Kline uses (exogenous) variation in world prices of crude petroleum between 1972 and 2002 to study the effects on employment, hours, and wages in the US oil and gas field services industry. The results show that employment and hours respond immediately to higher prices and that wages respond somewhat later.====The study most similar to ours is that of Kotsadam and Tolonen (2016), who use a multi-country longitudinal survey spanning the African continent and complementary information on mine locations to investigate the gender-specific employment effects of mine openings and closings. In their analysis, they find that large-scale mining in Africa produces local boom-bust economies with transient gender-specific employment effects.====Our study differs from these earlier papers by paying particular attention to the Nordic context and to the life cycle of mines. Using the register data available in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, we show that mines have large local impacts. In particular, difference-in-difference, event study and synthetic control method estimates all show strong and positive employment effects in municipalities where new mines are established.====In addition to assessing the direct employment effects, we investigate how the demand shock impacts the industry structure. We are able to document that, in addition to high growth in the mining sector, other industries such as construction, the primary sector (excluding mining), and the electricity, gas and water supply industry also experience employment growth in response to a mine opening. Hence, in line with theory, there is clear evidence that the positive demand shock (to mining) propagates to a broader set of industries.====A key contribution of this paper is to address to what extent mine openings change a broader set of socioeconomic variables. A first result shedding light on this issue is that municipalities with mine openings experience a growth in population that matches the growth in employment. Mine openings have only moderate effects on unemployment and the number of people outside the labor force. The results also show that the male share of the municipality increases when a mine opens, but such an increase occurs late and is modest. Equally interesting is it to note that mine openings make the age distribution more U-shaped and lead to an increasing number of people in all education categories (however, the number for people with lower levels of education is larger).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the register data and the mines. In Section 3, we discuss our methodology, and we present results in Section 4.

Male students assigned to male peer advisors were significantly more likely to meet with their assigned PA, persist into the second year of postsecondary schooling, and graduate within four years. We find no such effect on male students’ academic performance, nor do we find a same-sex PA effect on female students’ use of the PA program or on subsequent academic outcomes.","Females now attend and complete college at significantly higher rates than males, and a similar gap exists between students from high- and low-income backgrounds (Bailey and Dynarski 2011; Bound and Turner 2011). These gaps concern policymakers who desire equal educational, social, and economic opportunities for all students (e.g., Rodríguez-Planas 2012), as education, particularly postsecondary education, improves a host of long-term socioeconomic outcomes, including earnings (Card 1999), civic engagement (Dee 2004a), health (Grossman 2006), and crime (Lochner and Moretti 2004). Moreover, there are social benefits (i.e., positive externalities) of a more educated population (Moretti 2004a,b) that motivate a policy response.====It is important, then, to identify the cost-effective interventions available to policymakers and college and university administrators that might close sociodemographic gaps in postsecondary educational success, particularly once students have matriculated, as male and first-generation college entrants complete college at lower rates than females and students with a history of college completion in their families, respectively (Bound and Turner 2011).====Advising and mentoring programs constitute one class of potentially beneficial interventions, as such programs provide information, guidance, and general support to students who lack these resources in their social networks (Angrist et al., 2009; Avery and Kane 2004; Bettinger et al., 2013; Deming and Dynarski 2009; Dynarski 2016; Evans et al., 2017; Rodríguez-Planas 2012). Indeed, mentoring and advising programs offered to high school seniors have been shown to increase high school graduation and college matriculation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations (Castleman and Page 2015; Castleman et al., 2014; Stephan and Rosenbaum 2013), and colleges and universities now offer a wide array of advising and support services (Carlstrom and Miller 2013).====However, there is relatively little causal evidence on the efficacy of postsecondary voluntary advising and mentoring interventions, and most observational studies are plagued by endogenous take-up of support services (Bettinger et al., 2013).==== Moreover, the handful of credibly designed studies that randomize access to support services yield mixed evidence (Rodríguez-Planas 2012). One plausible explanation for these mixed results is low take-up rates of voluntary advising, mentoring, and support services (Angrist et al., 2014). Interventions that proactively engage students tend to have larger impacts on students’ academic success than those that do not, which supports this hypothesis. For example, Bettinger and Baker (2014) investigate InsideTrack, a program in which coaches repeatedly reach out to nontraditional college students via phone, email, text, and social media, and find that the program significantly increased retention and degree completion. Similarly, Evans et al. (2017) find that a comprehensive, multi-pronged case management intervention in which community college students were assigned a dedicated case manager (coach) tripled degree receipt among female students. Still, take-up was not universal and was higher among females.====An open question of first-order importance to both the design and evaluation of such programs, then, is what malleable, cost-effective policy levers are available to postsecondary institutions that aim to increase students’ take-up and engagement of voluntary on-campus advising, mentoring, and support programs? The causal determinants of student take-up of such programs are largely unknown, though take-up is likely malleable. For example, a field experiment conducted at Reed College in Oregon finds that postcard advertisements for peer tutoring services increased the use of tutoring by about 20% (Pugatch and Wilson 2018).====We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on how assignment to a same-sex peer advisor affects students’ engagement with a voluntary peer-advising program at American University, which is a selective, midsized, private, non-for-profit university.==== We address these research questions using rich administrative data from two cohorts of first-year undergraduate students at American University. Specifically, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of peer advisors to first-semester university students and find that male students assigned to male peer advisors are more likely to engage their peer advisor than are males assigned to female peer advisors; there is no such sex-match effect for female students.====Moreover, male students benefit from random assignment to male peer advisors: reduced-form estimates show that male students assigned to male peer advisors are more likely to persist into their second year of college and to graduate (or remain enrolled) in four years than are males assigned to female peer advisors. However, there is no such effect on course grades, which is unsurprising given the non-academic focus of the peer-advising program. The reduced form estimates provide causal evidence that being assigned to a same-sex peer advisor increases male students’ likelihood of persistence and graduation. Qualitative evidence from exit surveys of program participants comport with the quantitative results and provide additional insights into students’ reasons for engaging the peer advisor and the channels through which peer advising increased student persistence.","Gender, peer advising, and college success",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119301113,23 November 2019,2019,Research Article,321.0

In many countries, young firms create most jobs during their start-up period (Fölster, 2000; Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Sedláček and Sterk, 2017; Heyman et al., 2018). Yet many entrepreneurs also start businesses because they see no better employment options, particularly in developing countries where underemployment is prevalent and wage jobs are rare (Schoar, 2010). Policy makers around the world have been interested in stimulating and facilitating entrepreneurship. Youth employment is often of particular policy concern since unemployment is higher for youths than for adults in many countries. The transition from education to work can also be lengthy, especially in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa. To help address this issue, policy makers have considered fostering skills for entrepreneurship before youths exit the education system. Entrepreneurship education and training programs have rapidly expanded in developed and developing countries alike (Kuratko, 2005; Valerio et al., 2014).====Despite the popularity of entrepreneurship education, evidence of its effectiveness in improving employment outcomes over the medium to long-term is lacking. Existing evidence tends to focus on impacts on participants’ intentions while in school, not on actual project creation or employment outcomes after students have graduated and joined the labor market (for meta-reviews, see Bae et al., 2014; Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015; Martin et al., 2013; Nabi et al., 2017 or Valerio et al., 2014). Observed impacts on entrepreneurial intentions vary substantially. For example, Peterman and Kennedy (2003) and Souitaris et al. (2007) find some impacts of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial intentions among secondary school and university students, respectively. Rosendahl Huber et al. (2014) perform a randomized experiment of an entrepreneurship program that aims to teach children aged 11–12 the basics of business and entrepreneurship and to promote teamwork and leadership in the classroom. They find a positive effect on non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills. In contrast, Oosterbeek et al. (2010) show that an entrepreneurship education program had no effect on university students’ entrepreneurial skills and had a negative effect on the intention of becoming an entrepreneur. Elert et al. (2015) is a rare study looking at the long-term impact of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurship. They find that high-school entrepreneurial education has an effect on the probability of starting a firm in Sweden, though they do not analyze broader employment outcomes.====When modeling entry into entrepreneurship, researchers have distinguished between several stages such as latent, nascent and actual entrepreneurship (e.g., Blanchflower et al., 2001; Gries and Naudé, 2011). Latent entrepreneurship refers to an entrepreneurial spirit, having business ideas, or the declared preference for self-employment over wage employment. Nascent entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are actively trying to start a new business (Grilo and Thurik, 2005; Reynolds et al., 2004). Studies analyzing the effects of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial intentions have mostly focused on latent entrepreneurship. The lack of evidence on impacts on nascent or actual entrepreneurship upon graduation is at times justified by a potential “time lag” from intentions to actions (Souitaris et al., 2007). However, it is not clear how long the duration of that time lag may be. Gielnik et al. (2017) highlight variations in impacts over time in the two years after individuals participate in entrepreneurship training. Beiler (2017) analyzes the effect of economic conditions on entrepreneurship among college graduates. He finds that patterns of entry into entrepreneurship are largely explained by effects occurring during the first year after students’ graduation. Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether changes in short-term intentions are predictive of longer-term effects on nascent or actual entrepreneurship.====In addition to focusing mostly on entrepreneurial intentions or latent entrepreneurship, existing evidence on entrepreneurship education is often based on quasi-experimental methods.==== Meta-analyses have suggested that observational or quasi-experimental evaluations of entrepreneurship education programs tend to obtain larger estimates of program impacts than experimental studies (Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015; Martin et al., 2013), possibly as they do not address all potential sources of bias or challenges to internal validity.====The broader literature analyzing the impact of entrepreneurship-support interventions on labor market and firm outcomes has shown a wide variation in program effectiveness (for a review, see Cho and Honorati, 2014). Most studies on business training analyze whether the skills of existing entrepreneurs can be strengthened to improve their productivity (for a review, see McKenzie and Woodruff, 2014). Business training can affect enterprise owners’ practices, although effects on employment or productivity are more limited in general and for women in particular (Bruhn and Zia, 2013; Cirera and Qasim, 2014; De Mel et al., 2014; Drexler et al., 2014; Karlan and Valdivia, 2011; Klinger and Schündeln, 2011). Business training focusing on psychological dimensions such as personal initiative or problem-solving appears more effective than traditional business skill training (Campos et al., 2017). In contrast, fewer studies focus on whether business training can equip individuals with the skills required to enter self-employment, and whether these impacts are sustained in the medium to long-term. There are still relatively few experimental studies analyzing the impact of training programs beyond a three-year horizon, though the literature is growing (Alzúa et al., 2016; Attanasio et al., 2017; Ibarrarán et al., 2018; Kugler et al., 2015; Alfonsi et al., 2019; Crépon and Premand, 2019). The few studies that document impacts of (micro-) entrepreneurship support programs over time show variations depending on the time frame being considered (Fiala, 2018), including short-term impacts that do not last (Blattman et al., 2018). In addition, recent meta-analyses acknowledge the lack of evidence on active labor market programs for specific groups, such as young women, skilled youths, or growth-oriented entrepreneurs (Card et al., 2018; McKenzie, 2017a).====In this paper, we present new experimental evidence on the medium-term impacts of entrepreneurship education on labor-market outcomes. We analyze the timeline of impacts of an entrepreneurship education program for university students in Tunisia, including entry into self-employment and labor market outcomes up to four years after graduation. As such, we also study the duration of the potential time lag between entrepreneurial intentions and actions, and whether changes in short-term intentions lead to later changes in latent, nascent or actual entrepreneurship.====The paper complements earlier evidence presented in Premand et al. (2016), which focuses on the short-term impact of entrepreneurship education one year after students’ graduation. Short-term results showed that entrepreneurship education targeted to university students in Tunisia had small absolute impacts on entry into self-employment, with effects ranging from 1 to 4 percentage points. However, the employment rate among applicants remained unchanged. Findings on intermediary outcomes were consistent with the limited employment results: the program improved business skills but had mixed impacts on personality and entrepreneurial traits. Yet results also showed that participation in the entrepreneurship track heightened graduates’ aspirations toward the future. As such, short-term results raised the question of whether larger impacts could be expected in the medium to long-term.====The medium-term experimental evidence we present in this paper shows that the impacts of entrepreneurship education were short-lived. We find no sustained impacts on self-employment or employment outcomes four years after graduation. An analysis of students’ employment history and project realization process shows how the intervention temporarily affected nascent entrepreneurship: the treatment group had more business ideas, was more likely to try setting up a project and to succeed at some point as a result of trying more. However, most impacts are concentrated in the year after graduation and phase out after that. Consistent with these results, few lasting impacts are found on other intermediary outcomes conducive to entrepreneurship. Among the changes in skills that were observed in the short-term, only a small impact on business knowledge remains four years later. Business networks have not expanded and connections with private-sector entrepreneurs are not more likely. While treated youths are slightly more likely to know how to apply for credit, almost three out of four youths report access to credit as the main barrier to entrepreneurship. Overall, there are no sustained effects on latent entrepreneurship either. Most students who had business ideas have abandoned them and participants in the entrepreneurship training do not have more business ideas than the control group. The increased optimism observed one year after graduation was also short-lived. Finally, patterns of heterogeneity are weak, and the lack of medium-term impact holds across sub-groups defined based on gender, access to financing, skills or networks.====The paper is organized as follows.

It is supposed to increase fertility, promote children’s development and enhance mothers’ labor market attachment. In this paper, we analyze the causal effect of one of the largest expansions of subsidized childcare for children up to three years among industrialized countries on the employment of mothers in Germany. Identification is based on spatial and temporal variation in the expansion of publicly subsidized childcare triggered by two comprehensive childcare ==== in coming years.","In light of low fertility and female employment rates the provision of public childcare has been on the agenda of many countries (Immervoll and Barber, 2006). The expansion of public childcare is supposed to increase fertility, mothers’ labor market attachment, and promote childrens’ development in early life. Therefore, many countries have been increasing availability of public or publicly subsidized childcare, especially for children aged below three years. On average, OECD countries increased enrollment to formal childcare in this age group from 29 to 34 percent, i.e. by 5 percentage points, between 2006 and 2014====. In this time period, Germany is among the countries with the strongest increase in child care coverage: enrollment more than doubled from 14 to 32 percent over that time span.====A positive effect of public childcare on maternal employment can be rationalized within an economic model of the family (Blau, 2003). The implied decrease in costs of childcare changes the relative utilities of consumption and leisure. Yet, income effects, preferences for the quality of care, or the availability of alternative modes of childcare loosen this relationship. In particular, subsidized childcare may crowd-out private or informal care keeping maternal employment constant.====Given the theoretical ambiguity, an empirical literature on the employment effects of subsidized childcare has emerged. Evidence from early empirical studies based on cross-sectional variation or structural models unequivocally points to a significant impact of costs and availability of childcare on mothers’ labor supply (Anderson, Levine, 2000, Blau, Currie, 2006). More recent studies based on quasi-experimental variation induced by policy reforms, however, find mixed results. Although a majority of findings confirms the significant effect of the availability of public or subsidized childcare,==== several analyses report negligible or insignificant estimates.==== Moreover, effects are often found to be heterogeneous: the impact is larger for singles (compared to married mothers), women without additional young children (compared to mothers with multiple young children), for less educated mothers (compared to high-skilled women with lower elasticities), and it increases with the age of the youngest child.====In this study, we follow the quasi-experimental approach to identify potential effects of childcare availability on mothers’ labor supply. We exploit the variation across regions and over time in the supply of childcare that has been introduced by two comprehensive policy reforms in Germany from 2005 and 2008. Starting from very low levels, childcare coverage for children aged 0 to 3 in West Germany rose dramatically. In our observation period from 2007 to 2014, the provision of subsidized childcare increased from about 8% to more than 27%. We are thus able to work with a substantial increase in the provision of childcare and not only marginal changes in childcare costs. Peculiarities of the administrative process and frictions in the market for childcare led to regional variation over time. We argue that – conditional on covariates – this variation can be considered exogenous and used for identification. Exploiting this variation, we assess whether there is a causal link between the provision of publicly subsidized childcare and the labor supply of mothers with children aged 1 to 3 in West Germany.====In order to account for unobserved regional differences that might confound the causal relationship between the availability of childcare and mothers’ labor supply, we control for year and county fixed effects. The empirical analysis is based on eight waves of the German Microcensus. This data set does not contain information on the individual choice of a childcare arrangement. We can, however, estimate intention-to-treat effects (ITT) of the provision of public childcare on maternal labor supply. More specifically, we analyze whether the expansion of subsidized childcare has affected mothers’ labor force participation, part-time and full-time employment.====With this analysis we contribute to the literature in several ways: Our study quantifies the impact of the expansion in public childcare on maternal employment. In contrast to other studies that have analyzed similar childcare expansions in other countries, we not only look at effects on total labor market participation, but also on different types of employment. Moreover, our data set allows us to control not only for the increase in the total availability of childcare slots but also on the share of full-time slots. Finally, our analysis of heterogenous effects for different socio-economic subgroups adds to the literature on distributional consequences of public policies.====We find a statistically significant intention-to-treat effect of the expansion of subsidized childcare for children under the age of three on mothers’ labor supply. An increase in availability of subsidized childcare slots by one percentage point increases mothers’ participation rate by 0.2 percentage points, which translates to an elasticity of 0.04. This is slightly below the findings from an evaluation of a comparable policy reform in the 1990s that affected older children (Bauernschuster and Schlotter, 2015) but virtually identical to simulations results of the expansion of childcare for children aged 1–3 years based on a structural model estimated on data from 2001 to 2006 (Geyer et al., 2015). Estimates for different types of employment show that the increase in mothers’ employment that can be causally related to the expansion in childcare is almost entirely driven by part-time employment ranging from 20 to 35 h per week. Part-time employment up to 20 h per week or full-time employment rates have not changed due to the expansion of subsidized childcare. Full-time employment is also not affected by a rising share of full-time slots (i.e. childcare of more than 6 h per day). Differentiating by socio-economic groups, we find that neither high-skilled nor low-skilled mothers react to the reform. Mothers with medium skill levels (who make up about 60 percent of all mothers in our sample) are driving the aggregate effect.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly sketches theoretical predictions on the relationship between the availability of public childcare and mothers’ labor supply and gives an overview of the empirical literature. It also provides a detailed description of the childcare market and policy reforms in Germany. The data used for the empirical analysis are described in Section 3.

We consider a reform that increased the age threshold of this scheme from 55 to 57. Our estimates show that the reform increased employment over the remaining working career by seven months. Despite the corresponding reduction in unemployment, we find no evidence of significant effects on mortality or receipt of disability and sickness benefits, nor on spouse’s labor supply. The reform led to a fiscal impact of 15,000 Euros in increased net transfers paid by an average individual over the 10-year period.","In many European countries, longer entitlement periods of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are provided for older unemployed. These benefit extensions can contribute to high levels of unemployment in the oldest groups in two ways. First, employers tend to target dismissals at those employees who qualify for extended benefits. Some eligible workers may also leave their job voluntarily to obtain more leisure time if the benefit scheme is sufficiently generous. As a result, the older workers eligible for extended benefits have been found to enter unemployment at a high rate (Winter-Ebmer, 2003, Kyyrä, Wilke, 2007, Tuit, van Ours, 2010, and Baguelin and Remillon, 2014). Second, among unemployed workers eligibility for extended benefits discourages job search and thereby prolongs unemployment spells, and such benefits may be used to bridge the time until retirement (Hunt, 1995, Lalive, Zweimüller, 2004, Kyyrä, Ollikainen, 2008, Lalive, 2008, Tatsiramos, 2010, Baguelin, Remillon, 2014, Inderbitzin, Staubli, Zweimuller, 2016). While the effects of extended benefits on the unemployment inflow and the duration of unemployment spells are well documented, their long-term effects, fiscal impact and effects on health and spouse’s behavior have been studied less.====In this paper, we study a reform in 2005 that postponed access to extended UI benefits by two years from age 55 to 57 in Finland. The Finnish scheme is rather generous in the sense that the extended benefits can be received until retirement. We find that the two-year increase in the eligibility age increased employment by 7 months between the ages of 54 and 63 among private-sector workers. Despite a large reduction in the time spent in unemployment, we do not find evidence of long-term health effects as measured by the amount of medical expenditure, disability and sickness benefits received, or mortality by the end of 2015. Moreover, the spouse’s employment months and retirement age do not appear to be affected. As such, the only longer term effect seems to be higher employment for the group that was directly affected by the reform. This employment effect amounts to an increase of 22,000 Euros in wage income and a decrease of 11,000 Euros in unemployment-related benefits on average over the 10-year period. Higher earnings also reduce the need to rely on other benefits, such as housing allowance and social assistance, while increasing taxes and social security contributions paid to the society. Taking all benefits, income taxes and social security contributions into account, we estimate that the fiscal impact of the reform was around 15,000 Euros over the 10-year period for an average individual. This is a large effect given that the counterfactual level of average net transfers over the same period is about 26,000 Euros.====We reach these conclusions using a sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) and rich register data on all private-sector employees born in 1949 and 1950. The 2005 reform only affected individuals who were born in 1950 or later. As a result, the 1950 cohort became entitled to extended benefits at age 57, while the 1949 cohort became eligible at age 55. The reform provides an ideal setting for RDD analysis given that the individuals cannot manipulate their eligibility status, which is based on the birth date. We also show that the individuals on both sides of the cutoff are highly similar in observable characteristics, and therefore it is likely that they do not differ significantly in terms of unobservables either. Despite this homogeneity, those born in 1950 worked on average notably more than those born in 1949 over the 10-year period. The jump of 7 months at the cutoff value is quite large in relation to the two-year difference in the minimum eligibility age for extended benefits. This implies that the extended benefit scheme as a whole must have a large negative impact on employment of the oldest worker groups.====Our findings complement the previous studies on the effects of extended benefits by providing evidence on the full impact of the changes in employment months and earnings over the remaining working career. We also present novel evidence on the extent to which taxation and various income transfers counteract the earnings losses of the unemployed. The previous literature has not been able to assess fiscal impacts at such a detailed level. In addition, we contribute to the literature by examining broader impacts of extended benefits in terms of health, program substitution and spouse’s labor supply.====Some previous studies have found a positive association between unemployment and mortality (e.g. Eliason, Storrie, 2009, Sullivan, von Wachter, 2009) and unemployment and adverse health outcomes (e.g. Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2015, Schmitz, 2011). However, since extended UI benefits essentially secure the income for an unemployed person until retirement and can be regarded as an early retirement scheme, it may be that many of the negative effects of unemployment on an individual’s health are absent when extended benefits are available. This could explain why we find no change in mortality despite the large drop in unemployment months. Kuhn et al. (2018) study early retirement through an extended UI benefit scheme in Austria and find that retiring early does increase the risk of premature death for men but has no effect on women. Other studies provide mixed evidence on the effects of early retirement on health and mortality (e.g. Hernaes, Markussen, Piggott, Vestad, 2013, Hallberg, Johansson, Josephson, 2015, Bloemen, Hochguertel, Zweerink, 2017, Black, French, McCauley, Song, 2018, Fitzpatrick, Moore, 2018). Kuhn et al. (2018) argue that the differences in results from these studies can be due to differences in the health and socio-economic characteristics of the affected populations.====Unlike some other studies (e.g. Inderbitzin et al., 2016), we find no evidence of spillover effects on other benefit programs, such as sickness and disability benefit schemes. Furthermore, although several studies have found that the labor supply decisions of older couples are interrelated (e.g. Blau, 1998, Lalive, Parrotta, 2017, Michaud, 2003, Zweimuller et al., 1996), we find no effect on spouse’s behavior even though the extended benefits act as a pathway to early retirement for many unemployed workers. To the extent that the unemployed are not looking to retire through extended benefits and would rather return to employment, one would, of course, expect there to be differences compared to the setting in which both spouses’ decisions concern regular retirement.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we describe the unemployment-related benefits for older workers in Finland. Section 3 presents our research design and Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 presents some descriptive evidence. Section 6 reports our estimation results and in Section 7 we discuss the robustness of these results.

Endogeneity issues affecting the type of contract held by parents are dealt with by constructing an instrument based on regional, time and ==== variation in the amount of wage subsidies available to firms to convert fixed-term contracts into permanent ones in Spain. The findings suggest that children whose fathers are less job insecure are considerably more likely to graduate from compulsory education on time. They are also less likely to drop out of the ==== and be classified as Not in Education, Employment or Training at age sixteen. Employment protection reforms that liberalise the use of fixed-term contracts and do not take into account these negative externalities on other members of the household are therefore understating their overall cost.","Job insecurity has increased in most OECD countries in the aftermath of the Great Recession (OECD, 2016) and, as a consequence, so has the fear of losing one’s job.==== Job insecurity has been a defining feature of some European countries for several decades. After the reforms that took place in the Eighties as a way to introduce flexibility into the labour market, economies like Spain, France or Italy developed a dual labour market structure with two easily identifiable sets of workers. As opposed to workers with permanent (or open-ended) contracts, those with fixed-term (or temporary) contracts suffer greater exposure to the risk of job loss since the latter, by definition, have a predetermined expiration date. Moreover, further increases in job insecurity are likely in the current context of ‘uberisation’ of the economy and the appearance of zero-hour contracts. While some degree of flexibility is needed for firms to adjust to the economic cycle, job insecurity can be harmful to affected workers. In particular, fixed-term contracts have been shown to lead to lower wages, lower levels of job satisfaction, lower levels of physical and mental health and increased occupational mismatch, among other negative consequences.==== The negative consequences of job insecurity are likely to spill over onto other members of the household, in particular children. This paper analyses the intergenerational impact of job insecurity by investigating how the contractual arrangement of working parents affects children’s school related outcomes. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first article that tries to identify the causal effect of parental contractual form on children’s outcomes.====Some of the negative consequences of fixed-term contracts affect variables that are normally considered to be inputs affecting the production function of cognitive achievement. These include impacts on parental income, parental time investments and parent’s mental health. Lower levels of income associated with fixed-term contracts could affect the financial resources devoted to children’s education (Blau, 1999). Job insecurity could also be linked to a reduction of the time spent with children if job insecure parents need to devote a disproportionately higher amount of time to look for a more secure job (Becker, 1993). Additionally, it could be difficult to isolate children from the negative consequences on parent’s mental health that could be derived from insecure employment conditions.====The estimation of a causal relationship between parent’s contract type and child schooling outcomes faces two main obstacles. First, it is uncommon to find linked parent-child datasets with rich data of parental labour market characteristics and detailed school performance. To overcome this obstacle, I use data from the Spanish Labour Force Survey (LFS), that allows linking all members living in the same household at the time of the interview. Given that all members aged sixteen or higher reply to the individual questionnaire, I can construct broad variables measuring school related outcomes. In particular, the information in the Spanish LFS allows the researcher to measure whether an individual has finished compulsory education on time at age sixteen; whether the student is not observed in the education system once she has reached the legal age to drop out; and the even more pervasive outcome capturing whether the student is not in education, employment or training (NEET) at the age of sixteen. All these indicators make poor employment and earnings prospects more likely in the longer term, among other potentially negative consequences.====The second challenge to estimating a causal relationship between parent’s contract type and child related outcomes is related to the fact that the type of contract under which any of the parents is hired is likely correlated with unobserved parental and household characteristics that also affect schooling outcomes of the child.==== This paper uses exogenous variation in regional labour market policies in Spain to identify the causal effects of interest. As Dolado et al. (2002) put it, “if one looks for a country to test for the different effects of temporary work contracts on the labour market, Spain provides a fascinating case study”. After the 1984 liberalisation reform, the use of fixed-term contracts in Spain suffers a substantial increase. Fig. 1 shows that from the first year of data available in 1987, the fixed-term employment rate increases steadily from about 15% in 1987 to over 30% in the early 1990’s.====After this dramatic increase in fixed-term contracts, several national reforms in the 1990’s and early 2000’s tried to reverse the situation. From 1997, also some regional governments introduced different programs aiming to increase the fraction of permanent contracts. In practice, these programs consisted of introducing regional wage subsidies as a way to offer incentives to firms to convert fixed-term contracts into permanent contracts. Not all regional governments implemented them, and among the regional governments that designed subsidies to foster permanent employment, the amount of the subsidy varied between different demographic groups and across time. I adapt the strategy followed in Barceló and Villanueva (2016), who study the impact of contract type on household financial wealth, to construct an instrument for the contract type held by the father when the student is sixteen years old.==== In particular, the instrument is constructed using subsidy variation across region, gender, time and age of the worker at the time of hiring. First stage estimates suggest that the amount of regional subsidies available to convert fixed-term contracts into permanent contracts had a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of holding permanent contracts. A battery of robustness checks suggest that the instrument is strong for fathers, whereas it is rather weak when trying to predict maternal’s contract type. Therefore the analysis in this paper focuses mainly on the role of father’s contract type on school related outcomes of the child.====The results show that students whose fathers hold a permanent contract (as opposed to a temporary or fixed-term contract) are, on average, about 7.8 percentage points more likely to graduate on time. They are also less likely to drop out of education at age sixteen by about 2.5 percentage points, and there is suggestive evidence indicating that they are less likely to be classified as NEET by about 1.6 percentage points. These magnitudes are sizeable and represent, respectively, about 37%, 19% and 23% of the initial raw difference in these outcomes between individuals whose fathers have a permanent versus a fixed-term contract (and about 16%, 9% and 7.5% of the overall standard deviation of the outcome, respectively). Robustness checks show that the main results in this paper are not driven by parents with recent experiences of unemployment.====I explore potential mechanisms for the negative effects of father’s fixed-term contract. The results suggest that fathers with fixed-term contracts want to work more hours. Additionally, fathers on fixed-term contracts show significantly lower levels of job satisfaction in several aspects of their jobs; in particular with respect to satisfaction with job stability. Big differential effects in job satisfaction are likely to be felt at the household level. In fact, work in social psychology has shown that children as young as 5 years of age can develop clear perceptions of the world of work and parent’s job insecurity, and understand concepts such as pay, labor disputes, unemployment and welfare (Barling et al., 1999).====Temporality and unemployment spells are frequently alternated by job insecure workers. As a result, this paper is linked to the literature analysing the intergenerational effects of parental unemployment. A recent paper in this literature is the one by Pinger (2016), that finds that paternal unemployment has a considerable negative effect on the probability to complete upper secondary education. The impact of parental unemployment also seems to affect life satisfaction of children (Nikolova and Nikolaev, 2018). Workers with fixed-term contracts, in the absence of contract conversion, are faced with job loss at the termination date. Therefore, the results in the job loss literature are also relevant to this paper. Examples of negative impacts of parental job loss on school performance include Rege et al. (2011), who show negative impacts of parental job loss due to plant closure in Norway, and Ruiz-Valenzuela (2015) who shows negative effects of job losses stemming from the Great Recession in Spain.====Even if the effects reported in this paper might seem large, other papers in this related literature have also found rather large effects for the impact of paternal unemployment or paternal job loss on children’s outcomes. For instance, using data from Germany, Pinger (2016) finds that parental unemployment at the time of the upper secondary education decision reduces the probability of obtaining a higher education certificate by about one third. Another example in the job loss literature, by Rege et al. (2011), finds that paternal job loss has a negative effect on graduating secondary students’ school performance in Norway, reducing graduation-year GPA by about 6% of the standard deviation overall (11% of the standard deviation in municipalities with mediocre performing job markets).====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the Spanish labour market and the institutional framework in place during the eighties, nineties and early 2000’s. Section 3 describes the data, whereas Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. The main results, robustness checks and potential mechanisms are discussed in Section 5.

In some cases, this feedback informs students that they are performing below the acceptable academic standard expected by the institution and that failure to meet this standard in subsequent assessments will result in some action being taken against them. At other times, the institution may choose to celebrate, levy praise or publicly recognize the academic achievement of high-performing students. In both of these cases, the student receives a salient signal of the quality of their academic performance. This feedback changes the student’s default option by introducing a punishment they may face or a benefit they could lose in future periods (Baumeister et al., 1990). Many colleges employ these administrative policies to encourage student success and to align each student’s actions with the expectations of the institution.====Despite the high frequency with which students receive feedback about the quality of their performance, empirical evidence of their impact on students’ subsequent academic decisions and outcomes is relatively sparse in the literature. This is because it is difficult to empirically assess the impact of praise and reprimands in a non-experimental setting, owing to the differences between those who are exposed to the information and those who are not. Furthermore, quality data on the various performance feedback that postsecondary students receive and their academic records are not widely available. In this paper, I utilize rich administrative data from a large public university in Jamaica to estimate the causal impact of being recognized on the Dean’s list or put on academic probation on students’ subsequent academic decisions and outcomes.====The Dean’s list initiative is one medium that colleges utilize to recognize the academic performance of high-achieving students. The list is comprised of the names of students whose grade point average (GPA) exceeds some high-performance threshold. Eligible students may also receive a combination of public recognition, praise, and awards for achieving this accomplishment. This list is dynamically updated at a fixed time interval and new students who have passed this performance threshold are added, while others that have fallen below are dropped from the list. In contrast, the academic probation policy targets poor-performing students whose academic performances fall below some minimum GPA expected by the institution. Each student who satisfies this criterion receives a warning letter that explains that they have failed to meet the academic standard expected by the college. The letter also informs the student that if this poor performance is repeated in the following semester, they will be asked to withdraw from their studies. These policies provide each affected student with a signal about the quality of their academic performance and impose a cost on subsequent academic performance below the established GPA standard.====There are four main channels through which these policies can potentially impact a student’s subsequent behavior. First, since being treated imposes a cost on subsequent performance below the acceptable standards, affected students may be induced into increasing the level of effort they exert. The students who are affected by these policies enter a new state of nature where they are at risk of facing a penalty or losing an acquired (endowed) benefit. This may incentivize them to more closely align their actions with the institution’s preferences (Baumeister et al., 1990). Second, it is also plausible that these policies could inform students about their places in the GPA distribution and could cause students to update their priors about their academic ability (Weiner et al., 1972). Several studies show that students update beliefs about their academic ability while in college and make decisions about persisting logically. This shows that students behave like producers in evaluating their current performance and deciding how much effort to invest in subsequent periods (Elsner, Isphording, 2017, Lin, 2013, Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner). Third, when students receive positive or negative information about their academic performance, it may alter their self-image, confidence, and motivation. This argument has been made in the psychology literature, where it has been posited that goal-setting, personal expectation, and mental effort investment may be influenced by the perception of success or failure (Bénabou, Tirole, 2002, Feather, 1966, Seaver, Quarton, 1976, Venables, Fairclough, 2009). Similarly, Baumeister et al. (1990) found that praise may improve an individual’s subsequent performance on tasks that depend primarily on effort. Finally, these initiatives could have an impact on a student’s course selection strategy and persistence in their chosen major of study. Because these policies require that students exceed a set standard of academic performance, they may incentivize students to change their behavior along non-effort margins to achieve this objective.==== I also explore some of these behavioral changes in this paper.====This paper shares some similarity to the works of Lindo et al. (2010), Seaver and Quarton (1976) and Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). These studies are pioneering research on the impact of performance standards on students’ subsequent academic outcomes.==== While Lindo et al. (2010) focused on the consequences of being affected by academic probation, Seaver and Quarton (1976) and Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) examined the impact of public recognition on students’ subsequent attitudes and academic performances. Seaver and Quarton (1976) argued that Dean’s list recognition serves as a potentially powerful social reinforcer of the behaviors leading to academic achievement, and it should improve students’ self-esteem and expectations for future performance relative to others. Similarly, Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) found that there is a motivational effect of public recognition which improves students’ subsequent academic aspirations and outcomes. I contribute to this burgeoning literature in several ways. First, a novel feature of this paper is that it examines the impact of performance standards at both the top and bottom of the performance distribution for students from the same population, whereas existing studies tend to focus on one in isolation. Second, I examine the mechanism through which students adjust their behavior after being affected by either policy and assess the impact of each program on student success. Finally, this paper offers some insights into how the results may diverge when key institutional details - such as the generosity of the performance standard - are altered.====To causally identify the impact of each program, the regression discontinuity design is employed. This is done by exploiting the discontinuities in treatment eligibility that is created by institutional policies. In particular, the identifying assumption is that students who are immediately above the performance standard threshold for academic probation and were not eligible for receiving the warning letter have similar observed and unobserved characteristics as those who are just below the threshold and were treated by receiving the written reprimand. Similarly, causal identification requires that students who are narrowly ineligible for a spot on the Dean’s list provide a good counterfactual to students whose grade point averages (GPA) are just above the Dean’s list academic standard. While this assumption is usually violated by students’ manipulation of their eligibility for treatment, this is unlikely to be the case in this paper due to the policies governing students at the institution being examined.====I find that both policies have a positive effect on the academic performance of treated students in subsequent semesters. The results show that the students who are affected by the academic probation policy in their first semester have a higher likelihood of switching their major and college of study, though it did not induce them to voluntarily drop out of the institution. I also find similar results when the academic probation standard becomes more restrictive, increasing from a GPA of 1.00 to 2.00. The results further suggest that in responding to either policy, treated students are incentivized to engage in strategic course-taking behavior by choosing courses that are more generous along dimensions we would expect. However, I find no evidence that either policy harmed students’ long-term outcomes, such as their prospects for graduation. These results provide mixed support for existing findings in the literature and offer several insights on the mechanisms students utilize to meet these standards once they have been treated.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the data and institutional framework specific to the policies evaluated in this study. Section 3 describes the empirical model and the major assumptions of the regression discontinuity design, Section 4 presents the main results, and Section 5 provides the main concluding arguments.","Perform better, or else: Academic probation, public praise, and students decision-making",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119301095,5 November 2019,2019,Research Article,326.0

Using new Equifax data on employer credit checks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax data, and the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment data, we show that these bans shifted employment to people residing in census tracts with the lowest average risk score. We do this using both employment outcomes and changes in worker commuting patterns, which allow us to control for business cycle effects at very refined geographies. The largest shifts occurred in higher paying jobs and in the government sector. At the same time, using a large database of online job postings, we show that employers in low-credit municipalities subject to the ban differentially increased their demand for other signals of applicants’ job performance, like education and experience. On net, the changes induced by these bans generate relatively worse outcomes for those with mediocre risk scores, for those under 22 years of age, and for blacks—groups commonly thought to benefit from such ====, but which may suffer from statistical discrimination.","The use of credit information for employment screening has increased significantly over the last two decades (see Fig. 1), with industry surveys indicating use by approximately 47 percent of employers (Society for Human Resource Management 2012). This screening tool has come under fire, though, by politicians and community groups that claim it unfairly penalizes those who have suffered from unemployment, medical debt, family breakup, or “individual bad luck” (Traub 2016). Anti-screening activists further argue that there is no research linking credit history to job performance, credit reports often contain errors, and bankruptcy and other negative credit events are caused by outside events, not “over-consumption.”==== There is also concern that these checks might disproportionately affect minority applicants (Traub 2013). In response to these fears, a number of state governments have passed laws restricting the use of credit information by employers. The first of these laws was passed in Washington in 2007, and, as of this writing, 10 states and three municipalities have such laws on the books. Thirty-one other states have considered similar laws. This practice has come under scrutiny at the federal level as well. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recently noted in a discussion letter, “if an employer's use of credit information disproportionately excludes African-American and Hispanic candidates, the practice would be unlawful unless the employer could establish that the practice is needed.”====Although employer credit checks are now pervasive and state and local bans on the use of credit information have become increasingly popular, until recently little research has been done to date on their economic impact.==== In this paper, we explore this impact using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax. These data contain a five percent random sample that is representative of all individuals in the United States who have a credit history and whose credit file includes the individual's social security number. This large dataset allows us to measure properties of the Equifax Risk Score==== (subsequently referred to as “risk score”) distribution for extremely detailed geographies like census tracts. We pair this credit information with data on employment outcomes for these geographies from the LEHD Origin Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), described in Section 2 below. By comparing outcomes across tracts—and within residence tracts, across employment destinations—we are able to measure the relative impact of these laws on low-risk score populations.====We find, robustly, that these bans shifted employment to residents of low-credit score census tracts. Our baseline specifications indicate that low-credit score tract==== residents (for example, those with an average credit score below 620) saw employment increase by roughly 3.7–7.5 percent. The LODES data contain information on both the residence of the employees and the location of employment. The residence location-employer location nature of the LODES data enables us to cleanly identify this effect by exploiting variation ==== residents of a tract across employment locations with and without the bans. These shifts, in percentage terms, were in relatively higher-paying jobs. Across industries, employers in the public sector were most affected by these bans, followed by those in transportation and warehousing, and in-home services. This pattern makes sense, as both compliance and previous use of risk score information in hiring are likely to have been high in the public sector and in highly regulated industries, such as transportation and information, which often provide employees access to secure facilities, goods, customers’ residences, and private information. Employers failing to perform background checks in these industries could possibly be held legally liable for damage caused by the employee. Employment in construction and food services declined among residents of low-risk score tracts following these bans, as people shifted to better-paying jobs. As expected, employment in the financial sector, which is typically exempt from these bans, was unaffected by the introduction of these laws.====Although employment relatively increased for people living in the lowest-risk score tracts following a ban, we find that these relative increases were mirrored by relative employment declines for those living in mediocre risk score tracts (for example, those with average scores between 630 and 650). Using new data on 74 million online job postings collected by Burning Glass Technologies, we rationalize this finding by exploring employer experience and education requirements for new hires. A relatively larger fraction of jobs in low credit score areas began requiring college degrees and prior work experience following a ban on credit screening. This is important evidence of substitution across signals by employers. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of signal substitution in this context.====The elimination of a signal of worker quality also raises the possibility of increased statistical discrimination based on demographic characteristics. To explore the net impact of these bans on minority populations, we used data from the American Community Survey Integrated Public Use Micro Data. We compared labor market outcomes for blacks in states with and without bans, relative to prior trends and conditional on individual controls. We find that the introduction of a ban is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of being unemployed for prime-age blacks compared with the contemporaneous change for whites. Thus, it appears that the prohibition of credit screening and the increased emphasis on other signals may actually, relatively, ==== minority applicants.====This paper contributes to an important empirical literature on signals in employer screening. Several studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Kroft et al., 2013; Correll et al., 2007) have demonstrated the importance of implicit signals like race, work history, and family status, in experimental contexts. Fewer studies have looked at the availability of such signals and their equilibrium effects in a non-experimental context. Seminal papers in that vein include Autor and Scarborough (2008) and Wozniak (2015). Both papers demonstrate that some signals that seem to penalize minority applicants—a retail personality quiz and drug screening, respectively—actually may not do so in equilibrium. Relatedly, Holzer et al. (2006) shows that employers who check criminal records are more likely to hire blacks, although Finlay (2009) finds that people without criminal records from high-incarceration demographic groups do not have better labor market outcomes with increased testing. Adams (2004) provides evidence that legislation prohibiting the use of age by employers raises employment for older workers, and Goldin and Rouse (2000) shows that eliminating gender signals increases employment for women among musicians.==== Finally, Modestino et al. (2015a, 2015b) show, using similar job vacancy data from Burning Glass Technologies, that employer demands for signals like education and experience are sensitive to labor market conditions.====Very recently, there have been several papers exploring the relationship between the existence of credit score information and employment generally. Bos et al. (2016) look at the effect of a Swedish law that removed negative credit information from some reports and found significant employment increases. Conversely, Dobbie et al. (2016) and Herkenhoff et al. (2016) find that removal of bankruptcy flags in credit reports – which occur after seven years for Chapter 13 filers and ten years for Chapter 7 filers – has small employment effects. This is perhaps not surprising, given the relatively minor impact of the flag's removal on credit scores themselves (approximately 10 to 15 points on average) documented by Dobbie et al. (2016). These studies explore the impact of the existence of this specific type of older credit information for all context (including borrowing), not just its availability to employers.====Additionally, there are a handful of contemporaneous papers that look employer credit check bans in standard microdata series. Fredberg et al. (2016) use the SIPP to look at the impact of employer credit check bans for those who report having difficulty paying their bills. They find increases in the job finding hazard, though they detect no impact on minority groups (perhaps due to sample size issues). Bartik and Nelson (2016) use CPS data and find that bans are associated with reduced job finding rates for Blacks using a difference-in-differences approach.====Relative to this literature, our paper makes three central contributions. First, it uses a rich and novel data set allows us to provide a highly robust and cleanly identified estimate of the impact of an economically important screening ban on employment outcomes. The identification does not rely on a single aspect of one's credit report, such as an older bankruptcy flag, or on indirect proxies such as race. Second, the paper provides some of the first evidence of large-scale ==== by employers and confirms that this substitution has disparate impact across demographic groups. This analysis provides some of the first real world evidence of this phenomenon.==== Lastly, the paper provides an empirical framework for convincingly identifying the impact of state and local labor laws that target attributes that cannot be easily linked at the individual level, like risk scores. Many labor market laws—like those dealing with undocumented workers or those dealing with mental health issues—fall into this category, and the worker location-employer location identification framework described here has the potential to be useful in these situations.====Our paper also contributes to a growing literature on credit scores themselves, the information they contain, and their potential racial bias. Iyer et al. (2015) shows that credit score information is correlated with non-quantifiable signals of borrower quality, including appearance. Cohen Cole (2011) shows that lenders treat credit scores differently in heavily black areas. Finally, several papers have shown that while credit scores differ across racial groups, these scores nevertheless contain information about creditworthiness not captured by demographic characteristics. (Avery et al., 2012; Board of Governors, 2007).====It is important to note that this paper estimates employment gains for residents of low credit score tracts relative to those living in mid- and high-score tracts. Our specification are designed to measure these relative effects within small geographies. In the paper, we interpret these relative gains as reflecting shifts in which workers get jobs, not overall increases, and our language reflects that. Our interpretation stems from the findings, reported in Appendix Table 3, of small and insignificant effects of an un-interacted dummy for a credit check law in a standard cross-state differences-in-differences specification in our data.====We do not presume that there are no general equilibrium effects. Cotes et al. (2018) find that aggregate job vacancies decline following a credit check ban. This impact can be rationalized in a model with employer screening and risky credit, such as the one constructed by Corbae and Glover (2018). That paper summarizes the model by saying “a policy banning pre-employment credit screening… has both direct and indirect effects on the equilibrium. First, as expected by policy markets, there is a redistribution of wages from high to low credit score workers…. However, there is also an indirect effect on the equilibrium that lowers welfare for everyone.” Thee exercise here, we believe, is best reflective of the redistribution channel discussed above, and is not well suited to measure the broader general equilibrium mechanisms.====Further, credit check bans may affect firm decisions beyond the decision whom to hire. In principle, these bans may also affect the location in which firms operate as well as the absolute number of employees hired. We explore the possibility of firm relocation in appendix Tables 3 and 6 and conclude these effects are small. Some industries may respond differently, though, and this heterogeneity may be an are====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the Consumer Credit Panel, LODES, and Burning Glass data, along with summary statistics on tract-level outcomes. It also briefly describes the theoretical framework underlying our empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the central identification strategies and estimates the baseline relationship between credit bans and employment in low-risk score tracts. Section 4 explores the impact of these bans on outcomes by industry and wage range. Using the Burning Glass data, Section 5 introduces estimates that assess the impact of bans on education and experience requirements.

We find that a one-decile increase in the within-school-cohort age distribution decreases the probability of being victimized by about one percentage point. Age rank effects are stronger when calculated within groups defined by observable characteristics.","School violence, as well as more general forms of misbehaviour at school, are a widespread phenomenon that is increasingly capturing the attention of policy-makers, administrators, teachers, and parents. In 2015, across the OECD countries participating in the ==== (PISA), almost 20% of 15-year-old students reported being victim of some form of bullying on a monthly basis, and almost 50% reported having being victimized at least a few times per year (OECD, 2017). In Italy about 50% of adolescents aged between 11 and 17 reported having been victim of some form of violent or disrespectful behaviour in 2014 (ISTAT, 2015).====Being bullied has been found to have both short- and long-run consequences, not only on mental and physical well-being, but also on educational choices and labour market outcomes (Ammermüller, 2012, Bowes, Joinson, Wolke, Lewis, 2015, Eriksen, Nielsen, Simonsen, 2014, Kim, Leventhal, 2008, Ponzo, 2013). In order to design effective policies to combat bullying, it is important to gather robust evidence on its determinants. In a school context, age is likely to be an important factor: being related to the physical and psychological development of children, it can shape social hierarchies at school and be at the basis of the imbalance of power that intrinsically characterises the relationship between bullies and their victims (Olweus, 2013). Age is also especially interesting to look at from a policy perspective, because it is easily observable, and school principals can take it into account when deciding on school admission or class formation.====We are not the first to study the link between age and bullying. The occurrence of bullying episodes, in particular of physical bullying, is well known to decline with age (Brame, Nagin, Tremblay, 2001, Smith, Madsen, Moody, 1999). Mühlenweg (2010) finds that higher relative age (measured as the deviation from the mean age within grade) decreases the chances of being bullied in 4==== grade. On the other hand, Ammermüller (2012) does not find age to be a significant determinant of school victimisation in 4==== or 8==== grade.====In this paper we investigate how the position of a student in the school-level age distribution (hereafter simply referred to as ====) affects the probability of being bullied at school, using data on the universe of Italian students enrolled in 5==== and 6==== grade in three different school years. Contrary to previous papers in the literature, we are the first to look at an ordinal, rather than a cardinal, measure of relative age. This is important because age rank effects have very different policy implications than those stemming from differences in absolute age or in (cardinal) relative age.==== By their very nature, rank effects cannot be prevented by simple traditional policies aimed at manipulating the age composition within a given school or class, as there will always be some student at the bottom of the age distribution. The mere awareness of the existence of age rank effects can help setting more realistic expectations on the degree to which a whole class of age-related policies can reduce bullying, and can help policy makers and practitioners to better design and implement a different set of targeted policies or interventions aimed at preventing bullying and at providing support to the most vulnerable students.====We achieve identification by including school-by-cohort fixed effects, which allow us to compare students that have the same absolute age and the same distance from the mean age of their school cohort, but result in different ordinal positions because of differences in the shape of the respective school-cohort age distributions (Elsner, Isphording, 2017, Elsner, Isphording, 2018, Murphy, Weinhardt, 2018). This means that the age rank effect we estimate operates on top of the effects of absolute and relative age estimated by the previous literature. We deal with the potentially endogenous sorting of students into different school-entry cohorts through an IV strategy based on the discontinuity in the probability of enrolling in a given school year generated by an end-of-year cut-off rule.====To our knowledge, we are the first to estimate an age rank effect. The previous literature on age effects has mostly focused on estimating the effect of absolute and (cardinal) relative age, showing that they both affect a variety of cognitive (Bedard, Dhuey, 2006, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2011, Cascio, Schanzenbach, 2016, Crawford, Dearden, Meghir, 2010, Elder, Lubotsky, 2009, Leuven, Rønning, 2016) and non-cognitive outcomes (Crafword, Dearden, Greaves, 2015, Lubotsky, Kaestner, 2016, Mühlenweg, Blomeyer, Stichnoth, Laucht, 2012). We also contribute to a small but rapidly growing literature on rank effects in education, which has so far focused on the rank of students in the test scores distribution (Bertoni, Nisticò, 2018, Comi, Origo, Pagani, 2018, Elsner, Isphording, 2017, Elsner, Isphording, 2018, Murphy, Weinhardt, 2018, Tincani, 2017).====In our preferred specification, a one-decile increase in the age rank is estimated to decrease the probability of being bullied by 1.3 percentage points in both grades, against a baseline probability of about 22% for 5th graders and 14% for 6==== graders. The effect is much higher (about the double in size) when the rank is computed with respect to the group-specific age distribution (where groups are defined in terms of socio-demographic characteristics such as gender and socio-economic status; we label these estimates ====). This suggests that students’ interactions tend to take place within homogeneous groups, defined by salient observable characteristics. Conversely, the ====, which we define as the effect of the (overall) age rank for students belonging to specific groups, are much more similar in magnitude than the baseline estimates. Both the within- and the between-group estimates indicate that male students are the group most vulnerable to age rank effects.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Standard data sources lack information on grandparents’ countries of birth, however, which creates potentially serious issues for tracking the progress of later-generation Mexican Americans. Exploiting unique NLSY97 data that address these ====, we find substantial educational progress between the 2nd and 3rd generations for a recent cohort of Mexican Americans. Such progress is obscured when we instead mimic the limitations inherent in standard data sources. Similar patterns emerge for cognitive test scores and for annual earnings.","Understanding the progress that takes place across immigrant generations is crucial for assessing the long-term impact of immigration on society. In many respects, 2nd-generation immigrants—the U.S.-born children of foreign-born migrants to the United States—show signs of rapid integration. On average, the 2nd generation as a whole and 2nd-generation members from most contemporary national origin groups meet or exceed the schooling level of the typical American (Duncan and Trejo 2018). Not conforming to this pattern, however, are Mexican Americans, who because of historical continuity and demographic size constitute arguably the most significant U.S. immigrant flow.====Panel A of Table 1 illustrates the seemingly persistent educational disadvantage of Mexican Americans. These calculations of average years of schooling for men use 2003–2016 data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).==== Mexican Americans display impressive growth in educational attainment between the 1st generation (9.5 years) and the 2nd generation (12.7 years), but no further improvement is evident for the 3rd+ generation (the grandchildren and later descendants of Mexican immigrants). As a result, even when the comparisons are confined to individuals whose families have lived in the United States for at least a couple of generations (i.e., the 3rd+-generation), Mexican Americans possess schooling deficits of more than a year relative to non-Hispanic whites and almost one-third of a year relative to African Americans.====Considering the low levels of schooling, English proficiency, and other types of human capital brought to the United States by the typical Mexican immigrant, it is not surprising that their U.S.-born children do not eliminate all of these enormous socioeconomic deficits in a single generation (Perlmann 2005; Smith 2006). Of potentially greater concern, however, is the evidence that progress seems to stall after the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans.==== Certainly, Mexican immigrants to the United States confront obstacles that might account for slowed or stalled progress among later generations (Portes and Rumbaut 2001), including discrimination (Telles and Ortiz 2008) and widespread undocumented status (Bean et al. 2011).====In addition, Huntington (2004) points to several other factors that could slow the pace of generational integration by Hispanics today as compared to Europeans in the past. These factors include the large scale of current immigration flows from Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, the substantial (though lessening) geographic concentration of these flows within the United States, and the fact that such flows have remained sizeable over a much longer period of time than did the influx from any particular European country. In addition, the close proximity of Mexico to the United States facilitates return and repeat migration. These unique features of Hispanic immigration might foster the growth of ethnic enclaves in the United States where immigrants and their descendants could, if they so choose, live and work without being forced to learn English or to Americanize in other important ways.==== Because of these and other concerns, Mexican Americans’ prospects for future upward mobility are subject to much recent debate.====In evaluating such theoretical arguments for slower integration by Mexican Americans, however, it is important to consider several potentially serious limitations of the existing empirical evidence. We consider, in turn, the following three measurement issues: (1) comparisons of immigrant generations in cross-sectional data, (2) ethnic attrition, and (3) the inability to distinguish the 3rd generation from higher generations.====First, as noted by Borjas (1993, 2006) and Smith (2003, 2006), generational comparisons in a single cross-section of data—like those reported in Panel A of Table 1—can be misleading because they do a poor job of matching parents and grandparents in an earlier generation with their actual descendants in later generations. If we assume that schooling is essentially complete by the age of 25 and changes little thereafter, we can use CPS data to conduct an analysis of generational changes in educational attainment similar in spirit to Smith (2003). Panel B of Table 1 reports the relevant calculations. This panel presents average schooling levels for Mexican Americans similar to those displayed in Panel A, except that now separate calculations are reported for two particular age groups: 25–34 and 50–59. By choosing age groups 25 years apart, we create a situation in which the older age group from a particular generation potentially represents the parental cohort for the younger age group in the next generation. For example, the cohort of 1st-generation men aged 50–59 includes fathers of the 2nd-generation cohort of sons aged 25–34.====Panel B reveals only slightly more progress beyond the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans than did Panel A. When we compare age/generation groups that potentially match Mexican-American fathers with their sons (by moving northeast between the connected cells with similar shading in Panel B), average schooling rises from 12.6 years for the older 2nd generation to 12.7 years for the younger 3rd+ generation, a positive but small gain.==== Therefore, the evidence of educational stagnation for later-generation Mexican Americans does not seem to derive largely from biases associated with comparing immigrant generations in a cross-section. Further, note in Panel B that young 3rd+-generation Mexican Americans continue to trail the average schooling of their non-Hispanic white and African-American peers by the same substantial amounts observed in Panel A.====Potential measurement bias arising from “ethnic attrition” is a second issue that might make it difficult to track progress across immigrant generations. In Table 1, 1st- and 2nd-generation Mexican Americans are identified using the relatively “objective” information collected by the CPS on the countries of birth of the respondent and his parents (e.g., a 2nd-generation Mexican American is a U.S.-born individual with at least one parent born in Mexico). Virtually no large, nationally-representative data sets, however, provide information on the countries of birth of an adult respondent's grandparents. As a result, 3rd-and-higher-generation Mexican Americans (or the so-called 3rd+ generation) must be assigned using more “subjective” measures of racial/ethnic identification. In Table 1, we follow standard practice in defining 3rd+-generation Mexican Americans as those who are U.S.-born, have two U.S.-born parents, and identify as “Mexican” or “Mexican American” in response to the Hispanic origin question. Given data limitations, researchers seeking to study later-generation Mexican Americans seldom have a better option. Nevertheless, the problem with using subjective measures of racial/ethnic identification is that assimilation and intermarriage can cause ethnic attachments to fade across generations (Alba 1990; Waters 1990; Perlmann and Waters 2007). Consequently, subjective measures of racial/ethnic identification might miss a significant portion of the later-generation descendants of immigrants. Furthermore, if such ethnic attrition is selective on socioeconomic attainment, then it can distort assessments of integration and generational progress. For Mexican Americans, Duncan and Trejo (2007, 2011, 2017) provide evidence that ethnic attrition is substantial and could produce significant downward bias in standard measures of attainment for later generations. In this way, measurement biases generated by ethnic attrition could create a misleading appearance of socioeconomic stagnation after the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans, similar to what is observed in Table 1.====A third but related measurement issue is that the data limitations just described also imply that, for adults, researchers typically cannot distinguish the “true” 3rd generation from higher generations. For this reason, Table 1 and the discussion so far refer to the “3rd+” generation. This is potentially a problem because Mexican Americans in generations beyond the 3rd are disproportionately descended from ancestors who came of age in places (e.g., Texas rather than California) and times (e.g., before the Civil Rights era) where Mexican Americans faced discrimination that was more severe and often institutionalized (Foley 1997; Alba 2006; Montejano 1987). The more limited opportunities for advancement experienced by these families may result in lower attainment for Mexican Americans in the 4th and higher generations compared with their 3rd-generation counterparts whose families experienced less hostile environments. Alba et al. (2011) and Bean et al. (2015) provide evidence of this pattern for schooling levels, highlighting the importance of distinguishing 3rd-generation Mexican Americans from higher generations. Kosack and Ward (2018) report much slower socioeconomic progress for Mexican Americans across immigrant generations before 1940 than afterward, and for the pre-1940 period they find that Mexicans Americans are particularly disadvantaged in Texas compared with California or U.S. states that do not border Mexico.====In the current paper, we exploit previously untapped information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) that allows us to address the last two measurement issues just discussed: ethnic attrition and distinguishing the 3rd generation from higher generations. For our purposes, a key feature of the NLSY97 is that it reports the countries of birth of respondents’ grandparents. This means that we can minimize ethnic attrition by identifying 3rd-generation Mexican Americans using ancestors’ countries of birth rather than subjective ethnic identification. It also means that we can distinguish 3rd-generation Mexican Americans from higher generations.====We use these data to analyze educational progress between 2nd- and 3rd-generation Mexican Americans. Once we address the measurement issues just described, we find a substantial increase in educational attainment between these generations. Moreover, we show that such progress is largely hidden when we mimic standard data sets and aggregate the 3rd and higher generations into a “3rd+” generation. Similar patterns emerge for cognitive test scores and for annual earnings. Our analysis thus provides promising evidence of generational progress for a recent cohort of Mexican-Americans. Indeed, for this birth cohort, the high school graduation rate of 3rd-generation Mexican Americans is only slightly below that of non-Hispanic whites from the 4th and higher generations.====Our paper relates most closely to two important recent studies of Mexican Americans that, through ambitious data collection efforts for specific locations, are also able to distinguish the 3rd generation from higher generations and, at least in part, account for ethnic attrition. Starting with a survey conducted in 1965 of Mexican-American families living in Los Angeles and San Antonio, Telles and Ortiz (2008) re-interview in 2000 available original respondents and their U.S.-born children. They find little evidence of educational or earnings progress beyond the 2nd generation. Bean et al. (2015) rely on survey information collected from multiple generations of Mexican-origin individuals living in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2004. Their analysis does suggest significant schooling and earnings gains for Mexican Americans between the 2nd and 3rd generations.====Our analysis contributes in several important ways to the ongoing scholarly debate over Mexican-American progress after the 2nd generation. First, we employ nationally-representative data from the NLSY97. In this way, we avoid issues of selective geographic mobility that can make it difficult to interpret results from studies of particular locations (Alba et al., 2014). Second, we are in a better position to assess and account for the effects of ethnic attrition, because roughly half of our Mexican-American respondents come from a sampling design that did ==== screen on race or ethnicity. In contrast, most of the original 1965 respondents in Telles and Ortiz (2008) and the Mexican-origin respondents in Bean et al. (2015) had to subjectively identify as being of Mexican descent to be included in these surveys. Third, in addition to examining the educational and labor market outcomes that have been studied previously, we also analyze a commonly-used measure of cognitive ability. Finally, the recency and youth of our sample—described in greater detail below—imply that our analyses provide better information about the future trajectories of U.S.-born Mexican Americans than previous work could.",New evidence of generational progress for Mexican Americans,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537119301071,19 October 2019,2019,Research Article,329.0

Hence, government employment and wage policies are driven by other objectives including: attaining budgetary targets (Gyourko, Tracy, 1989, Poterba, Rueben, 1998); implementing macroeconomic stabilization policy (Holm-Hadulla, Kamath, Lamo, Pérez, Schuknecht, 2010, Keynes, 1936, Lamo, Pérez, Schuknecht, 2013); redistributing resources (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 2000, Alesina, Danninger, Rostagno, 1999, Wilson, 1982); or satisfying interest groups for electoral gains (Borjas, 1984, Gelb, Knight, Sabot, 1991, Matschke, 2003). As a consequence, public-sector labour markets might behave differently from their private-sector counterparts.====The objective of this paper is to establish a number of key facts about the French, Spanish, UK and US labour market flows, focussing on the role played by the public sector. We do so by examining data from the French, Spanish and UK ==== and the US ==== (CPS) over the past 15 years. We chose these four countries because they are large countries with sizable public sectors, and have been recently facing pressure to reform their public sectors. Furthermore, because they have different labour market institutions, public-sector hiring procedures and wage policies and various weights on different industries, facts that are found to be common across the four countries should be seen as intrinsic characteristics of the public sector. While we do not attempt to explain these facts, we believe that they are an important first step to foster theoretical research on the topic. They can help economists understand the characteristics of the public sector and its policies, as well as provide a guideline of the empirical features that models with a public sector should reproduce and help in the calibration or identification of key parameters. We show that public-sector labour markets do indeed behave differently than the private sector. The size of transition rates into and out of public-sector employment are different and its cyclical pattern as well. Furthermore, the government hires mostly women, college graduates and older workers, which creates asymmetric exposures to public-sector policies for different workers.====In the last decade in European countries, public-sector employment was a key policy variable. Following budgetary constraints, many countries imposed measures such as hiring freezes layoffs of public-sector workers, as well as wage cuts or freezes that affected the retention of these workers (Glassner and Watt, 2010). Given the policy role that public-sector employment played during the last decade, a new wave of research constructs search and matching models of unemployment to study the labour market effects of public-sector employment and wages. Examples include Hörner et al. (2007), Quadrini and Trigari (2007), Afonso and Gomes (2014), Gomes, 2015b, Gomes, 2018, Michaillat (2014), Burdett (2012), Bradley et al. (2017), Albrecht et al. (2019), Bermperoglou et al. (2017) and Boeing-Reicher and Caponi (2017). Lying at the heart of these state-of-the-art models are the worker gross flows between private- and public-sector employment and non-employment.====However, the extensive literature that estimates and analyses worker gross flows has systematic ignored the role of the public sector. This literature has focused mainly on disentangling the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates in driving the unemployment rate. The most cited papers on the topic – Blanchard and Diamond (1990), Shimer (2012), Elsby et al. (2009) and Fujita and Ramey (2009) – study the US labour market, proposing different decompositions or examining the role of the time-aggregation bias. Also for the US, Borowczyk-Martins and Lalé (2019) distinguish between full-time and part-time employment, while Elsby et al. (2015) study the role of the participation margin. Smith (2011) proposes an out-of-steady-state decomposition and analyses the UK labour market. Gomes (2012) further analyses the UK labour market along other dimensions, such as education or labour force attachment, while Fujita (2010) concentrates on on-the-job search and job-to-job transitions and Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2016) on the extent of worker reallocation across occupations and industries and their cyclicality. In two comparisons of the UK and the US, Razzu and Singleton (2016) study the fluctuations of unemployment among men and women, while Gomes (2015a) examines the role of conditional transition probabilities and how they depend on the frequency of the surveys. Other papers focussing on the UK include Elsby et al. (2011) and Elsby and Smith (2010).====Several studies examine other European labour markets. Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008) compare the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates across France, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States. Silva and Vázquez-Grenno (2013) focus on the role of flows in and out of permanent and temporary employment in Spain. Baussola and Mussida (2014) study Italian gross flows, concentrating on unemployment gender gaps. Charlot et al. (2018) split between employment in abstract, routine and manual occupations in France and the US. Other works examining the French labour market include Hairault et al. (2015) and Fontaine (2016). Hertweck and Sigrist (2015) study the German labour market and Daouli et al. (2015) the Greek labour market during the crisis. Despite looking at worker flows from different angles, all the papers in this exhaustive list have ignored the duality between the private and the public sectors.====In Section 3, we provide evidence on the size and cyclicality of the flows between public and private employment, unemployment and inactivity. France and the UK have larger public sectors than either Spain or the US. Over the last business cycle, public-sector employment was pro-cyclical in France, countercyclical in the US, and acyclical in Spain and the UK.====In Section 4, we quantify how government hiring and separations have contributed to unemployment fluctuations. We show that ignoring these flows in unemployment decompositions can potentially bias the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates, although in our sample, this bias turned out to be small. We find a relative split of 80-20 percent of the contribution of private- and public-sector employment to fluctuations in the unemployment rate in UK, 85-15 in France and of 90-10 percent in Spain and the US. We performed a counterfactual analysis and show that since 2008, if governments had kept the same hirings and separations from the previous years, unemployment rate would have been lower, by up to 1 percentage point, in the France and the UK, but it would have been higher in the US and Spain. In our view, this finding reflects the different macroeconomic policies conducted by governments in response to the Great Recession, with a larger focus on austerity policies by some European countries.====We document that jobs are safer in the public sector – aggregate job-separation rates are lower. In Section 5, we further investigate this result by using a multinomial logit model to estimate the differences in transition rates from employment to unemployment and inactivity from the two sectors, conditional on observable characteristics. The argument that public-sector jobs are safer is often used in policy discussions surrounding public-sector pay. However, while there are several papers estimating the wage differentials across sectors, there are no estimates of the value of the job-security.==== We use a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to find the percentage of their wage that private-sector workers would be willing to forgo to have the same job-separation probability as in the public sector. In our preferred scenario, risk-neutral workers would pay 0.5 to 1.6 percent of their wage for the same job security, which can be seen as a lower bound for the insurance value of public-sector employment. Risk-averse workers without any savings mechanism would pay 1.0 to 2.9 percent of their wage, which can be seen as an upper bound. The value of job safety in the public sector is equivalent to between 0.4 to 0.7 percent of total government spending in France and between 0.2 to 0.4 percent in the UK, Spain and the US.",Labour market flows: Accounting for the public sector,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753711930106X,18 October 2019,2019,Research Article,330.0

In the paper, we summarize the selection of articles published in the Special Issue and place their contributions in the context of the main developments in this field. We have organized the articles into three broad thematic areas. The first set of papers provides novel evidence on migrant selection. The following group of articles delves into the core literature of the labour market impacts of immigration, with a particular focus on high-skilled immigration and selective immigration policies. A final group of papers deals with more specific - and often controversial – topics: refugee migration, undocumented migration and the political consequences of migrant flows. In the concluding remarks, we extract from the different papers some guidance for future migration policies.","The total number of international migrants in the world reached 272 million in 2019 (3.4% of the global population), an increase of 51 million since 2010. About half of the migrants reside in just 10 countries, and one third of them come from only 10 countries of origin. The United States alone host almost 19% percent of the total migrant population (roughly 51 million individuals in 2019), and the Mexico-U.S. corridor – with nearly 12 million Mexican migrants residing in the U.S. – is the largest one in the world. The number of immigrants residing in Europe is about 82 million, approximately 30% of the world migrant population, with the majority of them (about 50 million) living in the EU14+UK area (see United Nations, 2019). While declining fertility in Mexico and other Latin American countries, coupled with a relative improvement in their political and economic situation, is expected to gradually ease the migratory pressure towards the United States, the opposite is true for European countries, which are closely exposed to countries in Africa and the Middle East, which still display high levels of both fertility and instability (Hanson and McIntosh, 2016).====These expected upward trends in international migration clash with widespread hostility towards further increases of the immigrant population in major receiving countries (Pew Research Centre, 2018). Not only citizens in host societies systematically exaggerate the share of foreign-born individuals among the total resident population, but they also tend to underestimate migrants’ educational levels and socio-economic integration, while amplifying their cultural and religious differences (Alesina, Miano, and Stancheva, 2019). These biased perceptions suggests that providing more accurate information may possibly reduce hostility towards migrants (Grigorieff, Roth, and Ubfal, 2020). These tensions are at the very core of the present migration policy-making.====Receiving countries typically aim at regulating migrant flows through their migration policies. They intend to control both the size of the inflow and its characteristics, trying to select the best talents as well as catering to the needs of their labour markets. In recent years, an increasing number of countries (e.g. Canada, Australia, the U.S., and the U.K.) have implemented selective policies, whichseek to encourage immigration of specific workers, mostly highly qualified, to cover the high demand of specialists in certain occupations, which is driven by skill-biased technological change. The outcome of these selective policies – and their overall effectiveness in screening migrants– crucially depends on their design and on their interplay with the spontaneous selection of individuals into migration from origin countries.====Migration flows are also driven by supply shifts. Phenomena like refugee and undocumented migrations emphasize that migratory movements can happen despite the efforts of destination countries to influence them through their migration policies. Between 2015 and 2016, for instance, Europe experienced a “refugee crisis”, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries, reaching European countries to seek humanitarian protection from political persecution, war, and violence. As a result, a number of European countries have experienced yearly increases of their immigrant shares in the range of one percentage point. The ongoing refugee crisis in Venezuela, with over 5.2 million Venezuelan citizens having fled to neighbouring countries, has further contributed to the increase of the global population of forcibly displaced people, which reached a record number of 79.5 million in 2019. Undocumented migration is also a sizeable phenomenon, with the most recent estimates pointing at 4-5 million undocumented immigrants living in Europe (12-16% of the total Extra-EU immigrant population) and 10.5 million in the U.S. (23% of the foreign born population) (Pew Research Centre, 2019a, Pew Research Centre 2019b). Overall, the sizeable increases in economic and refugee migrants over the past decade seem to have generated a rise in xenophobic movements and nationalism around the world. These movements have been fuelled by aggressive political campaigns – such as those that led to the Brexit referendum in the UK or to the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the U.S. – that openly appealed to anti-immigration sentiments.====These facts highlight the importance of having a good understanding of the causes and consequences of international migration, and of the effects of different migration policies. A large literature has analysed many of these issues (see Hanson, 2009; Kerr and Kerr, 2011; Nathan, 2014; Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016; Peri, 2016; and Blau and Hunt, 2019 for recent surveys). In many instances, however, the literature has failed to reach a clear consensus. The contradicting nature of many of the findings in these studies reflects the intrinsic difficulties in implementing rigorous evaluations of the impact of migration. The main difficulties reside in the aggregate nature of migrant shocks, which prevents a straightforward identification of affected and unaffected individuals, and in the endogenous selection of migrants into countries, regions, sectors, etc., which complicates the estimation of their causal impact on receiving societies. Economists have tried to overcome these difficulties by implementing a large variety of approaches, ranging from natural experiments and instrumental variables to structural models. While allowing to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon, the heterogeneity in approaches has also raised issues of comparability of alternative findings. The literature on the economics of migration is rich and booming, but it is not settled yet. There are still important advances to be made and this Special Issue illustrates some of them.====The Special Issue includes thirteen articles that tackle some of the most important topics in this literature. They analyse different countries, environments and episodes, using a wide variety of methods and providing novel answers to many policy-relevant questions. The first set of papers provides new evidence on migrant selection. The following group of articles delves into the core literature of the labour market impacts of immigration, with a particular focus on high-skilled immigration and selective immigration policies. A final group of papers deals with more specific - and often controversial – topics such as refugee migration, undocumented migration, and the political consequences of migrant flows. In this introduction, we first provide a summary of the different articles and of their findings in a unified context (Section 2), and we then highlight what, in our view, are the most important takeaways for migration policy (Section 3).",The economics of migration: Labour market impacts and migration policies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537120301330,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,332.0
