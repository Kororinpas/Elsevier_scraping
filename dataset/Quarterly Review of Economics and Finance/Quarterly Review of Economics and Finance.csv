This has resulted in an immense drag on the revenues and cash flows that may lead to a significant increase in corporate bankruptcies. In this paper, we investigate the impact of Covid-19 on the solvency profile of the firms in the EU member states. We introduce multiple stress scenarios on the non-financial listed firms and report a progressive increase in the probability of default, an increase of debt payback, and declining coverages. Our results indicate that the solvency profile of all firms deteriorates. The manufacturing, mining, and retail sector are most vulnerable to a decline in market capitalization and a reduction in sales revenues. The paper also examines the possible policy interventions to sustain solvency at a pre Covid-19 level. Our findings suggest that for a moderate deterioration in economic conditions, a tax deferral is sufficient. However, in the event of exacerbating business shocks, there should be hybrid support through debt and equity to avoid a meltdown. This study has important implications for policymakers, corporate managers, and creditors.","The new coronavirus (Covid-19) has exposed vulnerabilities in the corporate sector and brought forward new sets of challenges. The policymakers are facing a daunting task of supporting health care and unemployment along with interventions in economic and ==== to prevent an economic shutdown. The businesses are trying to adjust to the changing paradigm of customers and suppliers while attempting to resist the operational and financial challenges. However, despite this agility from the public and private sector, Covid-19 is putting pressure on revenues, earnings, cash flows, and solvency position of the companies.====The European Union (EU) has been severely affected by the outbreak of Covid-19, with around 15 out of 27 member countries reporting more than ten thousand infected cases.==== The reported mortality count of four member states (Spain, Italy, France, and Germany) is 31 % of the global death toll.==== There have been stringent lockdowns with restrictive movements and business closures across the EU for weeks. This has led to stalled production, drag on-demand, and ultimately revenue contraction for the companies. Consequently, the EU has experienced unprecedented economic costs compared to any other region (====). There has been a growing literature that has documented the implications of Covid-19 on financial markets and participants. ==== and ==== documented the investment styles and volatility timing of funds managers during the pandemic. ==== explored the market reaction towards the outbreak of Covid-19, while ==== highlighted industry-wise response to the spread of new coronavirus.====Such a rapidly deteriorating situation poses severe challenges for liquidity and solvency of the businesses and warrants interventions by sponsors or policymakers. The impact of Covid-19 on liquidity and possible policy intervention was recently studied by ====. They suggested that in distressed scenarios, the average firm in their global sample will need to seek a liquidity recourse. However, the study’s focus was entirely on short term liquidity management, and it did not examine the possible influence on the long term solvency of these firms, which is at least equally likely if not more and even more damaging. Given this context, it is timely to investigate how this pandemic may impair the financial soundness of the corporate sector and what could be the impact of possible responses on the solvency position.====).====Our study has multiple contributions. This is the first one to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the solvency of European firms. Just like (====), we focus on a micro viewpoint of a specific risk. However, our methodology is much broader that incorporates both market and accounting based estimates of default. Moreover, most of the prior distress assessments using stress testing like (====; ====; ====; ====; ====) are in the context of banks. Therefore, our perspective of stress testing for the solvency of non-financial firms is a unique and significant value addition in the body of related literature.

Moreover, the occurrence of several crises, including the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 (GFC), and the ongoing COVID====19 pandemic and their associated contagion risks, motivated a keen search for alternative investments that can provide diversification benefits and protection for equity portfolios.====Indeed, most researchers have focused on Gold due to its unique features.====, ====, ====, ====), but also in the face of adverse market movements by serving as a safe haven and/or a hedge in turbulent times, which was evident in the wake of several crises including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the GFC, and the ongoing COVID====19 pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====). Nonetheless, the hedging and protection properties of gold are not uniform across markets and sample periods. ==== find little evidence for the ability of gold to serve as a hedge and/or a safe haven in emerging markets, namely Brazil, China, India, and Russia. Further, ==== find other precious metals to be stronger safe havens for US equities than gold during several market downturns.====Another alternative investment that regularly makes headline news is crude oil. The crude oil shock in 1973 sparked an interest in understanding the linkages between oil prices and the global economy.==== As the stock market is the channel through which these linkages are rapidly manifested, a substantial literature has accumulated on various aspects of the crude oil-stock nexus (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).==== The Bitcoin market has experienced exponential growth over the past decade, with its prices soaring by 90-fold and its market capitalization reaching 11373% in 2021 from its levels at the start of 2016.

Despite its relatively short history, Bitcoin shares several distinctive features with gold, suggesting its potential to perform a similar role to gold as a hedge and a safe heaven. While we have alluded to some of the commonalities between Bitcoin and gold, ==== cogently delineate these common features. Given the short history of Bitcoin, most studies that evaluate its efficacy as a hedge or/and safe heaven are clustered during the COVID====19 pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====). The results from these studies are complex but suggest that Bitcoin is generally a diversifier while possessing hedging and safe-haven abilities in some cases.====In general, the findings of the aforementioned studies are complex and difficult to reconcile, with no certain commodity standing out as the best choice for hedging and risk diversification across different markets and under all circumstances. Therefore, we aim to extend the extant literature by exploring the dynamic correlations between the major alternative investment price returns and daily returns of the Saudi broad market index along with its constituent sectoral indices before and during the COVID====19 pandemic. Additionally, we use the resulting dynamic correlations to compute the optimal portfolio allocation and optimal hedge ratio in a dynamic fashion covering both sample periods to investigate their hedging and safe-haven properties. The selected alternative investments are Gold, Bitcoin, WTI crude oil, and the OVX. Our choice is justified on the following grounds: Besides expanding the repertoire of alternative investments available to investors, we intend to substantiate the available empirical evidence on the previously investigated alternative investments in the context of the Saudi market (namely, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin) and examine whether the results obtained by prior studies including ====, ====, ====, ====, and ==== hold in the wake of the COVID====19 pandemic and transcends uniformly to various sectors. The addition of the newly investigated OVX in the context of the Saudi market is motivated by empirical evidence from ====, who document a negative correlation between the OVX and the GCC stock markets, including Saudi Arabia.====We suggest that the Saudi market is conducive to such a study for several reasons. First, the Saudi market is the largest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and among the world’s largest seven markets.==== The Saudi market accounts for 80% of the GCC region’s total market capitalization, reflecting the country’s significance as the largest economy in the MENA region.==== Second, the Saudi market witnessed unprecedented growth in terms of new initial public offerings (IPOs), specifically the listing of Saudi Aramco, the second largest company after Apple in market capitalization worldwide.====).====The contribution of the present study is twofold. First, in this study, we conduct a country-level analysis of the commodity-stock nexus, which has been called for by previous research. Specifically, prior studies that evaluate the hedging and diversification properties of alternative investments for the Saudi market have focused on the broad market index (====, ====, ====, ====) or one sector, namely the banking sector (====) normally within the context of the GCC region. Indeed, ==== highlight the differences between GCC markets in several aspects,==== which drive the heterogeneity of the findings documented by subsequent studies across the GCC countries and their constituent sectors (====). Indeed, ==== show that portfolios diversified across GCC-wide sectors outperform portfolios diversified across GCC national equity markets, which is commensurate with ====, who argue that the importance of analyzing different sectors in the economy stems from the heterogeneity of these sectors, which are subjected to different market structures. Moreover, ==== emphasize that the aggregation effect that results from using regional sectoral indices outweighs the different country-level impacts in terms of the extent of the dependence of its underlying economies on a certain commodity. Second, while most related studies compare the hedging and diversification capabilities of gold against either crude oil or cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, the present study expands the range of commodities to include gold, bitcoin, oil, and OVX as well to evaluate the performance of these investments on an equal footing.====On the methodological front, we employ Engle’s bivariate dynamic conditional correlation-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC====GARCH) technique (====) to model the conditional correlations among stock indices and alternative investments that are subsequently used to calculate hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights.

I find that EPS meet-or-beat streaks that are primarily extended by firms meeting or beating analysts’ revenue forecasts are positively valued by the market but EPS streaks extended by meeting implied-expense targets are not associated with equity valuations.

The vector ==== with variance gamma innovations is proposed to capture these features before and during the pandemic outbreak.

We interpret the results concerning their technological setups.","First proposed by ====) and analysing wavelet coherence for the Coronavirus Panic Index with cases/death (====; ==== use the Largest Lyapunov Exponent and Approximate Entropy measures and test their difference before and during the pandemic outbreak as well as between cryptocurrency and equity markets. Besides, ==== and ==== adopt respectively the symmetric and asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation measures to compare market efficiency. To identify the roles of safe haven, there are also connectedness/interdependence studies using network analysis (====), modified VaR, and conditional VaR for relative portfolio downside risk (====), and variance decomposition (====Other studies take an alternative modelling approach. Addressing the heterogeneous effects across the distribution of shocks, ==== and ==== consider four connectedness/spillover indices using the normalised generalised forecast error variance decomposition measure. However, the nonparametric quantile regression model does not allow modelling of interdependency between returns. To capture the interdependency, ==== consider the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (ADCC-GARCH) model. ====, ==== adopt Student’s t innovations and analyse hundreds of actively traded cryptocurrency returns, they model one cryptocurrency at a time and thereby fail to capture the interdependency between cryptocurrencies.====To capture the extra leptokurtosis in the volatile cryptocurrency market, we propose multivariate skewed variance-gamma (MSVG) innovations applied to the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model. This model, called the VARMA-MSVG model, is pioneering in cryptocurrency literature. The VARMA model (====) provides a parsimonious description of stationary stochastic processes, incorporates dependency across cryptocurrencies, and fosters returns and thereby prices forecast. The ARMA process in returns captures price persistence which acts against the efficient market hypothesis. Moreover, the flexible MSVG distribution can capture extreme leptokurtosis and differentiate asymmetric negative/positive shocks, complementing many studies that assume symmetric error distributions. However, cryptocurrencies may behave similarly in normal times or during market turmoil in response to different levels of market uncertainty but not so across each regime. This phenomenon justifies applying the VARMA-MSVG model separately to normal and pandemic outbreak regimes. Similar to ====, we aim to study how volatility spillover and interdependency change between regimes. For the choice of cryptocurrencies, ==== indicate that Litecoin and Bitcoin are clear leaders. Further results show that Dash has some role in the network of leading cryptocurrencies due to its ability to act as a diversifier. Moreover, Ripples displays distinct behaviour from other leading cryptocurrencies as it has no overnight risk due to its frictionless, transparent, and near-instant money transfer (====, ====). This paper considers Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dash, and Ripple (XRP).====Model parameters are estimated using the expectation/conditional maximisation (ECM) algorithm by expressing the MSVG distribution in the normal mean-variance mixtures (NMVMs) representation (====, ==== which provides estimates in minutes. This advantage is particularly relevant in trading strategy setup comparing many alternative portfolios. In summary, our analyses offer several academic contributions. Firstly, our modelling approach captures multiple features to understand the market behaviour and allow return forecasts. We compare Covid-19 impact on market efficiency and return spillover related to persistence/temporal dependency using the ARMA process parameters, on interdependency and volatility spillovers using the covariance matrix, and on asymmetric sensitivity to positive and negative shocks using the skewness parameters of the MSVG distribution. Moreover, most current studies on Covid-19 impact on the cryptocurrency market observe the outbreak till July 2020. This period is short and corresponds to the first phase of the pandemic outbreak. Our sample covers a longer period till February 2021 to detect more evidence of the pandemic impact. Results detect changes in cryptocurrency market efficiency and interdependency pattern across regimes. These findings are insightful for the diversification of portfolios involving cryptocurrencies to mitigate the adverse effects of contagion risk. If, for example, volatility is transmitted from one cryptocurrency to another during the crisis period, then portfolio managers need to adjust their asset allocation to diversify risk.====The layout of the remaining paper is as follows. ==== introduces the cryptocurrency returns and some salient features of the data. ==== describes the flexible VG distribution and the VARMA-MSVG models. ==== applies the VARMA-MSVG model to study four cryptocurrency returns and discusses market and individual cryptocurrency properties.

Such unpredictable shocks not only make the world face a new normal but also initiate unwanted transformation in the globalization era. This unprecedented event has officially been declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Consequently, countries around the world come up with a range of shut down measures e.g. travel limits, business shut down, educational institutions closure, lockdowns, reduced public events, and socializing. These uncertain events along with government restrictions put unparalleled pressures on country’s economy and stock market and that is further warranted by the 31.32% drop of S&P500 on March 23, 2020 accompanied by frequent breach of circuit breaker (e.g. ====; ====). Moreover, not only COVID-19 makes investors act against the rational risk-return or alpha optimizing strategy, it also forces investors to liquidate their savings of stock market in the face of uncertain futures (e.g. ====). Consequently, this brings about a sharp fall in the capital market. Furthermore, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF), COVID-19 shrinks the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US by 8.2%. Thus, it is important to investigate the extent to which COVID-19 affects the stock market return.====Information play vital role in return predictability and capturing fluctuation of capital market. People reveal their interest to a particular aspect of economy and market by searching for the information they intend to capitalize on. Given this context, prior studies explore the importance of information on corporate actions (e.g. ====; ====) or on stock market reaction (e.g. ====). Earlier evidence attributes the market fluctuations to different phases of sentiment shocks of investors (e.g. ====; ====; ====) and to different measures of sentiment i.e. news sentiment (e.g. ====; ====), social media (e.g. ====), corporate disclosures (e.g. ====), sports events (e.g. ====) and others are widely examined in early studies. Along with these measures, investigation of sentiment and perception of people through Google search volume gain popularity in recent times (e.g. ====; ====). In COVID-19 context, studies also delve into the exploration of internet search (e.g. ====; ====; ====) and media news (e.g. ====In this paper, I utilize Google search volume index (SVI) of Google Trends (GT)==== to develop SCARES index. Google is the largest search engines with 86% of the overall market shares. As part of Google’s massive exploration, GT analyzes the search popularity of any term across such different dimensions as countries, regions, categories, frequencies, and search subcategories. More specifically, search for any term in GT represents the term’s interest over time.====This pictorial depiction claims some intuitive interpretation. During 2020, people were so much panicked and anxious about coronavirus and such situation gives unique spikes in those search terms. After first COVID-19 case detection on January 23, 2021==== in US people started to panic about coronavirus. This, consequently, initiates peaks of the SVI of these search terms in the first and second quarter of 2020 followed by sharp declines in the later part of the year. Such decline may be attributable to the fact that households’ interest, anxiety, and uncertainty about the terms go down with time. Subsequently, SVI becomes random and volatile because of the time varying demand of these search terms particularly in the policy formulation and research context.====My research makes several contributions to the strand of COVID-19 literatures. First, I develop SCARES index using backward rolling regressions of the key COVID-19 search terms of GT. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that develops a composite COVID-19 sentiment, the SCARES index, related to coronavirus using internet search. Earlier studies primarily focus on daily COVID-19 cases and/or deaths as the mainstream proxies to measure the severity of pandemic (e.g. ====; ====; ====). I use objective analysis to measure the COVID-19 fatalities in addition to externally supplied secondary source. Closest paper that matches to my analysis is that of ====, I compress the search terms specifically in COVID-19 dimensions and use rolling regression to choose the important search terms as objectively as possible. Likewise, my study is also related to that of ==== who utilizes Google search volume to measure COVID-19 investor attention. Author concludes that the increase in COVID-19 related Google search has negative impact on stock market. However, ==== considers only “coronavirus” keyword search term as measure of search based investor attention. Unlike ====, I develop SCARES COVID-19 sentiment by objectively selecting keywords from a broader set of COVID-19 related search terms. Second, prior evidence, among other aspects, primarily focus on the impact of COVID-19 on market return (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====) and volatility (e.g. ====; ====) context. Unlike these studies, my paper shifts the gear and investigates the impact of COVID-19 sentiment on decile decomposition of firm characteristics-sorted portfolio returns. Third, I make the first attempt to analyze the COVID-19 sentiment on factor returns. Prior studies analyze the impact of pandemic on firm level performance (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====). In a different aspect, I investigate the impact of COVID-19 sentiment on factor returns i.e. FF5 and MOM. Fourth, I integrate other event responsive feedback indices i.e. twitter based uncertainty, business condition, volatility index, infectious diseases equity market volatility, liquidity, and economic policy uncertainty with SCARES index and conduct regime switching investigation of the link between SCARES index and broad set of above mentioned indices.====Rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses the literature review. ==== presents data and methodology. ==== outlines the results and discussion. ==== discusses conclusion.",The sum of all SCARES COVID-19 sentiment and asset return,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976922000941,18 August 2022,2022,Research Article,26.0

According to ====, this can be explained by “the requirements of Islamic law [which, according to him, reduce] the exposure [of banks] to the risk that could be generated by toxic credits.” Indeed, and since investment with an ex-ante fixed income (riba) is prohibited, as well as hoarding, the saver is, ipso facto, an investor, which implies the absence of a gap between investment and savings in Islamic finance. Moreover, backing any financial transaction with a tangible asset is one of the fundamental principles of Islamic finance. ====, ====). Thus, Islamic finance is supposed to ensure a close link between the real economy and finance. ==== adds that the link is obvious not only because Islamic financial institutions cannot sell what they do not own, but also, and above all, because they consider their clients as partners.Nevertheless, the superiority of Islamic finance in terms of resilience remains ambiguous at both the empirical and the theoretical levels. In the theoretical literature, there is a debate between the supporters of Islamic finance and its detractors who think that it is nothing but religious hypocrisy. Proponents of Islamic finance argue that its business model differs significantly from that of conventional finance and that this difference enhances its efficiency and stability (====, ====). However, those who regard Islamic finance as religious hypocrisy (e.g., ====) point out that Islamic and conventional finance are different in form but similar in substance and add that Islamic banks have no particular advantages in terms of efficiency and stability.

Section 4 concludes.==== In 1963, Ahmad al-Najjar created a small savings-investment bank in the agricultural town of Mit Ghamr (Egypt), hence the name of this entity. This bank invested the deposits in its possession in the real estate sector. In 1967, when the bank’s network spread throughout the country through nine branches, increasing the number of depositors by 14 times and the volume of deposits by 45 times between 1963 and 1967, the authorities decided to close the bank and liquidate all its assets. The government justified this decision with a number of reasons, the main ones being the failure to comply with registration and licensing procedures and the incompetence of the bank’s managers ensuring effective management of the funds collected. ==== The idea of creating an Islamic bank was first discussed at the supranational level during the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Lahore, Pakistan, from 22 to 24 February 1974, four months after the first oil shock. Indeed, following a suggestion made by Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Somalia, the OIC member countries decided by mutual agreement, to create a supranational financial institution. This initiative took shape in 1974 with the creation of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) based in Jeddah, the first financial institution to insert the adjective -Islamic’ in its corporate name. The emergence of this bank, currently owned by a consortium of 56 countries, responded to the need to establish an institution capable of financing government projects and promoting economic and social development in countries with a Muslim tradition. At the time of its creation, no one knew what an Islamic bank could be or how it should operate to comply with Shari’a rules. It took no less than two years for the IDB to complete its first murabaha transaction with Algeria. Public support for the establishment of an “Islamic bank” has stimulated private initiative in GCC countries. The first the private Islamic bank, the Dubai Islamic Bank, was established in 1975. Since then, the number of Islamic banks has continued to grow, first in Arab countries, then in Asia and finally in the West: It was not until 22 years after the creation of the first private Islamic bank in Dubai that the first Western conventional bank, Citibank, decided to open its first Islamic banking subsidiary in Bahrain in 1997. The adoption of Islamic finance by conventional banks can be explained by the high savings potential of these Gulf-sponsored institutions.====.",The Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Islamic and conventional financial markets: International empirical evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976922000515,27 April 2022,2022,Research Article,54.0

Our results provide relevant insights into systemic integration between countries’ banking markets, especially during difficult times. Our results are significant to Central Banks, banking sector investors, and governments seeking assistance from banks in the solutions for the resumption of the economy in the face of the COVID-19 shock.","The interconnection between markets has been studied through different techniques and approaches. The relevance of these studies stems from the attempt to understand the relationships between different countries, markets, and types of assets, in a context of globalization of information, displacement of people, trade, ==== Observing the connectivity mechanisms provides a better basis for constructing crisis coping and risk mitigation strategies, being a concern of regulatory bodies, like the Central Banks and economic agents, to strengthen their management strategies. For policymakers, mapping the movements adds an understanding of the systemic risks to which their country is exposed. It allows them to evaluate which markets should be on their radar and subsidize the construction of risk matrices that associate frequency and severity to the domestic market in the face of shocks from other countries.====We observe the impacts of the current health crisis through the Spillover Index, as presented by ====, among the banking markets of 35 countries around the world, with a sample of developed and developing economies, from different geographical regions and different economic blocs. We use indices representing the share values of companies in the banking sector in each of the countries studied between July 2005 and December 2021, analyzing the volatilities in each country. We compare the results for the complete sample with 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. We employ Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models and the Spillover Index (====). This methodology has been widely used in analyzes of this nature in the most recent studies on the subject (====, ====, ====, ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====).====Our primary research question is whether the pandemic (worldwide exogenous shock) has changed the connectedness across banking markets. The answer is positive. We construct a ranking of spillover for the main transmitters of shocks and main receivers. We then evaluate whether increases in spillover and connectedness are mainly due to geographic proximity.====Our results demonstrate the connectivity of volatilities between the banking markets of all the countries studied, varying in intensity over time. We observe that the general level of spillover increases in times of crisis. The increase in the spillover that occurred in 2020 for the banking markets’ volatilities is the largest in the historical series, surpassing the 2008 peak. However, the year 2021 showed different behavior even during the crisis, with a reduction in the level of connectivity as countries sought reopening measures still under the impact of waves of infection that affected them in different ways.====The 2005–2019 sample analysis shows that blocks with a higher degree of connectivity formed according to the countries’ geographic locations, with a more substantial spillover effect among the nearest neighbors. The characteristic formation of blocks linked to geographical proximity lost relevance in the face of the pandemic shock. These results provide essential insights to guide portfolio allocation and risk management decisions.====We have three significant contributions to the literature. The first is to unravel the impacts of the pandemic caused by the new Coronavirus - COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) on the banking systems of emerging and developed countries. Second, we show that spillover between banking systems increased sharply during the pandemic shock period. Third, we show that the ranking of countries that transmit or receive the most initial shocks changes during the pandemic. These results are essential to discuss and improve the financial regulation of these countries. The increase in spillover found in the paper during the COVID-19 paves the way for potential widespread losses across different economic agents and countries. Thus, when designing stress-test scenarios, one should also consider adverse scenarios further in the tails of loss distributions during periods in which the spillover is very strong.====We structure this paper into five sections and this introduction.

For this, we have used eight different models to examine the earnings dynamics. The results based on these eight different models are different depending upon the specification of the model used. Nevertheless, all the models have some common characteristics. They show that both permanent and transitory components are significant in determining income inequality. The permanent component dominates the temporary component for most of the considered period, which means that the labour market is rigid. The individuals’ starting point determines their lifetime earning profile. It also implies that low-paid individuals will see lower incomes throughout their life. This paper further examines the transmission of income shocks to consumption, based on the association at lags of unexplained income and consumption expenditure growth. The covariance gives information about the effect of income shocks on expenditure if the measurement errors in income and measurement errors in expenditure are uncorrelated (orthogonal).

Three strategies were analysed: vaccination (with 95 % and 50 % efficacy against death), a mitigation strategy, and no intervention. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. The value of a vaccine includes savings from avoiding COVID-19 mitigation measures and productivity loss, as well as health benefits from preventing COVID-19 related mortality. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19.====A vaccine with a 95 % efficacy dominates the mitigation strategy strictly. The value-based price (€6,431) is thus determined by the comparison between vaccination and no intervention. The price is particularly sensitive to the full vaccination rate and the duration of vaccine protection. In contrast, the value of a vaccine with 50 % efficacy is more ambiguous.====This study yields a value-based price for a COVID-19 vaccine with 95 % efficacy, which is considerably greater than the purchasing price.","During the first three waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the German federal government and federal states pursued a COVID-19 mitigation strategy (====). This included measures such as partial shutdown of businesses, social distancing, contact tracking, testing, public mask wearing, and quarantine orders (====). An important goal of this strategy was to control COVID-19 outbreaks or postpone them (‘flatten the curve’) and thus avoid over-stretching the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity at peak demand (cf. ====). At the time of writing of this manuscript, the forth SARS-CoV-2 wave has begun in Germany and is dominated by the Delta variant.====In November 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna independently announced that their vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The case splits between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo indicate a vaccine efficacy rate above 90 %. The European Commission approved the Biontech-Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for use across the 27 Member States on December 21, 2020 and January 6, 2021, respectively.

Given the pressing public health needs, manufacturers do not seek maximum returns (====) and therefore, the prices are cost-based rather than value-based (====). Cost-plus pricing includes a profit mark-up and may also be used in advanced market commitments, which entail purchasing a vaccine at a pre-agreed volume (====). In contrast, value-based pricing (VBP) sets the prices of medical technologies based on their health benefits and other factors.

Using panel data from Vietnam during 2007–2019 and the two-step system generalized method of moments estimator in dynamic panel models, we find consistent evidence that banking uncertainty hampers the overall return of banks. In more detail, our analysis suggests that the adverse impact of banking uncertainty on net interest income dominates the favorable ones on aggregate non-interest income and loan loss provisions.

We focus on the effects of unexpected price shocks to three groups of commodities of the sector, understood as supply shocks, on the unanticipated changes in the IPCA, Brazil's official inflation index. Supply-side shocks related to the energy sector, the exchange rate and the international agricultural commodity prices are also considered. The theoretical basis is the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve and the econometric procedures applied to the quarterly data from 2001 to 2019 are related to the analysis of autoregressive vectors – Impulse Response Functions (IRF), Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD), and Historical Decomposition of Forecast Errors (HDFE). We use two specifications: one that assumes that changes in domestic prices implicitly reflect the effects of both international dollar prices and exchange rate shocks and other which explicitly includes these two variables together with an aggregate agricultural price. The benefit of using of the two specifications is twofold: test the robustness of analytical context and examine the external components of the Brazilian inflation. The main results are: i) expected inflation, grains and diesel prices and the exchange rate stand out in explaining the variability of IPCA forecasting errors, and shocks in the IPCA itself are also relevant; ii) although of relevant magnitude, shocks to IPCA itself dissipate quickly, while supply shocks, because they are relatively large, even with small coefficients in IRF, have important impacts on inflation; iii) shocks to international prices and exchange rate affect domestic aggregate agricultural price; and iv) unanticipated supply shocks (from agriculture, energy, and exchange rate) plus inflation expectation jointly played a disinflationary role in 2018 and 2019.",None,Agriculture and inflation: Expected and unexpected shocks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976921001794,7 December 2021,2021,Research Article,92.0

We find that dependence between GDP and unemployment disturbances is strong only in USA and France followed by Canada, the UK and Germany. There is no dependence in Italy and Japan. This enhances the validity of Okun's law in the former countries without invalidating it in Italy and Japan, since there is still a negative relationship given by the systematic part of the output-unemployment difference equations estimates.

I find that a pure commodity money regime can only generate an efficient stationary equilibrium by divine coincidence or by giving policymakers control over the supply of the commodity. The introduction of bank notes makes it much more likely that the economy will achieve an efficient equilibrium. In particular, in a commodity-based system, bank notes are equivalent to call options on the commodity and the commodity holdings are equivalent to a put option on the commodity. Assuming that there is no risk-free arbitrage in equilibrium, then both bank notes and the commodity will have an expected rate of return equal to the risk-free rate. If the risk-free rate is equal to the rate of time preference, then this commodity regime is efficient. A free banking system would therefore not only minimize deviations between the supply and demand for money, but it would also (potentially) implement the Friedman rule.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in ‘flattening’ or ‘squashing the curve’ in Germany.====In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19.====A shutdown that is successful in ‘flattening the curve’ is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.01 and 0.05 life years (0.1 to 0.6 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between €616 and €4797 per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 1%–12% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in ‘squashing the curve’ is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.08 life years (1 month) per capita, corresponding to 19 % of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases.====A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population. Nevertheless, questions around the ==== and underfunding of other parts of the healthcare system emerge.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was identified first in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was recognized as a pandemic (a worldwide spread of a new disease (====) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. It was confirmed to have been transmitted to Germany on January 27, 2020. As of August 13, 2020, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Germany is 219,964, while the case fatality rate (CFR) is 4.2 %. The latter may present an overestimate due to undiagnosed cases in the population and deaths of COVID-19 patients attributable to concomitant diseases. The median age of death was 82 years on August 13, 2020 (====).====The German federal government and the German federal states initially responded with travel restrictions and the closures of schools, universities, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other public and private entities. Although some restrictions have been lifted in the meantime, others remain in place. In Germany, the initial purpose of the shutdown of businesses was to postpone the pandemic waves (‘flatten the curve’) to avoid overstretching intensive care capacity at the time of peak demand (cf. ====). Hence, intensive care capacity presents a critical bottleneck in responding to the pandemic. ‘Flattening the curve’ may buy time to expand health and intensive care capacities as well as to develop and test new vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or drugs. The process of developing, approving, and distributing a vaccine may take until the end of 2021 even in the United States (U.S.) ==== . Moreover, there is a “race” to find COVID-19 treatments by repurposing drugs that are already approved for other diseases and have acceptable safety profiles (====). Given the necessary time lag, however, ‘flattening the curve’ may only be able to halt the epidemic by achieving herd immunity through natural infection and not through vaccination.====A more rigorous strategy than ‘flattening the curve’ is stopping or ‘squashing’ the curve. This strategy, which has been pursued in Germany for the past months, aims at suppressing the pandemic, by bringing the reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections due to a single primary infected person) (substantially) below 1, until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes available (cf. ====).====As a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the governmental response, the German economy is being hit by a combined supply and demand shock (====). Trade-offs between protecting lives and revitalizing the economy thus seem inevitable. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and economic value of minimizing the number of life years lost due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. While I will refer specifically to a ‘shutdown’ in the following, COVID-19 containment measures go beyond a shutdown of businesses and include tracking, testing, public mask-wearing, and other measures that are largely independent of a shutdown. The study takes an ex-ante viewpoint, i.e., before a potential surge of COVID-19 cases in further pandemic waves possibly overstretches ICU capacity. I determine the clinical and economic value both of ‘squashing’ and ‘flattening’ the curve, thus assuming, respectively, that a new vaccine will and will not be available before herd immunity through natural infection is achieved. Hence, while ‘flattening the curve’ slows the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and hence prevents a sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases, it is not assumed to prevent herd immunity through natural infection (cf. ====). As the study does not analyze specific subgroups of the population but the population in aggregate, minimizing the number of life years lost by ‘flattening the curve’ thus effectively translates into minimizing lives lost as well as minimizing the CFR at the time of herd immunity. Moreover, when ‘flattening the curve’ the economic value of minimizing the number of life years lost corresponds to the maximum economic value of a shutdown that is 100 % effective at preventing an overstretch of ICU capacity (because a successful shutdown leads to a minimization of lives lost and life years lost). Hence, under a scenario in which the spread of the virus in the population is unavoidable, a shutdown that is successful in ‘flattening the curve’ presents the best-case scenario. In contrast, when ‘squashing the curve’, losses of life years and lives are minimized by reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections until the time a new vaccine will be available.====As a comparator of a shutdown that is successful in ‘flattening’ or ‘squashing” the curve, I considered a scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. While this scenario presents an extreme (worst) case, it is appropriate to determine the maximum health benefit of a successful shutdown and calculate the maximum economic value of the shutdown. This allows a comparison with actual and expected public spending during and after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. In addition, for ‘flattening the curve’ the study considers alternative scenarios with ICU capacity being exceeded by varying amounts. These scenarios help assess the maximum economic value of freeing up or adding ICU capacity while ‘flattening the curve’.",The clinical and economic value of a successful shutdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976920301241,14 October 2020,2020,Research Article,133.0

We survey the relevant literature and describe the Fed's new operating regime. Then we explain how the regime change reduced de facto ====. In brief, the regime change increased the appointment power of the President and improved the bargaining power of Congress. We offer some suggestions for bolstering de facto independence at the Fed.","At least since ==== But one must be careful not to confuse the desirable with the factual.==== The Federal Reserve is not immune to political pressure (====). Indeed, it is ==== independent than most other central banks. ==== present four indices of central bank independence for eighty-nine countries in 2010.==== Depending on the measure employed, the United States ranked 82nd (tie), 83rd (tie), 84th (tie), or 87th. ==== offers two additional measures of central bank independence. Out of one hundred seventy-nine countries observed in 2012, the United States ranked 136th or 158th. The Fed, in other words, does not appear to be very independent.====Anecdotal evidence serves to illustrate the potential for political influence at the Fed.==== It is widely accepted that an incumbent President's odds of reelection suffer when the unemployment rate is high (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). It is also widely believed that President Nixon conspired with Federal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns to exploit that relationship.==== As ==== reports, “Evidence from the Nixon tapes [...] clearly reveals that President Nixon pressured Burns, both directly and indirectly through Office of Management and Budget Director George Shultz, to engage in expansionary monetary policies prior to the 1972 election.”==== The pressure seems to have worked. Burns obliged.==== Nixon was reelected. And the rest, as they say, is history.====More generally, economists have identified two channels through which short-term politics might influence the Fed's monetary policy decisions. The first is a product of the appointment process. Members of the Board of Governors (BOG), including the Chair and Vice Chair, are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Governors are permitted to serve one full 14-year term. However, those appointed to complete the balance of a term may be reappointed for a full term. From among the Governors, the President selects—and Senate confirms—a Chair and Vice Chair. The Chair and Vice Chair serve four-year terms and may be reappointed and serve until their term as Governor expires.====A Governor cannot be removed from the Board for his policy views. But he can be ==== based on his policy views.==== And, if he was appointed to complete the balance of a term, his reappointment might depend on policies supported while serving. Likewise, a Chair or Vice Chair might fail to secure reappointment based on her policy views. In this case, she would either serve out the remainder of her term as a mere Governor or, more typically, resign (====).==== As such, the appointment process opens the door for political influence.====How important is the appointment process? The BOG accounts for seven of the twelve votes cast in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, where the federal funds rate target is chosen.==== ==== shows that Governors dissent in predictable ways given the party of the President who appointed them.==== ==== find that Fed policy is more likely to be expansionary in the seven quarters prior to an election if the Fed Chair was appointed by the incumbent President's party. Perhaps this explains why, in the last fifty years, no President has failed to reappoint a Fed Chair appointed by a President of his own party.====Short-term politics might also influence monetary policy through a second channel, which results from congressional oversight.==== The Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress. Congress might amend that act to provide for policy audits or otherwise limit the Fed's discretionary powers.====The interaction between Fed and Congress has traditionally been considered in the context of budgetary policy (====, ====).==== In brief, the Fed must decide how much of its revenues to spend and how much to remit to the Treasury in an environment where monitoring is costly. If it remits too much, it forgoes additional personnel and other amenities that would improve working conditions at the Fed. If it remits too little, it risks losing the discretion that enables it to make such decisions in the future. Hence, the Fed's objective function is constrained by congressional oversight.====Much the same could be said about the Fed's monetary policy decisions. Fed officials presumably have some preferred course of action in mind. And Congress incurs some cost—perhaps a reduction in political capital—when it chooses to punish the Fed. If the Fed defers to Congress in setting monetary policy, it risks ending up with what it considers to be worse policies. If it deviates too far from the course of action preferred by Congress, it risks losing the discretion that enables it to make such decisions in the future. Along these lines, ==== find that the Fed adjusted monetary policy in response to bills credibly threatening its power. Likewise, ====, ====) finds that monetary policy is affected by the leadership on the relevant congressional oversight committees.====Most economists agree that the Fed conducts monetary policy reasonably well. They also maintain that an independent central bank, insulated from short-term political pressure, is more likely to implement desirable policies. It is, therefore, easy to understand their tendency to assume the Fed enjoys a high degree of independence—a tendency regularly reinforced by official Fed statements (====).====In contrast, we agree with ====, who maintain that “Federal Reserve de jure independence is far too uncritically accepted as a foundation for a stable financial and monetary environment.” The Fed lacks a high degree of de jure independence. It is structured under law in such a way that permits political pressure through the appointment process and congressional oversight.====How has monetary policy been conducted reasonably well if the Fed lacks a high degree of de jure independence? Recognizing the two channels for political influence outlined above suggests an explanation. In brief, the Fed has conducted monetary policy reasonably well despite lacking a high degree of de jure independence because the President and Congress have been sufficiently constrained from abusing their legally-established powers to influence monetary policy. The Fed, in other words, has enjoyed a high degree of de facto independence. Moreover, loosening the constraints on the President and Congress—as we argue the Fed's new operating regime does in Section 2—would reduce the Fed's de facto independence, even if its de jure independence were unchanged. And, to the extent that a high degree of de facto independence improves monetary policy, the Fed would tend to produce worse monetary policy as a result.",Central bank independence and the Federal Reserve's new operating regime,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106297692030123X,14 October 2020,2020,Research Article,135.0

Second, it aims to fill the research gap in analysis of risk in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this regard, for six daily stock indices in the MENA region, from January 3, 2005 to December 31, 2014, we employ a vine copula-based generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) method and the extreme value theory (EVT) to model the dependence between the marginal distributions of returns and forecast the VaR. Based on backtesting, we assess the efficiency of the standard risk measurement models from the following families—the exponentially weighted moving average, the historical simulation, and the GARCH. By implementing the GARCH-EVT-C-vine method in the MENA region, we find that, empirically, standard methods overestimate (underestimate) the violation ratio, implying an underestimation (overestimation) of the risk, and therefore a misallocation of the capital covering the risk. The method also provides better VaR estimates for the MENA stock markets than that of the standard methods. We also verify that the greater the openness of the capital accounts and the flexibility of the exchange rate regimes, the greater will be the conditional dependence of the MENA countries on the developed markets. Finally, the empirical method we propose has an important implication for the MENA countries in that it can be adopted by these countries to forecast VaR effectively.",None,Revisiting the accuracy of standard VaR methods for risk assessment: Using the Copula–EVT multidimensional approach for stock markets in the MENA region,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976920301150,5 October 2020,2020,Research Article,139.0

We investigate how the relationship between crude oil and stock market returns for a heterogeneous selection of oil exporters and importers has been affected in the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a contagion test based on local Gaussian correlation with high frequency intraday data, we provide evidence of significantly higher correlations between oil and stock markets returns during the COVID-19 outbreak for all countries in our sample. The results also show that stock markets of commodity exporters in different groups of countries have stronger correlations with oil returns than their importing counterparts. Our results are robust to different crisis dating and consistent across different segments of the ==== distributions. These findings indicate a more limited role of oil in portfolio diversification during the global health crisis, which has implications for the hedging strategies of investors in the stock markets of oil exporting and importing countries alike.","The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy have been forecasted to be ==== than the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (====), resulting in ==== (====). As well documented by ====, no previous infectious disease outbreak (including the Spanish Flu) has ever affected the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic.====Considering the crude oil market, although episodes of oil price fluctuations have occurred since the commercialisation of oil (==== crisis is unlike a ====Shortly into the new year, equity indices around the world dipped for a stint as the markets absorbed information about the geopolitical tensions in the wake of the assassination of the Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq. At the same time, prices in the crude oil market experienced an uptick likely as a hedging strategy for equities and due to perceived oil supply disruptions in the OPEC market. The oil price buoyancy quickly abated as the coronavirus proliferated around the world. Transportation, which is almost 60% of global crude oil demand, dramatically plummeted in the first quarter of 2020 alone (====). For hydrocarbon assets, sector level data of world stock markets show that oil, gas, and coal firms lead the negative returns, which are approximately 50% lower than prices at the start of 2020, driven primarily by a plummet in oil prices and depressed global consumption (====). Yet another remarkable event is historically low benchmark crude oil prices as a result of a storage scarcity related to the physical delivery of the hard commodity: the Brent fell below $20 per barrel against an average of $64 in 2019; and the WTI dropped into negative territory for the first time in history at ====$37.63 per barrel on 2020/04/20.====Crude oil is a globally influential commodity because it is the major source of primary energy, followed by other hydrocarbons resources like coal and natural gas.====). However, the existence, sign, and nature of the dependence structure between the crude oil and stock markets is less straightforward (see, e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====Oil and stock market returns might present a negative correlation: increases in oil prices are reflected in increases in production costs and therefore linked to decreasing stock returns.====, ====). This is a plausible assumption given that stock markets absorb all available information, including the developments in the crude oil market (====).====Moreover, the net oil exporting/importing status of different countries seems to matter, with increasing evidence in favour of a country-specific nature of such a linkage (see, e.g. ====).====Given the above, ascertaining the nature of the association between crude oil and stock markets is particularly important, as the presence of an oil-stock market contagion will matter for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers. A negative (positive) correlation between oil and the stock markets during crisis periods will enhance (decrease) the perceived benefits of using oil as an hedging tool for stocks within diversified portfolios. It will also have important implications for policy-makers, who will need to closely monitor the evolution of the oil-stock market nexus during crises in order to design appropriate stabilisation policies, given the macroeconomic links discussed above.====Given our discussion, it is not surprising that crude oil has prominently featured in the developing economic literature on the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, more recent studies have been aimed at ascertaining the impact of COVID-19 on oil prices (see, e.g. ====, ====, ==== and references therein).==== (see, e.g. ==== documenting a connectedness between the WTI oil futures and 10 disaggregated Chinese stock indices). Further research (e.g. ====, ====, ==== and references therein) has associated the time-domain analysis of the spillover index with wavelet/frequency-based techniques, generally documenting positive spillovers between crude oil and selected stock markets.====Other researchers have adopted dynamic correlation approaches (e.g. ==== on oil prices and selected US energy stocks, ==== among different assets classes, including oil, and ==== on oiland the US stock market).====Panel techniques have also been used, to circumvent the small sample issue associated with lower frequency data on the first wave of the pandemic (see, e.g. ====).====Our contribution differs from the above cited works in methodology, data, application, and findings. In particular, we focus on correlation and contagion rather than causation, and we use high frequency intraday data (at 5 min intervals) to tackle the small sample issue in analysing the changing relationship between crude oil and stock markets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is of particular relevance as contagion, defined as an increase in cross-market linkages in the wake of a shock to one market (====), is appropriately detected using a high frequency approach, as it can appear and vanish very quickly (====).====Moreover, our focus on a ==== of a sample of three oil exporting and three oil importing countries across G7 (Canada and Japan), BRICS (Russia and China), and Scandinavian (Norway and Sweden) countries allows us to determine whether the nature of the oil-stock market relationship is context specific in the current crisis, as the previous literature seems to suggest. In particular, the heterogeneous composition of the countries in our sample provides comparative insights for the relationship between crude oil and the stock markets of exporters and importers in advanced, emerging, and small economies during the COVID-19 pandemic.====Our empirical analysis is based on the local Gaussian correlation introduced by ==== and the contagion testing in ====, which allows us to examine the nexus between the crude oil and stock market at different segments of the assets return distributions. Using this non-parametric, local approach of measuring dependence structures is optimal when dealing with heavy tailed distributions and in nonlinear situations.====Considering previous studies applying the local Gaussian methodology to contagion testing, ==== provide evidence of flight-to-quality from stocks to crude oil during different financial crises; ==== finds contagion between energy commodities and the US stock market. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this type of analysis to the ongoing global pandemic and to high frequency data in general. Further, as we focus on the instantaneous linkages between the oil and stock markets, our research will be particularly relevant for policymakers and investors, allowing a prompt detection of contagion to inform portfolio diversification and risk management strategies.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section ==== presents the methodology, detailing the pre-filtering process of the intraday data, the local Gaussian correlation approach, and the specification of a contagion test based on this procedure. Next, Section ==== describes all data used for the analysis.

The empirical results, applied on major world stock market indices and currencies, and based on the multivariate asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation model, show the effectiveness of Bitcoin and gold as hedging assets in reducing the risk of international portfolios. Moreover, the analysis provides evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, gold is a weak safe haven for the considered assets, while Bitcoin cannot provide shelter due to its increased variability.","The COVID-19 pandemic has succeeded in looting and destabilizing the entire world. In just few months, it endangered not only lives, but also economic borders, global businesses and the very essence of the world's financial equilibrium. This crisis caused the closure of borders, a sharp slowdown in the global economy and a stock market crash on March 11, 2020. Consequently, many investors turned to uncorrelated assets to hedge their portfolios in order to cope with the crisis and support the recovery.====Throughout its history, gold has been viewed as a value store, portfolio stabilizer and source of liquidity in times of financial turbulence. Gold is known as a hedge against inflationary pressures in the U.S. and U.K. (====) and works differently from other assets, especially stocks. When prices of stock market indices plummet, gold retains its value. Its effectiveness as a hedge and safe haven against equities in different markets is well confirmed by numerous studies (e.g., ====; ====, among others).====However, ==== showed that investor behavior can destroy the hedging potential of gold due to increased investment in the precious metal for hedging and speculation purposes. For example, ==== used a dynamic correlation model to show that precious metals had a hedging role for stock market indices in American and European countries; nevertheless, this role have dissipated after 2013.====).====Obviously, this has led Bitcoin and gold to compete for the status of the most effective protective asset. Compared to gold, Bitcoin must overcome several challenges, particularly in terms of history, acceptance, consumption, intrinsic value and low volatility. However, gold and Bitcoin share several characteristics. (i) First, they both escape political influence and are regulated like commodities, especially in the U.S. where Bitcoin is considered a commodity by the CFTC institution. (ii) Second, no central authority intervenes to adjust or control their mining transactions and activities (====) and gold (====).====Researches on the link between the prices of gold and those of other assets, and the potential for hedge and safe haven continue to grow remarkably. Indeed, Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets makes it desirable for diversification (====; ====; ====), and a valuable hedge against stock markets (====, ====) and commodities (====).====The economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on financial markets has recently become a topic of interest. This has reignited the debate over whether the cryptocurrency has the ability to mimic or beat gold hedging and safe haven property against stocks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, a limited number of studies have analyzed Bitcoin and gold (====, ====, ====) without a comparable study between their roles against financial assets. To fill the gap in the literature, our study draws new insights into the potential of Bitcoin and gold to hedge against fluctuations in financial markets and their role as safe haven during the COVID-19 virus outbreak.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

It spread across the world and infected more than 134 million people in 219 countries.==== The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it to be a global pandemic. The associated macroeconomic shock was evident in early March 2020, with global financial markets witnessing volatility and stock market moves on a scale not seen since the 2008 world financial crisis (====; ====). Even though previous pandemics have left traces on financial markets, no prior contagious disease, including the Spanish Flu, has affected the stock market as strongly as the COVID-19 pandemic (====). By mid-March, the U.S. stock market bull run that had lasted 11 years (the lengthiest on record) had ended and the fastest decline on record followed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had fallen nearly 6,400 points (approximately 26%). The S&P 500 Index had closed on a record high of 3386.15 on 19 February 2020 but in March it dropped by over 30% (====).====The key features of financial markets are liquidity and stability. Liquidity is often studied as an important attribute of ﬁnancial assets and it plays a vital role in the ﬁnancial markets’ operations (====). ==== indicate that markets characterized by high liquidity are inclined to attract more attention from investors. ==== and ==== indicate that market deteriorations can result from market illiquidity. They claim that the 1987 stock market crash, at least to some extent, stemmed from problems in stock trading and a fall in liquidity. Accordingly, liquidity is important for investors, and its significance increases at times of financial crisis, when markets are highly uncertain (====). ==== point out that liquidity is considered as a key concern at the time of COVID-19 and we agree that evaluating and understanding the impact of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19 on stock liquidity has become an important issue.====In this study, we focus on the S&P 500 stocks, for several reasons. First, previous studies (e.g., ====; ====We use S&P 500 firms’ stock data and the numbers of reported cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths to empirically analyze the influence of the pandemic on the liquidity of stocks. Using a panel regression approach and two measures of stock liquidity (tightness of the order book and the Amihud measure), we find evidence of a negative and significant effect on stock liquidity of the daily growth in the numbers of both COVID-19 cases and deaths. This finding is robust to using alternative estimation methods and an alternative proxy for liquidity. Our results also suggest a significant difference in stock liquidity between sectors. In particular, the pandemic significantly impacts the consumer staples, consumer discretionary, financial, information technology, basic materials, energy and industrial sectors. However, the healthcare and communications sectors have better liquidity than the market overall, implying that these sectors benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is worth noting that the real estate sector’s liquidity is insignificantly affected by the growth in the numbers of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. These results indicate that some ==== sectors perform better than others throughout the spread and outbreak of COVID-19.====This study makes several contributions to the literature on the effects of a pandemic on financial markets. Firstly, while prior studies focus on the impact of COVID-19 on many issues, such as stock market returns (====; ====; ====; ====), volatility (====; ====), financial markets (====), stock market risk (====), stock price (====) and corporate performance (====), in this study we perform a novel analysis of how the COVID-19 pandemic has driven firm-level liquidity for S&P 500 firms. Secondly, we perform a unique sector analysis to examine the effect of COVID-19 on stock liquidity between various sectors. Thirdly, we employ different estimation methods to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock liquidity. These results indicate that COVID-19 influences stock liquidity and there are liquidity differences across sectors (certain sectors perform better than others during the spread and outbreak of COVID-19). Finally, our ﬁndings have implications for financial market participants such as ﬁnancial securities regulators, firms, and investors.====The rest of this study is organized as follows.

As an alternative, we consider hedging a derivative portfolio by taking a contrary position in a credit index, evaluating the empirical market risk that remains after such hedge. We perform three different hedging exercises: for single-names, for sectorial portfolios and for regional portfolios. We implement least squares hedging as a benchmark, and compare its efficiency with a hedge ratio estimated under the RiskMetrics exponentially moving average (EWMA) specification for time varying second order moments, as well as with the hedge ratio obtained from a bivariate GARCH model for the portfolio and the credit index used as a hedge. Over the 2007–2012 period, we find a high hedging efficiency for regional portfolios (Europe, North America and Japan), as well as for a global portfolio, which is back at pre-crisis levels. The EWMA hedge is slightly more efficient than the least-squares hedge, while the GARCH hedge does not improve hedging efficiency. Hedging efficiency is not as high for sectorial credit portfolios from Europe and North America, due to their more important idiosyncratic component. Taking into account the quality of the credit counterpart improves the effectiveness of the hedge, although it requires using less liquid credit indices, with higher transaction costs. This hedging strategy becomes much more complex if firms in the portfolio have a large idiosyncratic component. The efficiency of the hedge is higher when liquidity risk and systematic risk are high, or when the term structure is flat.

An increase in geopolitical risk is associated with positive (negative) oil (stock) returns and is consistent with geopolitical risk been linked more closely to supply disruption.

We contend that access to financial services defined too broadly is an imprecise measure for evaluating the influence of inclusion on financial stability.

We develop a theoretical model to study what the real effects of accounting on financial institutions’ investment decision are. Doing so, we show that fair value accounting may incentivize banks to underinvest in long-term risky assets, while historical cost accounting may incentivize them to invest too much in those assets. At first sight, bank accounting thus appears as a choice between bad and worse. We show that this is not necessarily the case.

Given that Us and Asia-Pacific banks react differently to a ban on short selling depending on the particular financial structure of each market, when taking these actions, policy makers should consider which firm characteristics are most important and should pay attention to whether these interventions are effective in the market. Moreover, short-selling restrictions did not contribute to containing the volatility of the financial stocks subjected to the bans; on the contrary, our results indicate that negative volatility increased in some countries.",None,Why do banks react differently to short-selling bans?

However, the EPU causes Bitcoin volatility at the intermediate and high quantiles. Further analysis considering the asymmetric causality in quantiles suggests that the causality running from EPU to the Bitcoin returns is sourced from increased EPU levels (positive variations), while the decrease in EPU (negative variations) is the source of causality from EPU to Bitcoin volatility.

In non-OECD economies, the multipliers of compensation of government employees and government investment are positive but smaller than those for the OECD group and they do not tend to differ in recessions and in expansions.

The prospect of returning to such a monetary system raises several important questions that would need to be addressed prior to its implementation. What would the appropriate parity be? How much gold would it require? Is the existing gold stock sufficient to support it? How much would it cost? This paper takes up these questions for the world's largest economies. I argue that the current market price of gold closely approximates the appropriate re-entry parity, and that at this price and at the currently required level of fiat reserves, the stock of above ground gold is large enough to support the adoption of gold redeemability, although it would require a one-time outlay of $3.5 trillion. I also find that the costs of maintaining the gold standard would be $383 billion per year. However, both of these cost estimates decline substantially when using historically-realistic reserve ratios. The principle conclusion of my analysis is that returning to the gold standard would be feasible in the technical sense considered in this paper. There is more than enough gold to support the resumption of redeemability, and the costs of doing so are relatively small.

It also investigates whether the period preceding the 2007-2008 financial crisis had an impact on the portion of consumer revolving debt securitized by these institutions. It finds that more consumer revolving debt is securitized when cardholders’ credit conditions deteriorate; when credit card issuers face increasing losses due to cardholder default; when the spread between average credit card rate and the rate financial institutions pay to raise funds widens; and when the general financial and economic conditions worsen. The findings also suggest that financial institutions may have used asymmetric information to increase the portion of consumer revolving debt that they securitized in the years leading to the recent financial crises.,None,Securitization of revolving debt and its determinants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976918302771,27 March 2019,2019,Research Article,425.0

For the analysis, a linear state-space AR model with ==== and an augmented bivariate VAR asymmetric BEKK-GARCH model were adopted. The results reveal that only Hong Kong showed evidence of return transmission from the SME market to the main market. Controlling for the joint effects of the three factors considerably reduced the magnitude and significance level of this return transmission and, in essence, eliminates the volatility transmission. Moreover, Hong Kong’s main market return exhibited a causal relationship and a long-run equilibrium relationship with the country’s economic development. Therefore, the SME market arguably can make an indirect contribution to economic development in Hong Kong via its return transmission across the main market. Consequently, any policies that facilitate the development of the SME market in this country would promote long-term economic stimulation indirectly through its transmission mechanism with the main market.",None,Dynamic transmissions between main stock markets and SME stock markets: Evidence from tropical economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976918301686,23 March 2019,2019,Research Article,426.0

The constructed balance sheet comprises fixed-income items, stocks, deposits, and off-balance sheet items. The simulation model accounts for credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk including their interactions. Regarding bank liquidity risk, the model accounts for withdrawal risk in non-maturing deposits, the call-off risk of irrevocably committed credit lines and market price risk of assets. Our main results are summarized as follows: First, the introduction of LCR and NSFR has no unambiguous impact on bank's equity return and balance sheet growth. Second, the introduction of the liquidity ratios helps to reduce default risk. Third, it is more difficult for banks to comply with the ratios’ thresholds in macroeconomic stress scenarios than in other scenarios.
