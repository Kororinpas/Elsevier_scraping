The study concluded that the government's efforts to consolidate and improve public transport bus services could be well served by a BRT infrastructure over and above the existing bus network. Since then a public transport reform was implemented in 2011 ending a long held ==== of bus owners which controlled and operated inadequately the network of services, and introducing competitive tendering. Following many years of decline bus passenger numbers are now growing due to the recent economic development, influx of foreign workers and increased tourism. This study investigates the implementation of a BRT in the main island of Malta by looking at key socio-demographic and infrastructural determinants. It also lists some of the barriers to implementation. The aim of the paper is to provide a preliminary assessment of BRT implementation in an island context and propose research in support of such infrastructures in islands facing similar transport-related challenges as in Malta.","The high costs and negative impacts of many urban transport systems has been documented across a number of geographies. Small to large cities, at different stages of urbanisation and in different parts of the world, have increasingly fallen victim to an increase in car traffic, with the resulting challenges of system delays (congestion) and pollution, alongside other negative externalities. And whilst the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic provided a tiny window of opportunity to view cities without traffic and pollution (see Malpede & Percoco, 2020; Nieuwenhuijsen, 2021; Slezakova & Pereira, 2021), many urban areas are feeling once again the pressures of unsustainable transport systems creeping back in as the world eases out of the health restrictions imposed on travel and mobility. The INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard shows the many hours lost by car occupants to congestion across a number of cities. And whilst at the top of the list for 2021, drivers in cities like Paris (France) and London (UK) waste over 140 h to peak hour congestion, in cities like Lyon (France), Rome (Italy) and New York (US) over 100 h were lost per driver to congestion in 2021. Many other drivers in much smaller cities waste over 50 h in congestion (e.g. Medellin in Colombia; Liege in Belgium; Limerick in Ireland; Graz in Austria). In many of these cities, traffic is still affected by COVID-19, even though some are experiencing worst traffic conditions (INRIX, 2021). One study that looked at time lost in congestion in a small island context showed car drivers wasting up to 52 h a year (in 2012) in the small island state of Malta (Attard et al., 2015). According to INRIX (2021), another city in a small island recorded 20 h lost in congestion per driver in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Whilst Singapore (a similarly small island city state) reported a loss of 24 h.====Congestion affects cities and their populations in several ways. At the highest levels of governance, congestion affects economic activity and growth as well as impacts infrastructure provision and maintenance. It still affects pollution and climate change obligations, with cities increasingly finding difficulties to reach their carbon emission targets. Bjørgen and Ryghaug (2022) report on how the Norwegian cities of Oslo, Trondheim and Bodø are struggling to achieve their climate goals primarily because of congestion, attributed in this case to increasing goods deliveries. At a social level it affects health (Nieuwenhuijsen, 2021) and well-being and creates injustices such as social exclusion, urban space distribution, accidents and road safety for those most vulnerable (Attard, 2020; Vasconcellos, 2018). Over the years, and supported by mounting evidence, many cities have acknowledged the importance of a modal shift to more environmentally friendly and efficient transport systems, including the contribution of active travel in reaching climate goals (Brand et al., 2021) and the necessity of high-quality public transport to support mobility and economic activity with minimal impact on the environment and public health (Vajjarapu & Verma, 2022).====This paper looks at the case study of Malta, a European island state in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, and its struggles with the governance and management of public transport services, and investigates the potential for implementing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), in order to support increasing economic growth and mobility and to encourage the much-needed modal shift from high impact private means of transport to a more just and sustainable form of public transport. The study looks at secondary data to support the research, and reviews literature that examine islands and island transport systems.====This introductory section is followed by a brief literature review in Section 2. This is followed by a description of the case study of Malta and the islands’ recent transport systems development and governance in Section 3. In Section 4 the potential for BRT will be presented with a discussion on the supporting infrastructure measures necessary to avoid saturation and further the transition to “green” transport. Section 5 will extend the discussion on the challenges of adopting sustainable transport practices and policies, whilst Section 6 concludes the paper and provides an agenda for more research in this geographic context.",Planning for Bus Rapid Transit in an island context.

Gamification can be defined as the introduction of game design elements into non-game contexts (Deterding et al., 2011). TDM strategies with gamified design can provide positive incentives in the form of playing a game and providing rewards. Gamified design has recently been implemented for TDM strategies in the public transport field with some success. However, before implementing a TDM strategy with a gamified design, it is critical to understand how participants or users value the proposed strategy. This study explores which attitudes and perceptions make a gamified scheme successful in attracting users to participate. This study surveyed 160 participants in Taipei City and used structural equation modelling (SEM) with an extended technology acceptance model (extended TAM) to identify which user attitudes and perceptions are critical to influence respondents' intention to join the gamified scheme. This study finds the key element of ‘to capture the fun and joy’ of the gamified scheme or perceived enjoyment is positively related to perceived ease of use that is key in convincing people to participate as being perceived as easy to use means the target demographic feels no burden in “giving it a try”. The results of this study may aid policy makers in designing gamification schemes that are more tailored for the specific purpose and thus more effective.","Travel demand management (TDM) seeks to reduce travel demand, or to redistribute demand over time or to different locations. In recent years, many innovative TDM instruments have emerged, which use incentives to reduce or shift travel demand from private modes to public transport. Positive user incentives for TDM include policies such as fare discounts, loyalty rewards, and gamification. Fare discounts are often used to manage peak loading by providing cheaper off-peak fares. For example, the public transport system in Brisbane, Australia provides a 20% off-peak fare discount if passengers travel outside a defined peak period. However, peak loading issues still endure and a peak-in-the-peak travel pattern still persists (====). Therefore, policy makers or transport planners continue to seek more effective TDM strategies to address issues such as peak loading. Gamification has been gaining traction as an innovative non-traditional TDM policy. Gamification refers to the introduction of game design elements into non-game contexts (====:1).====The success of gamification schemes for TDM has only recently started to be explored. In public transport, previous research has shown that gamification is effective at reducing travel demand in peak hours, such as Singapore's INSINC program which successfully shifted 7.49% of peak demand to the off-peak period in a six-month research pilot in 2012 (====). INSINC was a fully designed scheme that was implemented with success with no pre-scheme investigation. However, ==== argued that, for every gamification scheme, there should be pre-scheme investigation to understand what elements or design factors can catch the attention of target users. For understanding behaviour intention, the attitudes and perceptions of potential target users are two key aspects to investigate (====; ====; ====; ====). Thus the main research question for this study is: which attitudes and perceptions toward a gamification scheme in public transport can significantly motivate the target user(s) to join and participate in the scheme?====To understand the effectiveness of gamification schemes at capturing potential users, this study uses a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to analyze the perceptions of potential users of gamified schemes with the aim of reducing public transport peak hour travel. The TAM captures users’ perceptions of, or attitudes to, new technologies with four measurements: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude and behavioural intention (====). However, other authors have used similar measurements, such as social norm (====) and cohesion (====). This study proposes a modified TAM, called an extended TAM, with eight measures: perceived security, social norm, perceived cohesion, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards playing, and behavioural intention. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data in 2021 in Taiwan. Participants were asked about their attitudes and perceptions to proposed schemes as well as their intention to participate. The analysis in this study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) for the extended TAM.====The paper is organised as follows. Section ==== reviews the literature of how gamification can be implemented in the transport field and presents an example of SEM and TAM in the field of gamification.

Recently, gamified interventions have been proposed as a better way to incentivise users to participate in TDM interventions. The concept of gamified design uses game design elements in non-game contexts. However, transport is complex and diverse and it is not clear whether gamified design is transferable between different transport applications such as increasing public transport use and improving road safety. The research question of this study is to investigate policy transfer effects of different gamified design applications. In order to explore this research question, this study designed two ==== surveys with the same gamified design concepts but applied in two fields, including public transport with the aim to relieve congestion and for young drivers with the aim to improve road safety. Both surveys are held in Queensland, Australia. A multinomial logit modelling approach was used for both case studies. The marginal effect results were cross compared to draw out policy implications and potential policy transfer effects. The paper concludes that some users' attitudes and perceptions are transferrable, and gamified schemes are not particularly favoured. In particular, it is clear that irrespective of transport field, the design of a scheme for vehicle users must understand participants’ intentions and that this is more important than capturing their beliefs.","Transport planners, policy makers and operators are constantly searching for low-cost solutions to transport problems, such as peak hour congestion, peak loading and road safety. Travel demand management (TDM) has long been implemented in transport to manage users’ behaviour, such as travel behaviour or driving behaviour (Gärling et al., 2002; Gärling & Schuitema, 2007; Meyer, 1999).====In order to motivate target users to change their behaviour, TDM schemes are typically presented as a package (Yen et al., 2019). In the early days, TDM was mainly used to decrease the demand for private vehicle use due to the presence of significant negative environmental impacts, such as congestion, noise, and air pollution (Gärling & Schuitema, 2007; Garling & Schuitema, 2007; Kitamura, Fujii, & Pas, 1997). Given the effectiveness of TDM in vehicle management, TDM has been implemented as a strategy package in multiple fields to address different travel behaviours, such as parking management (e.g., Petiot, 2004), traffic congestion relief (e.g., Logan, Nelson, Osbeck, Chapman, & Hastings, 2020), driving safety (e.g., Yen, Fu, & Chiou, 2022), public transport management (Yen et al., 2015, Yen, Mulley, Tseng, & Chiou, 2018). There are many types of TDM strategies. Gamified design has been widely used in non-game contexts, in the education field for example, because it has been viewed to be a more effective way to motivate behaviour change to achieve TDM goals. This paper aims to investigate the effect of gamified design in two transport fields, including public transport and young driver safety, to understand the potential policy transfer effect.====For public transport, peak hour traffic congestion and overloading problems are often the most pressing issues for urban transport agencies. The most common TDM strategy to address this issue is off-peak discounts. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, TransLink==== has a “go card” electronic ticketing system for public transport. Go cards allow passengers to travel on all TransLink bus, train, ferry and tram services in South East Queensland (SEQ). There are two go card TDM strategies: an off-peak discount policy, in which trips in off-peak periods receive an additional 20% saving off the standard go card fare, and a volume rebate policy, in which travellers who make eight paid journeys in a week (Monday to Sunday) travel for half price for the rest of the week.==== These two fare policies have a price discrimination strategy but for different purposes of reducing peak-hour travel demand and at the same time encouraging public transport use. Similar policies are applied in cities worldwide. There is long-standing research on differential fare policies (Glaister, 1974) and on service frequency adjustments (Jansson, 1993), capacity improvements (Arnott et al., 1993) and their efficacy. However, some research concludes that traditional TDM strategies only influence users’ behaviour with very limited effect. Yen et al. (2015) used go card data in Brisbane to evaluate the policy effects of the two TDM fare policies. They observed that, even with these two fare policies, there is still a “peak in the peak” travel pattern and suggested that traditional TDM strategies of an off-peak discount and volume rebate did not really have significant effects in this case.====To understand how to improve the efficacy of TDM strategies, recent studies have investigated how “attitudes” and “perceptions”, collectively known as “soft factors”, might increase the incentive for individuals to change their behaviour, especially their perceptions of the built environment (Aditjandra et al., 2012, 2013, 2015; Cao et al., 2007, 2009; Handy et al., 2005). The purpose of incorporating elements of attitudes and perceptions into TDM strategies is to make the strategies more attractive and acceptable, and thus effective. There is increasing literature that investigates the use of game elements in TDM strategies, known as gamification, often defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts (Deterding et al., 2011). The basic concept of gamification is to introduce composite elements and social activities into behavioural interventions so participants can become “players” by changing their behaviour and TDM policy goals can be achieved (Yen et al., 2019). Working real trials of gamification schemes can be found, such as INSINC in Singapore and Beat the street in the UK. More gamification schemes are still at the research stage. In this paper, the stated preference surveys present gamified or gaming elements to the specific contexts to respondents.====Previous studies have generally focused on two research areas in gamification: conceptual framework development (Deterding et al., 2011; Huotari & Hamari, 2017; Yen et al., 2019) and empirical case studies (Bittner & Shipper, 2014; Denny, 2013; Jones et al., 2014; Nelson, 2012; Rey et al., 2016). Yen et al. (2019) argued that before a gamification scheme is developed, several design perspectives should be addressed to understand how to develop appropriate incentives, whether these incentives should be pecuniary or non-pecuniary and how gamification might be framed for the transport context so interventions have a solid foundation of theory underpinning their design.====There are few cases of implementing gamified design in public transport and road safety fields. Singapore's INSINC program (====) can be viewed as one of the earliest trials of gamified design in public transport. This scheme has successfully shifted 7.49% peak demand for commuters in a six-month research pilot, which was launched on January 10, 2012. For road safety, several private insurance companies developed different gamified schemes (e.g., SDrive in Sydney in 2015). Some self-report results can be found. Take SDrive as an example reported “Over 3,000,000 safe kilometres have been travelled by users, with crashes in the region down by 25% and fatalities down by 20%====”. These results beg the question as to whether gamified design is transferable between different transport applications. This is the central policy issue addressed by this paper starting from the position that policy design is transferrable between different transport fields not least as it is common for different transport fields to have the same or similar groups of users. For example, high school students may be public transport users while also learning to become safe vehicle drivers. In this case, in school catchment areas, public transport and young driver safety issues might be highly related since they have a similar target group. A clear research gap can be identified: this is to identify how transferable a similar or identical gamified design is to different contexts and/or for different participants?====Previous studies have found that young generations have higher acceptance of gamified design (Yen et al., 2019). In order to understand how gamified design can motivate behaviour change in transport field, the objective of this paper is to investigate the policy transfer effect for TDM schemes with gamified design in two areas: public transport and road safety. The study designs two gamification schemes with stated preference (SP) surveys, with applications to public transport to relieve congestion and for young drivers to improve road safety in Queensland, Australia. In order to achieve this research aim, a multinomial logit modelling approach is Thused to investigate participants’ intention to participate in a gamified or incentive-based TDM scheme. Multinomial logit modelling is designed for the analysis of multiclass problems so as to predict the probabilities of a categorically distributed dependent variable that forms a set of independent variables (Greene, 2012). The study uses two different SP surveys that each have a different set of scheme choices that form the independent variables of a multinomial logit model. More detailed model and variable settings are introduced in section 4.====The paper is structured as follows: the next section provides the literature context to understand TDM in the transport field and policy transfer and how it can be measured and assessed. This discussion is followed by the introduction of the survey design for improving public transport use and road safety, and the study area. Then, the methodology used in this paper is outlined before providing results and interpretation. Policy transfer effects are discussed next. Finally, the paper concludes with policy implications.",Understanding the potential policy transfer of gamification schemes for behaviour change in public transport and road safety,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885923000392,23 May 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

For instance, ==== document global airline negative abnormal returns of 24.42% in the five days following the 11 march 2020 WHO declaration of a global pandemic outbreak.====Governments worldwide have taken various policy responses such as social distancing, school and workplace closures, travel bans, testing policies, and economic measures to stabilize the economy. Such restrictions on social and economic activities resulted in the global stock markets reacting much more forcefully to COVID-19 than to previous health crises (====). The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), developed by ====, has organized various types of policies and provided public datasets on (1) overall government response, (2) containment and health policy, (3) stringency policy, and (4) economic support policy. Tracking government policy responses around the globe offers an opportunity to explore the impact of the intervention on airline stocks worldwide.====Using this dataset, recent studies can investigate the role of government policy response to financial markets (====; ====, ====; ====, ====, ====, among others). However, they find mixed results. ==== find that the announcement of government COVID-19-related policies positively impacts G7 stock market returns. Similarly, ==== find that containment and health policies positively affect global stock market returns. ==== show that travel and leisure companies around the globe benefited from stringent containment and closure interventions. On the other hand, ==== finds that containment and closure measures adversely affect that containment and closure measures hurt international stock market returns. ====Although the literature finds a negative impact of growth in confirmed cases of COVID-19 on stock returns and a significant impact of COVID-19-related policies on financial markets, not much literature studies the moderating effects of government interventions on stock returns. For example, ==== discovers that the announcement of stringent government social distancing measures mitigates the stock market's negative response to the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition, existing literature limits their investigation to a few developed countries and analyzes data over a relatively short period (====; ====; ====). Therefore, research must be conducted on a more extended sample period. Moreover, literature on government response to transportation stock performance is scant and limited in a specific country. For example, ==== find that government policy responses alleviate the negative returns of listed Japanese shipping stocks.====To the best of our knowledge, there is yet to be a study of the impact of government response policies on the airline industry. To fill the gap mentioned above, we examine the effects of government response policies to COVID-19 on the weekly returns of airline companies worldwide. We use COVID-19 data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and government policy response data from ====. Our final dataset includes 73 publicly listed airlines from 36 countries, with the sample period spanning 48 weeks from January to December 2020.====We find that the overall government policies, containment and health policies, and stringency policies increase airline stock returns. Our results are in line with ====, ====, and ====. Containment and health policies and stringency policies also alleviate the negative effect of the pandemic airline stock returns through the reduction of COVID-19 confirmed cases. On the other hand, economic support policies do not significantly impact the returns and even strengthen the adverse effect. We posit that as people receive financial support from the government, they tend to be less concerned about the pandemic, leading to higher growth in confirmed cases. The government interventions' impact on airline stock returns is heterogeneous based on the headquarters but not on the airline's ownership structures and business operations.====Our study contributes to the existing literature in at least two ways.

However, this approach cannot measure the impact of land-use changes as residents and businesses relocate to take advantage of lower travel and/or freight costs resulting from the project.

This paper presents an application of VLUTI by looking at differences in the conventional transport benefits under both static and dynamic land use scenarios. In the static method, the land use in the project case is unchanged from the base case. In the dynamic case, the land use in the project case, at a future point in time, is endogenously adjusted within VLUTI. It presents a method to correct, in the dynamic case, the benefits as estimated by the rule of a half, which usually assumes static land use. The paper concludes with suggestions for further developments and improvements of VLUTI such as incorporating an activity-based transport model and an environmental model to progress toward an integrated land-use, transport, economy, and environment model capable of assessing the full impact of a transport project in a holistic way.","Governments around the world need to assess the benefits of transport projects to prioritize investment. It is imperative for governments to have tools that can closely estimate the actual benefits and impacts of investments in significant transport projects.====Traditionally, the benefits of a transport project have been estimated by using a transport model, assuming fixed land use for the base and project case in the future. However, this approach cannot measure the impact of land use change as residents and businesses relocate to take advantage of lower travel and/or freight costs resulting from the project. Consequently, the benefits of the project may be under or overestimated, depending on its position within the transport system, and how the project would potentially reshape land use patterns in the future. To overcome this drawback, Infrastructure Victoria, in close collaboration with Victoria University, Arup, and AECOM, led the development of the Victorian Land Use and Transport Integration model (VLUTI), which was used for the strategic assessment of major transport programs included in ==== (Infrastructure Victoria, 2021a).====Section 2 presents a literature review of developments in the land-use transport interaction (LUTI) model. The review focuses on a branch of the land-use model, the spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE), which brings in not only the location choice but also the economic aspect of land use. This led to the formation of VLUTI by combining the Spatial Interactions Within and Between Regions and Cities in Victoria (SIRCV) model, an SCGE model with the Victorian Integrated Transport Model (VITM). Section 2 also highlights our contributions to the estimation of land use changes benefits.====Section 3 presents an overview of VLUTI. Section 4 discusses the methodology of the VITM.

Results show that users' characteristics of flexible transport are contrastingly different in urban and rural areas; and that this method represents an effective tool to capture the economic and social benefits for FTS users. This study posits that tangible evidence is not enough to evaluate and assess FTS schemes and points out that a careful understanding of the FTS user's benefits is needed to assess the effectiveness of FTS. These findings contribute to a better understanding of flexible transport implementation and provide evidence for FTS scheme proponents and transport funders.,"Flexible transport services (FTS) are progressively being implemented and are attractive because they provide a service customized to users. This is especially relevant because FTS provides a solution for users with mobility disadvantages (Nelson et al., 2017); represents an alternative to conventional public transport in locations where a fixed route service is expensive (Mageean & Nelson, 2003); and is an effective complement for other transport modes, e.g. for first/last mile connections to mainstream public transport (Ryley et al., 2014). Despite its many benefits there are issues with the evaluation of FTS schemes which are discussed below.====Although there is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive evaluation of flexible transport (see, for example, Alonso-González et al. (2018); Grunicke et al. (2021)), most previous studies have focused on the evaluation of the ==== of flexible transport. These studies use performance measures of FTS (see for example TCRP (2008)) but the post evaluation of an implemented flexible transport scheme in terms of wider benefits have received less attention. This might be due to limitations of individual case studies where contextual factors are difficult to replicate. Nevertheless, the impact of flexible transport schemes and the contributing variables to the patronage of FTS have remained largely unstudied.====This study asks how we can understand the relationships between patronage and the users’ characteristics in FTS schemes in urban and rural areas. To answer this question this study associates spatial datasets, namely the operational data from the transport provider, with the Australian Census data (ABS, 2016) using QGIS software. This association allow us to describe the relationships between patronage with economic and social variables collected in the Census. In addition, we developed a statistical model to explore how the service characteristics influence patronage in urban and rural FTS schemes.====This paper is organized as it follows; we begin by describing the method and the statistical model together with the selected FTS schemes characteristics and location. This is followed by the results of the datasets association describing the inferred economic and social benefits for FTS users. We conclude with a discussion of the study, limitations and areas for future research.","Factors influencing the patronage of flexible transport in urban and rural areas.

The results reveal that individuals who care more about timeliness and quality are less sensitive to price, more sensitive to time, and more likely to opt for a nonstop alternative. Additionally, the value assigned to handled connections is considerable (higher for anxious travelers).","The planning and development of air transport networks is a challenging and multi-stage task that heavily relies on advanced predictive and prescriptive analytics to make optimal decisions. A key input to the planning process is the estimation of air travel demand. In this domain, increasing attention has been devoted to the capturing of passenger behavior so as to anticipate and possibly address competitive dynamics. Literature and practice mostly rely on discrete choice modeling to mirror itinerary choice by passengers as a function of key supply-related variables—such as price, flight time, routing, and departure time preferences (Garrow, 2016). These variables are partly under control of airlines in structuring their networks and pricing control algorithms. Hence, anticipating how passengers will react to changes in the level of supply, and conditional upon the offering by competing airlines, is paramount. This is even more important in complex networks where self-competition dynamics and shared supply among overlapping itineraries operated by the same company exist (Birolini, Besana, Cattaneo, Redondi, & Sallan, 2022). Moreover, having a demand model that captures the trade-offs and substitution patterns between demand and air travel services is key for policy-making and authorities aiming to assess the impact of network changes from a societal perspective and drive their sustainable/welfare-oriented development.====Despite established models bring strong evidence on macro-factors affecting passenger allocation (e.g., on the magnitude of price elasticities and average value of times), the ongoing changes of the industry—including changes in the passenger mix, their attitudes and perceptions toward air traveling, and business models—require a continuous (re-)assessment of model coefficients to effectively drive decision-making.====Our paper contributes to the literature on itinerary choice in three major ways. First, it develops a tailored stated preference survey to investigate key trade-off(s) between level-of-service and connection quality attributes, while considering a novel feature, that is, whether connecting itineraries are actively marketed and handled by an airline or not—as in the case of self-hubbing, where passengers arrange their trip, bearing the risk of misconnection and the burden of undergoing repeated security screening—and explore its impact on different lengths of haul. The focus on handled vs. self-connect itineraries is motivated by the recent hybridization of airline business models, under which low-cost carriers (LCCs) have started to exploit their extensive network of flights to provide attractive connections and possibly increase their profits. Despite the topic having spurred numerous studies in the last 15 years (see, e.g., Fageda et al., 2015, Klophaus et al., 2012, Maertens et al., 2016, Malighetti et al., 2008, Morlotti et al., 2020), to our knowledge, there is no study to date that empirically investigates the demand potential of self-hubbing itineraries and the premium of integrated transfer services. Nonetheless, this is key to support decision-making on connection planning by LCCs (Birolini et al., 2022) and makes one of the key intended contributions of this paper.====Second, this work implements an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by a latent class choice model (LCCM). The factors identified in the EFA, i.e., ==== and ==== are included in the LCCM model as features determining class membership (along with demographic determinants, such as age and gender) and are found to significantly affect passenger preferences toward connecting itineraries.====Third, we focus specifically on millennials, that is, individuals born between the early 1980s and early 2000s. Millennials are recognized as one of the largest traveling population segment and, at the same time, they exhibit a different travel behavior and to make different transport choices compared to past generations (Delbosc et al., 2019, Delbosc and Ralph, 2017, Garikapati et al., 2016), making them worthy of investigation.====Ultimately, this study contributes to advancing knowledge around air itinerary choice behavior and bringing novel insights regarding new business models underpinning the current evolution of the sector.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the current literature on travel choices. Sections 3 Survey design, 4 Methodology detail the research design and the methodology of our work.

Thus, the evaluation of public transport operations is usually based on financial analysis, which leads to decision-making on service supply depending on whether it is profitable. As depopulation escalates in rural areas of Japan, the number of public transport users has declined, and suppliers have reduced their local businesses. The decline in public transport in rural areas has resulted in a lack of mobility for residents, particularly for the transport disadvantaged.====However, mobility, that is the ability of people to move from one location to another, is essential for people's quality of life. Lack of mobility increases the risk of social exclusion, resulting in various social consequences, such as undermining the cohesion of society, which has been widely discussed since the 1990s (Social Exclusion Unit, 2003; Levitas et al., 2007; Stanley et al==== 2011). Social exclusion is described as people feeling it is difficult or impossible to participate in society, specifically in social activities and networks, due to poor mobility (Kenyon et al., 2003; Stanley et al==== 2011). From this viewpoint, public transport as a low-cost transport option to maintain people's mobility can be considered as a factor affecting people's social connections.====The concept of social capital, popularized by Putnam in the 1990s, reflects social dimensions and refers to trust, norms, and social networks (Putnam, 1993). Individuals who are embedded in rich social connections, namely, those with rich social capital, are regarded as having a lower risk of being socially excluded (Currie & Stanley, 2008; Stanley et al==== 2011). In this context, social capital can be used to evaluate the social benefits of public transport. In other words, public transport can be expected to provide more than just economic benefits, as it enables people to move around and build social connections, thereby contributing to the social capital building. However, there is little empirical evidence linking public transport to social capital.====This study aims to examine the relationship between public transport and social capital using a quantitative method using municipal data and attempts to provide implications for public transport policy in rural areas of Japan.====This paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 summarizes the literatures on public transport and social capital. The research framework, including data and variables, is outlined in Section 3.

However, the spatial variation of the impacts of both walking and cycling accessibility and the influence of urban structure on housing submarkets are often overlooked in existing studies. This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the impacts of eight types of AT accessibility, inherent and locational attributes on housing prices in polycentric and monocentric cities. Geographically weighted regression models were estimated using housing price data from 3496 communities in Shanghai (a monocentric city) and 1100 communities in Wuhan (a polycentric city), China. The results illustrate the spatially varying impacts of AT accessibility on housing prices and highlight the existence of housing submarkets within cities due to varying factors such as urban structure, job-housing imbalance, consumer demand, public and private investment, and residential self-selection process. These findings provide valuable insights for investing in residential properties and designing policies and projects to improve AT accessibility in a way that promotes equity.","Active transportation (AT), also known as “non-motorized transportation”, is often defined as transporting people and/or goods through human physical activity. It primarily includes walking and cycling, and can also include modes such as rowing, skateboarding, kick scooters, and roller skates. It serves as a cheap and flexible door-to-door travel option that can be beneficial to both individual travelers and society. From the individual perspective, using AT can potentially promote physical activities, improve travel flexibility, and relieve congestion-related stress compared to using motorized transportation (e.g., cars and transit) (Grabow et al., 2019). This may contribute to the improvement of both physical and mental health, such as reducing the likelihood of having cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and improving happiness and well-being (Celis-Morales et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2022; Kelly et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015). It also improves the accessibility of billions of travelers around the world to various opportunities and services, particularly for those who may find motorized transportation less flexible or affordable (Guo & Peeta, 2020). From the societal perspective, promoting AT-based travel can lead to a mode shift away from motorized modes resulting in decreased greenhouse gas emissions, lowered automobile dependency, decreased traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased community cohesion (Alfonsin et al., 2019; Maizlish et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2015). The COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the need for AT in some regions as neighborhood lockdown is becoming the norm in many cities to combat virus spread and various types of restrictions were introduced related to mass transit usage to promote mode shift to AT (Guo et al., 2021a, 2021b). Many people without cars or who cannot afford to use ridesharing services rely on AT to commute and access basic services (Guo et al., 2021a, 2021b). Hence, the quality of AT of a community plays a key role in renters' and potential buyers' residential location decision-making process which is reflected by its positive relationship with the community's housing price in most existing related literature (Espada & Luk, 2011, pp. 55–66; Guo et al., 2016; Litman, 2003; Yang et al., 2018, 2022).====AT accessibility is one of the most widely used measurement to quantify AT of a community as it is a relative term and measures a community's access to the total number of potential opportunities and services using AT compared to other communities in the region. AT accessibility, along with the inherent property attributes (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, and built year), the locational attributes (e.g., the distance to the central business district, transportation hub, and water body), and public taxes and services, collectively determine the housing price (Guo et al., 2018; Redfearn, 2009). The impacts of AT accessibility on property price can be even greater in large cities, particularly in the global south where AT plays a more prominent role in daily travel (Guo et al., 2020; Jamal et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021). Therefore, various types of strategies have been developed to improve AT accessibility such as constructing AT facilities and improving AT safety, and to uplift the value and attractiveness of the communities. However, most existing studies have focused on car-based, transit-based, and walking-based accessibility, while cycling-based accessibility has often been overlooked. In many developing countries and those with a strong cycling culture, cycling plays a critical role in people's daily travel due to its affordability, convenience, and environmental sustainability (Liu et al., 2022). Additionally, it serves as a complementary mode of transportation to urban public transit as a “first-and-last-mile” option, and the development of bike-sharing services further promotes this integration. A recent study showed that 54% of bike-share users used shared bikes to connect to other modes of transportation, and 91% of rides were used to connect to public transportation (Li, Hu, & Shen, 2019). The emergence of COVID-19 has further highlighted the importance of cycling-based accessibility as many public transportation services experienced a sharp drop in ridership, and many travelers changed their travel behavior towards cycling, even after the pandemic (Guo et al., 2021a, 2021b). Therefore, it is important to consider the impacts of cycling accessibility on housing price.====Despite the aforementioned benefits of the improved community AT accessibility, it can be a double-edged sword for many communities due to its negative impacts on housing affordability and equity, particularly for low-income households (Bouzouina et al., 2021). The increased AT accessibility in a community may lead to the influx of more affluent residents and businesses resulting in an increase in housing price and rent. Many of the low-income families may already be limited in their housing, job, and service options, and suffer from long commute time. Such improvement projects may drive them further away from these “improved” communities they used to live to locations with lower AT accessibility or force them to spend additional money on housing. This may result in additional daily commute cost and financial burdens which can likely further limit their housing, job, and service options leading to reduced equity (Bohman, 2021; Nilsson & Delmelle, 2018). Such a process, also known as gentrification, was observed in metropolises around the world.====The unique economic and political environment in China may further complicate the already complex impacts of AT accessibility on housing price and equity. The economic boom and the relaxation of the household registration system (as known as “hukou” system) lead to the largest population migration and fastest urbanization process in the past few decades with millions of people migrated from rural villages to coastal cities for higher income and more opportunities (Yusuf & Saich, 2008). The rapid increase in urban population, coupled with resource limitations, has led to an uneven distribution of resources, contributing to spatially varying housing price. In cities with a monocentric spatial structure, such as Shanghai and Beijing, housing price tend to decrease with increasing distance from the CBD, due to the centralization of employment opportunities and public services. These cities exhibit concentric rings of residential differentiation, where the high-income group can afford expensive privatized houses in the urban core with abundant public services, while migrants and low-income groups mostly reside in the peripheral areas (Han & Qin, 2009; Li, Wei, & Wu, 2019). In some Chinese cities, such as Hangzhou and Wuhan, polycentric urban development is emerging during the transitional economy (Wen & Tao, 2015; Yang et al., 2020). The construction of multiple specialized sub-centers or possible natural barriers is driving the formation of several housing submarkets. The organization of economic activity and the structure of urban form between these two types of cities can be very different. As more cities consider making a transition from monocentric to polycentric urban forms, it is important to expand our understanding of the relationship between residential property value and its influencing factors beyond just monocentric cities, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This study represents one of the earliest efforts to study the potential relationships between residential property value and its influencing factors in both monocentric and polycentric cities. By analyzing these relationships in both types of cities, we can gain insights into the unique features of each urban form and the factors that contribute to the spatially varying housing price in each type of city. These insights can be used to inform policy decisions and help guide urban development towards more equitable and sustainable outcomes. Hence, city's urban structure may significantly affect AT accessibility distribution and its impacts on housing price as it is directly related to land use distribution. However, most existing studies (i) focused on the impacts of transit and automobile accessibility on housing price but rarely highlight the impacts of AT accessibility, except for some walking accessibility-related studies, (ii) concentrated on studying the impacts in developed countries with limited effort to capture these unique impacts in developing countries such as China, and (iii) have yet to provide a comprehensive understanding on the spatial variation of AT accessibility's impacts on housing price within a city or among cities with different urban structures.====This study seeks to investigate the impacts of AT accessibility to various facilities along with other factors on second-hand housing price and understand their spatial varying nature within and between two cities, Shanghai (a monocentric city) and Wuhan (a polycentric city), China. Through this comparison between cities, this study aims to explore potential influence of urban structure on the formation of housing submarkets. Through this comparison between cities, this study aims to explore potential influence of urban structure on the formation of housing submarkets. 16 possible influencing factors belonging to three categories (houses’ inherent attributes, AT accessibility, and other locational attributes) of over 3000 communities in Shanghai and 1000 communities in Wuhan were collected. These communities represent all the communities within these cities having at least 1 s-hand house available for sale throughout December 2021. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were estimated for each city to capture the impacts of these influencing factors on housing price and the possible spatial correlations among them. Statistical analysis and model estimation results highlight the spatial varying impacts of these factors on housing price and their potential differences between polycentric and monocentric cities. The study insights can be used to design future AT accessibility improvement projects and policies and facilitate effective resource and investment allocation to promote equitable AT transportation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the previous studies related to AT accessibility quantification and influencing factors of housing price. After that, the methodology used for AT accessibility quantification and GWR models is presented in Section 3, followed with discussion of the study region and data collection process in Section 4.

Using ==== models with variable mode share, in a circular structure with radial lines, optimal fares for bus services were estimated for 33 small and medium-sized cities in Chile. Through a linear regression model, we determined that the optimal fares decrease for cities with higher population, lower average income, a higher proportion of students, and with a CBD surrounded by natural boundaries such as seacoast.

Because they are not ====-based models, they are doubted for their ability to forecast well. The rise of machine learning techniques has given researchers tools to build better predictive models, and the tools to evaluate predictiveness. Extensive previous work in the statistics and machine learning field has shown that the best predictive model is not synonymous with the most ==== (or explanatory) model. The non-motorized demand modeling community could leverage these lessons learned to develop better count-based predictive models.====The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly affected travel patterns, and the broad data collection has opened-up an opportunity to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive bicycle demand model. This study uses bicycle count data, COVID-19 data, and weather data to develop a LASSO regression model for three facilities in Austin, TX. The COVID-19 variables included both state- and local-level data between March 15, 2020, and January 31, 2021. The final model selects six variables out of 28 variables and reveals that the increase of statewide COVID-19 fatalities, statewide molecular positivity rate, and local precipitation cause a decrease in bike ridership, meanwhile maximum temperature causes an increase. The LASSO model also has a lower prediction MSE during cross validation compared to the full model. This paper aims to bring to light that our present-day demand and volume forecasting efforts would benefit tremendously from a predictive modeling approach rather than valuing the most explanatory models as the only strong forecasters of demand. In the end, modelers can use this approach to improve the forecasting ability of any count-based bicycle demand model.","The pandemic has been a catalyst for cities to invest more toward equitable, healthy, and sustainable transportation options, like bicycling and walking. At the start of the pandemic, the CDC labeled public transportation as high risk for contracting and spreading the COVID-19 virus, and bicycling and walking as an overall low risk activity (====; ====). A study conducted by People for Bikes highlights that the US saw a surge in bicycling rates in 2020 across all demographics and approximately 200 cities responded by changing street functionality to accommodate the increased outdoor activity (====). Planning efforts seeking to implement bicycle facilities must accurately predict bicycle ridership to maximize project benefits. Predicting future bicycle demand helps decision-makers pick appropriate facilities and prioritize projects according to benefit/cost ratios. In the end, having an ==== demand forecasting model can save planners money in construction costs, maximize health and safety benefits for users, and facilitate decision-making. Traditionally, count-based demand models have been doubted for their ability to predict bicycle ridership for various reasons, including their lack of connection to direct causal factors, but they are widely used in practice (====).====Previous research in machine learning has taught us that the model that best represents the data-generating process is not necessarily the most predictive (====; ====). In general, transportation demand estimation has almost always only focused on choice-based models because it seems that prediction would require explanation. However, machine learning has shown how a model that fails to capture all causal mechanisms can outperform a more complex, more accurate model in terms of prediction (====; ====) because of a phenomenon known as ====. With increasing access to data and data collection methods, count-based demand models could become very powerful predictive tools by implementing this lesson learned in machine learning. This paper aims to bring to light that our present-day demand and volume forecasting efforts would benefit tremendously from a predictive modeling approach rather than valuing the most explanatory models as the only strong forecasters.====Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, state, local, and territorial health departments have been collecting case data that can be leveraged to help predict bicycle volumes. To understand which COVID-19 variables are best at predicting bicycle ridership, this paper uses a machine learning method called LASSO regression. For this study, the variables considered for building a predictive model are COVID-19 case data, vaccination data, government ordinances (city and state level), and weather.

To encourage private firms' participation, the government usually provides them with demand guarantee. This paper investigates and compares the optimal BOT contracts with the minimum demand guarantee (MDG) and the flexible demand guarantee (FDG), respectively, in environments of symmetric and asymmetric information. It is determined that under the MDG with asymmetric information, the private firm's optimal effort decreases with respect to the guarantee level, which indicates that the MDG provides the private firm with a ==== to exert effort to increase traffic demand. Under the FDG with asymmetric information, the private firm's optimal effort decreases with respect to the guarantee level and threshold coefficient. Through a comparison of the environment with asymmetric information, the optimal toll price, optimal guarantee level and resulting social welfare are higher under the FDG for a small threshold coefficient. Therefore, it is concluded that the government may choose the FDG instead of the MDG for a small threshold coefficient, which means that the FDG is suitable for toll roads with relatively low demand. Conversely, the government prefers to choose the MDG instead of the FDG when the threshold coefficient is large enough, which means that the MDG is suitable for toll roads with relatively high demand. We further demonstrate that our model results still qualitatively hold when traffic congestion is considered.","The build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme has been frequently employed in toll road projects. In a typical BOT road project, the private firm is responsible for project financing, construction, and operation for many years, and then the road is transferred to the government. In return, the private firm is granted the right to charge users a reasonable toll price within the concession period. It has been recognized that the BOT model enables efficient project delivery, improved service quality and reduced financial burden for the government (Brandao & Saraiva, 2008; Li et al., 2005).====BOT toll road projects typically have a long operating period and face high demand uncertainty. Flyvbjerg et al. (2005) examined 210 transport infrastructure projects in 14 countries and pointed out that demand forecasts are overestimated in 90% of rail projects and that the actual demand deviates from the forecasted demand by more than 20% in 50% of road projects. Demand uncertainty may lead to the failure of BOT transport projects and become the main obstacle of private firms' participation. Albalate and Bel (2009) suggested that a private firm would suffer financial difficulties if the actual traffic is significantly lower than the expected traffic. To mitigate demand risk and encourage private firms’ participation in toll road projects, the government usually offers the fixed minimum demand guarantee (MDG) in a BOT contract. Under the MDG, the government guarantees a minimum demand level and compensates the private firm for unrealized traffic demand when the actual demand is below the guarantee level. In practice, the MDG exists in many BOT transport projects, such as the Hong Kong Cross-Harbour Tunnel (Tam, 1999), Metro Line 4 of the São Paulo Subway System (Brandão et al., 2012) and Beijing Metro Line 4 (Chang, 2013), to reduce the demand risk faced by private firms.====Although the MDG is an effective way to attract private firms' participation, it has also caused controversy for many years. Wibowo (2004) indicated that the MDG can reduce risks but is not free of costs. Feng et al. (2015) investigated the impacts of the MDG on toll charges as well as road quality and capacity and suggested that imposing the MDG could increase toll charges while decreasing road quality. Song et al. (2018) proposed that a higher MDG level could significantly reduce social welfare. Under the MDG, the government needs to guarantee all unrealized demand and assume full demand risk. In particular, a high MDG level makes the private firm receive a high revenue without risks and, as a result, reduces the private firm's effort to improve traffic demand.====To overcome the pitfalls of the MDG and fairly allocate demand risk between the government and private firms, the flexible demand guarantee (FDG) has been proposed, under which the government assumes limited liability and compensates only the private firm for a portion of the unrealized traffic demand. Different from the MDG, which is a rigid guarantee contract, the advantage of the FDG is that the government can transfer partial demand risks to private firms by setting a critical guarantee level, which means that the government will subsidize the private firm based on the realized demand states. Specifically, if the actual traffic demand is lower than the critical guarantee level, then the private firm assumes the loss of operating revenue that is incurred by the insufficient demand. Therefore, to avoid this loss, the private firm has incentives to exert more efforts to improve traffic demand beyond the critical guarantee level. As a result, the government only needs to undertake a smaller guarantee expenditure. The FDG has already been analyzed in the supply chain literature (Lariviere, 2002; Tsay, 1999; Tsay & Lovejoy, 1999). However, its application in a BOT toll road has not been noted by scholars, and how to choose between the MDG and the FDG remains unclear. Although the FDG helps to achieve a relatively fairer risk allocation between the government and private firms, it is not certain whether such a fairer risk allocation will enable a higher social welfare by encouraging the private firm to exert additional effort.====Some studies on demand guarantee in BOT projects exist (Feng et al., 2015; Song et al., 2018; Wibowo, 2004). However, these studies tend to consider the guarantee level exogenous and are unable to evaluate the rationality of the demand guarantee level and the effectiveness of its incentive effect on the private firm's effort. In addition, it is very common in the literature to implicitly assume that the government and the private firm have symmetric information in forecasting future demand (Feng et al., 2016; Niu & Zhang, 2013; Tan et al., 2010; Tan & Yang, 2012a). This finding may be true when the accumulated demand data from previous projects cannot be applied to the current project or both the government and the private firm lack demand forecast experience. However, in practice, the government and the private firm may possess different information about future demand.====Different from the aforementioned studies, this paper makes the demand guarantee level endogenous and aims to compare the role of the MDG and FDG under both symmetric information and asymmetric information to determine which guarantee type should be preferred by the government. In particular, we investigate how to simultaneously determine the guarantee level and other important contract variables from the perspective of maximizing social welfare under the two guarantee types. Moreover, to further explore the incentive effect of demand guarantee, we take into account the impact of the private firm's effort on traffic demand instead of assuming that the demand is only price-dependent. With this assumption, we investigate how the optimal guarantee level, toll price, and subsidy vary with the private firm's effort.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 presents some basic assumptions and notations. Section 4 investigates the optimal incentive contract with the MDG. Section 5 investigates the optimal incentive contract with the FDG.

A notable change has been remote working away from the main office with much of this occurring from home. Recognising that not all jobs can support working from home (WFH), the ability to do so to some extent is now seen as a legitimate alternative to commuting to the traditional workplace for many workers, with much of the prior stigma evaporating as a result of the relatively productive experience. Since March 2020 when the pandemic took hold and Australia went into lockdown, initially for an unknown period, we recognised a need to start tracking the changes that were expected to unfold as many individuals and households entered an unexplored option to WFH.

We incorporated door-to-door ==== and ticket price by public transit into a generalized travel cost function to measure utility-based accessibility following a log-sum formulation. Then, this study designed a Palma ratio of accessibility and a neighboring accessibility gap index to respectively examine the collective spatial equity and individual spatial equity of public transit. Finally, we took an empirical case of Kunming city, China to analyze the unity-based accessibility distribution and checked collective and individual spatial equity levels reaching business centers, transport hubs, and 3-A hospitals. The results show that the utility-based accessibility reaching transport hubs by public transit is less than 50% to business centers and 32% to 3-A hospitals. Collectively, the expected minimum generalized travel cost by public transit in the poorest 40% of traffic analysis zones is almost 2.5 times as much as in the richest 10% of traffic analysis zones, and the collective spatial equity in old blocks is superior to new blocks. Individually, the number of traffic analysis zones with no spatial inequity, slight inequity, and medium inequity in public transit accessibility respectively occupied almost 57%, 38%, and 5%. We also found individual spatial equity may be associated with the walking distance during taking public transit and the number of neighboring traffic analysis zones.","Promoting equitable development of public transport system in the aspect of social equity (Behbahani et al., 2018; Grengs, 2013) and spatial equity (Delmelle & Casas, 2012; Kelobonye et al., 2019) has become a primary agenda for traffic planners and city engineers. Especially, public transit has been an essential role to provide necessary access to social activities for low-income people without cars for a long time (Ignaccolo et al., 2016; Nahmias-Biran et al., 2013; Stanley & Lucas, 2008). Many cities have been aware of the impact of transportation projects (Nahmias-Biran et al., 2013; Niehaus et al., 2016) and transportation plans (Behbahani et al., 2018; Camporeale et al., 2016) on equity in different aspects, and they attempt to advocate the equity-oriented transport development for enhancing public transport services (R. J. Lee et al., 2016; Oswald Beiler & Mohammed, 2016). Therefore, planning an equitable public transport system has potential benefits for the sustainable and inclusive development of urban mobility (Wang et al., 2019).====In the last decade, researchers have devoted significant attention to exploring the concepts and measurements of equity in public transit. However, it is more difficult to measure transit equity than to understand one since the principle of equity remains sophisticated and diverse. There are three basic categories of transit equity: horizontal equity, vertical equity, and spatial equity in the existing literature. Litman (2012) developed horizontal equity and vertical equity with income and social class, and Ricciardi et al. (2015) discussed vertical equity with mobility demand and ability. Meanwhile, several studies attempted to apply the gap of accessibility to identify the difference in transportation benefits distributed in spatial units, which was usually called spatial equity (Kelobonye et al., 2019; Martens et al., 2012). As far as assessment methods of transportation equity are concerned, their principles and measures both remain unclear. There is no doubt that these proposed methods based on different equitable principles may exert some bias when evaluating horizontal equity, vertical equity, and others (Golub & Martens, 2014; Martens et al., 2012).====In previous works, accessibility has been a prevalent tool to examine the spatial equity level in public transit accessibility. The most common research paradigm concerning accessibility-based equity measures is as follows. To begin with, the travel time by public transit will be estimated as accurately as possible based on a Geographic Information System (Tahmasbi & Haghshenas, 2019; Yang et al., 2017). Then, a mathematical model (such as the gravity model, utility model, space-time model, and opportunity model) is developed to compute public transit accessibility considering main trip purposes (Ben-Elia & Benenson, 2019; Hansen, 2007; Kelobonye et al., 2019; L. Li et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). Finally, the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient are used to measure equity level (Lucas et al., 2015; Ricciardi et al., 2015; Welch, 2013). Table 1 summarizes related studies on public transit accessibility-based equity measures in the last four years. In these studies, transit modes involved common bus and metro modes.====Recent developments in public transit accessibility-based equity measures concentrated on the following four aspects. First, in the aspect of public transit accessibility measures, travel time has become the most prevalent indicator for accessibility formulation. Most researchers are used to developing a direct function or composite function of travel time to measure public transit accessibility. Second, main three types of concerning equity measure indicators have been widely used, including several economical indexes (such as the Theil index, Paloma ratio, Lorenz curves, Gini index, and average consumer surplus), statistical indicators (such as Getis-Ord statistic and local indicators of spatial association) and self-proposed indicators (such as accessibility sufficiency index, travel time gap/ratio). Third, in terms of equity types, most existing studies have been mainly focused on the collective equity level. This is, these studies are devoted to taking the above equity measure indicators to examine whether public transit accessibility is equitable for a population group or a region. Fourth, about citizens' trip purposes, accessibility-based equity related to workplaces, dining, and healthcare has been usually checked.====Although extensive research has been carried out on public transit accessibility-based equity formulations, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited research that investigates spatial equity levels in public transit accessibility both collectively and individually in a multimodal transit network. Therefore, this study is motivated to address the identified research niche, and the following contributions are made.====The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the proposed model, including generalized travel cost function, utility-based accessibility measure, individual spatial equity measure, and collective spatial equity level. Section 3 conducts an empirical case in Kunming city to examine the spatial equity level of public transit accessibility and its associated factors.

Both modules are parametrized with data derived from a discrete choice survey of potential users (N = 449) representative of the population living in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, an Italian region bordering with Austria and Slovenia. We specified the rental rate as a dynamic variable that varies according to the excess of demand or supply. Innovation and imitation effects change the status of car owners and car drivers into potential P2PCS users. According to our simulations the P2PCS market would reach a steady state at a rental rate of 6.1 €/h with 7% of car owners and car renters engaging in the system. We also found that if the preferences for the servitization paradigm were more diffused, P2PCS would be used by 11% of the population at a rental rate of 5.5 €/h, and that adopting a package of highly effective policies supporting both the demand and the supply would increase the market share up to 42%.","Local air pollution and congestion are major concerns in European urban areas. One fifth of the EU-28 population lives in cities with problems related to pollution or other environmental issues. The 2021 Global Traffic Scorecard estimates an average of 140 h lost in traffic congestion over the year in Paris, 134 in Brussels, and 106 in Rome. The European Green Deal adopted by the European Commission aims at a climate-neutral economy by 2050, calling for a 90% reduction in transport emissions and a shift to sustainable and smart mobility.====Carsharing (CS) has proven to reduce car ownership (Jain et al., 2021; Jochem et al., 2020; 2021; Shaheen, Martin, & Hoffman-Stapleton, 2021), distance travelled (Cohen & Shaheen, 2016, pp. 1–106; Dill et al., 2019; Martin, 2016; Shaheen et al., 2017, p. 162) and greenhouse gas emissions (Harris et al., 2021), and can significantly improve the sustainability of urban transport systems.====Mobility is fundamental for social inclusion and human well-being, especially for disadvantaged groups (EU_COM, 2021). Low-income segments of the population living in suburbs or rural areas face lower access to labor market and social and cultural activities due to low car ownership and poor public transport services and could highly benefit from CS services (Cohen & Shaheen, 2016, pp. 1–106; Cui & Aziz, 2019; Schwieterman & Smith, 2020). However, CS is a viable solution as long as it is provided in densely populated areas, otherwise is not financially sustainable.====Global consumer spending in shared-mobility services accounted for approximately $130 billion to $140 billion in 2019.==== Peer-to-peer car sharing (P2PCS) is an innovative form of sharing mobility with negligible start-up and operating costs since car owners and renters are peers and share the privately owned vehicles through a platform. Compared to the traditional business-to consumer carsharing (B2CCS) service, it is less capital intensive, therefore is potentially more scalable to less dense cities and suburban areas (Hampshire & Sinha, 2011).====The P2PCS model is gaining high popularity, representing 25% of the worldwide carsharing market share in 2020 (Global Market Insights, 2021), and is expected to gain additional momentum by 2024 due to its higher cost-effectiveness compared to station-based and free-floating B2CCS models (Graphical Research, 2021). In Italy Auting was the first P2PCS provider who started the business in 2017 and was followed by few newcomers such as Popmove, GetMyCar, I-Link. However, this form of CS has not reached a significant critical mass, yet, being offered especially in the largest cities of the northern part of the country.====Our goal is to predict the percentage of the population that would use the service and the rental rate that would be paid taking into account the innovation and the imitation effect and the potential impact of a package of transport policies supporting both the demand and the supply side of the market. To this aim, we performed a simulation analysis based on a Bass diffusion agent-based model including both a demand and a supply module. Both modules are based on an empirical survey involving a sample representative of the population living in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (FVG), an Italian region bordering with Austria and Slovenia. We interviewed 200 individuals to test if they would rent a car from a peer and 249 car owners to test if they would rent out their car to a peer. We studied the socio-economic characteristics and the psychological barriers influencing the potential demand and supply side of the market and used the estimates to feed the Bass diffusion agent-based model.====We validated the model comparing the outcome of a base case scenario with the market share and the rental rate equating the number of respondents who during the survey stated that they were willing to rent/rent out a car. We also performed a sensitivity analysis with reference to the uncertain parameters we specified in the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper applying an agent-based model to describe both sides of the P2PCS market. Moreover, most of the parameters we used to specify the simulation model are micro-founded and are based on a stated preference (SP) survey, increasing the consistency and reliability of our simulations.====In summary, this paper contributes to the literature as follows: a) it models the uptake of a P2PCS via a disaggregate Bass Diffusion agent-based model; b) it simultaneously studies the interaction between the demand and the supply side of the market and the social interaction taking place among agents belonging to each side of the market; c) it forecasts how the trend of using cars for mobility as a service, the servitization versus the ownership paradigm, will increase the diffusion of the P2PCS; d) it describes how transport policy packages could increase the P2PCS uptake.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on P2PCS modelling, Section 3 describes the stated preference survey, Section 4 illustrates the simulation model, Section 5 presents the simulation and sensitivity analysis, Section 6 summarizes the policy scenario analysis, while Section 7 discusses the main results and describes the future research lines.",Insights into peer-to-peer carsharing: Modelling and scenario analysis via a Bass diffusion agent-based model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592300001X,10 February 2023,2023,Research Article,15.0

The impact of the pandemic and related government restriction measures on international freight transportation is worth analysing for the development of transportation policies and practices in the post-pandemic period, but has received limited attention. To fill the gap, this study applies structural equation models to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the international transportation market and the relationships among the pandemic, government restriction measures, and international transportation market. The impact is also differentiated for different modes of transportation. Results confirm that both demand and supply of international transportation services have been negatively affected by the first wave of the pandemic, with sea transportation being more affected by the reduction of demand and air transportation more by the supply volatility. The government restriction measures are found to play a mediation role, in the way that the impact of the pandemic on the supply of transportation service is suppressed through the government restriction measures. Our findings provide important guidance for transportation industry players and governments in their decision-making process facing with global market shocks such as a pandemic.","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020, and government restriction measures to contain the pandemic have led to an inevitably huge blow to the world economy and widespread challenges (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Although a relative rebound was observed in the second half of 2020, it remained negative on the year-over-year basis (====).====The pandemic not only has an impact on the demand for transportation services which stems from international trade, but also on the supply of transportation. The maritime shipping sector, for example, experienced surges in the number of blank or skipped sailings and idle containership capacity in the first half of 2020 (====). Effective capacity management by liner shipping companies helped to prevent the initial collapse of freight rates (====). However, in the second half of 2020, there has been a spike in freight rates hitting record levels, as a combining result of capacity management, burgeoning transportation demands and shortages of containers (====). Air transportation is also one of the sectors which were hit hard by the pandemic (====).====). Meanwhile, in contrast to air and maritime shipping, rail transportation was nearly uninterrupted. (====).====Given the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the transportation and logistics sector, scholars have widely investigated the topic for a range of modes (e.g., air (====; ====), sea (====; ====), rail (====), and highway (====)). However, most relevant research studies focused on domestic markets, with few studies analyzing the international market.====Furthermore, as many studies have shown, government restriction measures to contain the pandemic could trigger a highly unexplored ripple effect (====; ====). The freight transportation sectors provide services to support international trade flows, while governments have adopted various levels of restriction measures to fight against the pandemic spread but also have caused more uncertainties and disturbances in the transportation markets. ==== argued that the strictness of government restriction measures is positively correlated with import trade but negatively correlated with export trade. However, the role that government intervention in overall international transportation and different transportation modes is not fully understood.====Therefore, this study's first aim is to understand the early impact of the pandemic and especially, government restriction measures, on the supply and demand of international transportation through an analysis of EU imports from China during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. As China was the largest exporter for EU (the world's second largest importer) and it is also the third largest importer in 2020 (====), the container exports from China to EU are highly representative of the international trade situation.====Furthermore, it is observed that the international trade and transportation market performed differently in different waves of the pandemic. Thus, the second motivation of this study is to analyze the different performances of the three main modes of international transportation, that is, sea, rail, and air under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures.====To achieve our research goals, eight hypotheses are brought forward and tested using Structural Equation Model (SEM), a ==== technique. With respect to the unevenly distributed transportation supply and demand in modes during the pandemic, a disaggregate analysis on the three main international transportation modes is then conducted from a more microscopic perspective, using the mode-based shipping volumes of EU imports from China.====To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study that simultaneously investigates the severity of the pandemic, the strictness of government restriction measures, and transportation infrastructure to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international freight transport. Particularly, the mediation effect of the government containment measures on the freight transportation market and the heterogeneous pandemic impacts on the three types of transportation modes for international trade flows are for the first time analyzed in the literature.

With reference to middle school students, instead, it is expected that children and parents jointly take the choice on how to commute and it is relevant to detect the role played by each family member in the decision-making process.====Our results will be useful to local administrators, policy-makers and decision-makers in order to design, implement and support transport and demand ==== that are effective in shifting the mobility habits of middle school students toward healthier and more sustainable means of transportation.","Active mobility (i.e., walking and cycling) is a crucial aspect of a healthy lifestyle especially for young people as active mobility in childhood and adolescence has a very long-lasting impact on adult health (Gunter et al., 2012). Active school travel improves cardiorespiratory fitness (Gaya et al., 2009; Leary et al., 2008; Sugiyama et al., 2007; Voss & Sandercock, 2010), reduces metabolic syndrome (Hansen et al., 2018), and maintains a healthy weight (Lee et al., 2008). It enhances perceived self-efficacy (Rutberg & Lindqvist, 2018), reduces feelings of loneliness through the mediation of a stronger sense of community (Pacilli et al., 2013), and improves mental health and wellbeing (Herrero et al., 2021; Ramanathan et al., 2014; Ruiz-Ariza et al., 2015; Stark et al., 2018 b; Yang et al., 2014). It also increases the overall levels of physical activity (Larouche et al., 2012), supports neighborhood social cohesion (du Toit et al., 2007), and encourages children's autonomy in the use and exploration of public spaces (Prezza et al., 2009).====A large proportion of intra-EU travel (20%) relates to the mobility of children and young people, mainly due to movement to and from schools (Casadó et al., 2020). Therefore, additional positive externalities of active commuting to school include the reduction of traffic, congestion, crashes, noise, energy consumption, and harmful gas emissions (Brand et al., 2021; Ferretto et al., 2021; Lozzi & Monachino, 2021; Qiu & He, 2018; Temjanovski et al., 2019). Moreover, it is beneficial for organizing family time (Prezza, 2007).====Despite the undoubted health and environmental benefits of active commuting to school, active child transport and independent mobility (i.e., the freedom to actively travel without adult supervision) have largely declined in recent decades. Many countries have recorded negative trends including Canada (Rothman et al., 2021), the Czech Republic (Pavelka et al., 2017), France (Fillon et al., 2021), Germany (Schmidt et al., 2017), New Zealand (Ikeda et al., 2018), Spain (Chillón et al., 2013), the UK (Macdonald et al., 2019; Nikitas et al., 2019), and the USA (Kontou et al., 2020).====In Italy, the percentage of middle-school students going to school in an active manner decreased from 49% in 2001 to 43% in 2020. In 2020, children aged 11–13 were by far the student segment most frequently walking or cycling to school, 39.6% and 3.5%, respectively. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (====) reports a sharp decline of active commuters as students get older, reaching the lowest number (17%) among students aged 18–19 (last year of high school). In fact, up to middle school, children usually attend a school close to home and can safely walk or cycle the short distance from home to school. Once they start attending high school, they begin to travel independently. Indeed, according to Italian law, parents must accompany their children to school until they are 14 years old. Moreover, the density of high schools is much lower than the density of primary and middle schools, implying greater travel distances and requiring faster motorized means of transport.====In the literature, there are several articles analyzing which factors prevent (or favor) children's active travel to school. However, only few studies analyzed the barriers towards active commuting to/from school as perceived by both parents and children (remarkable exceptions being Aranda-Balboa et al., 2021, and Wilson et al., 2018). In addition, no research attempted to detect whether parents' rather than children's concerns prevail in determining the transport mode used. In fact, although in the literature the usual approach is to assume that young people are passive agents adapting their behavior to their parents' decisions; Casadó et al. (2020) proved that children's mobility habits are also shaped by their own needs and perceptions. Only adopting this broader view, which considers both children's and adults' views and preferences, will policy makers and local administrators be able to design and implement policies and initiatives that are effective in promoting and supporting active commuting among young people and their families.====This research will advance the understanding of the factors driving the choice of active commuting to school by examining the following research questions:====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article focused on an Italian case study that analyzes the full range of factors that influence children's independent travel to school, including trip, child, and parents' characteristics, and that jointly considers the subjective concerns, attitudes, and perceptions of both parents and children. As a case study, we have selected the city of Trieste, a medium-sized city located in the northeastern part of Italy. In Trieste the percentage of residents commuting on foot (30%) is in line with the values recorded at the national level (31.5%), while the percentage of residents travelling by bicycle (1%) is significantly lower than the national value (7.1%) mostly due to the hilly nature of some parts of the city.====The article is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on active commuting to school. Section 3 describes the geographical context of the research and the methodology we used to collect the data. Section 4 reports the descriptive statistics, the modelling framework, and the econometric results. Section 5 discusses and compares the results obtained with the evidence presented in the literature and draws some policy implications.",Comparing children and parental preferences for active commuting to school.

Network changes are characterized in terms of airport pairs, city pairs, numbers of flights and network overlaps. The results show that European LCCs increasingly expanded their networks into markets that had already been served by incumbent LCCs, which indicates that LCCs increasingly compete head-to-head among themselves. Difference-in-differences regressions estimate that network overlaps among these LCCs lead to airfare reductions of approximately six Euros, ten percent.","Europe accounted for more than one quarter of all flights worldwide and almost one quarter of all international flights in 2019 (====). A large share of those flights and the corresponding passengers are served by Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) which typically operate point-to-point networks with a homogeneous fleet. This is in contrast to Full Service Carriers (FSCs) which operate hub-and-spoke networks with a wide variety of different aircraft. LCCs provided 534 million seats reflecting more than 37 percent of the total capacity offered by airlines registered in Europe in the year of 2019 (====). The three biggest LCCs in terms of seats offered in Europe are easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air (====).====This study considers the flight network changes of the three biggest European LCCs before and during the Covid-19 period. The objective is to describe changes in the competitive environment and to quantify how these changes affect airfares. Competition is considered as most intense on origin-destination routes which are operated in parallel by airlines. Therefore, the analysis especially concentrates on the change of network overlaps by distinguishing between origin-destination routes described by airport pairs or city pairs. The latter distinction allows identifying the role of adjacent airports in multi-airport regions.====Many flights were originally scheduled for operation during the Covid-19 pandemic but later canceled because of travel bans and demand reductions caused by compulsory quarantines among other regulations. To develop a valid dataset, this study uses flight information provided by Flightradar24. The virtue of this database is that it tracks actual flights in real time and, thus, does not include flights that are scheduled but not operated. This data source has been used by ==== and ==== amongst others.====This study complements previous studies which considered airline networks in Europe and elsewhere. ==== found that LCCs were drawing new networks complementing those of FSCs. In a subsequent study, ==== found that LCCs increasingly moved in frontal competition with FSCs on pre-existing airport pairs. ==== found that the route networks of LCCs in Europe were not stable and route churn occurred frequently. ==== highlighted that LCCs were increasing their operations from major airports. The importance of major airports for LCC networks has been further highlighted in a recent study by ====. Major airports are often prone to delays. ==== highlighted that the LCCs’ fast aircraft turn-around times improve the delay performances of airports.====Several studies have considered the airfare impact of overlapping flight networks. ==== found that LCC competition exerted dramatic downward pressure on airfares. He used an original set of competition variables to quantify the impact that Southwest Airlines had on airfares through actual, adjacent, and potential competition. ==== discussed three types of markets and levels of competition: in-market airport pairs, adjacent city pairs for both legacy carriers and LCCs, and potential competition from LCCs. Their results indicated that the airline competition via the use of adjacent airports could effectively reduce airfares. ==== and ==== considered network overlaps among LCCs in the US and New Zealand, respectively. They found that the LCCs’ entry decisions on domestic airport pairs had become less sensitive or were not sensitive, respectively, to airline competition within the same market. ==== considered airline competition in non-price product characteristics such as flight frequencies.====This study contributes to the above-mentioned studies by indicating that the three big European LCCs increasingly expanded their network and/or diverted flights into markets that had already been served by incumbent LCCs. These changes can be observed before and even during the Covid-19 pandemic period. This provides evidence for a trend that involves increasing overlaps among LCC networks in Europe. This study further contributes by quantifying the effect of network overlaps on airfares. Difference-in-differences estimations indicate that network overlaps reduce airfares by around six Euros or, approximately, ten percent of the airfares.====The paper is organized as follows.

However, transit services in most developing nations are characterized by longer journey time, high fare, unsafe and uncomfortable travel. Hence, this study seeks to analyze the travel experience of public transit users through the lens of vulnerability. The main objective of the research is to investigate transit users’ expenditure on travel, both in terms of time and money, which are regarded as “budgets” allocated to travel. The analysis is based on a survey distributed to 457 public transit users in Addis Ababa. The study applied proportions, percentages and cross-tabulation of key variables and statistical methods, such as one-way ANOVA to analyze the level of vulnerability of transit users. The result shows that low- and middle-income groups bear a higher level of travel burden, in terms of total ","Transport is the means of (and the lack of transport is the impediment to) accessibility to jobs, health care facilities, education, and social services that are essential to the welfare of the society. Inaccessibility emerges as a major cause of social exclusion of the poor in urban areas (World Bank, 2002).====Public transit, together with other modes of transport such as walking and cycling, is the main mode of transport relied on by low-income groups (Baindur & Rao, 2016). As a result, affordable public transit is critical for low-income population. As it is argued by Cao et al., 2018 & Delbosc & Currie, 2011, people should have equal access to mass transit and one way to achieve equity is to provide public transit to individuals who need it most. However, providing equitable and efficient public transit services is a challenging task in the developing countries due to high population density, low financial capability, spatially separated land uses and ever-increasing demand with the limited resource available (Agarwal et al., 2017).====Access to sustainable and affordable transport is critical for the urban dwellers, as it offers a way out from economic and social challenges. It is also a key link to access social services and livelihood assets. Affordable transport can also influence individual's assets, such as financial asset, in terms of travel cost. For most of low-income households, access to formal transit services is often out of their reach due to high fares. In other circumstances, unaffordable transport options that are available might lead to other stresses in terms of the journey time required and unsafe and uncomfortable travelling conditions (Lucas et al., 2016). Such transportation burden becomes a key issue affecting the quality of urban life. Transport costs have been increasing in many countries, with families spending a significantly larger percentage of their income on transport (Zhao & Li, 2016). The problem is highly pronounced on the low-income groups as they usually bear a high level of travel burden. In developing countries, travel times remain higher for the lower socio-economic groups.====Public transit service characteristics coupled with individual features such as socio-economic status exacerbate the transport vulnerability situation of urban residents. For instance, among others, women and low-income groups face travel difficulties disproportionately in terms of their income paid more for transportation, as well as having longer travel times to access services (Dodson et al., 2006).====Hence, this paper aims to assess the experience of public transit users by employing the concept of vulnerability. The research will be useful in bringing important concepts and perspectives in the analysis of the social dimension of transport. On top of that, the result will also be useful in identifying the needs and priorities of vulnerable public transit users in policy formulation.====The paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the literature on vulnerability and its application in transport studies.

As a response, the Mexican rail regulator, the Regulatory Agency of Rail Transport (ARTF) responsible for overseeing different aspects of rail transportation, such as the ==== regarding tariffs, established the regulation and determined maximum rates for the provision of the rail service concerning three different concessionaires in twenty origin-destination pairs for the transportation of chlorine, ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia, and caustic soda.==== or “second best”), plus the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.====The results of the rate regulation of the Mexican rail concessions showed a significant reduction of the rates actually charged in 66% on average and 77% with respect to the registered rates. Although the implementation is not complete, as the regulation is being analyzed in the tribunals, the economic regulation showed that the rates are very far from the average cost in the absent of effective competition. More research needs to be done to evaluate the real impact of the first economic regulation of the Mexican rail concessions.","In 1995, Mexican railways experienced a radical change from a large vertically integrated and government-owned railway to a system of regional concessions when the monolithic railway was restructured and concessioned during the period 1997–1999. As a result, three major regional exclusive, vertically integrated private freight railway concessions,==== a terminal company in Mexico City (jointly owned by the three private companies and the Government) and several short lines were the new players of the rail industry. In the case of Mexico, it was decided to concession the infrastructure and operation of rail services to private companies, instead of privatizing the infrastructure as in the United States and Canada, where the operators own the infrastructure.====Although each of the three companies is a monopoly in its own region, Mexican railways are characterized by “source” or “geographic” competition (Pittman 2002). In other words, there are a number of alternative geographical sources of supply or alternative destinations available to the shipper or receiver. For instance, much of the rail traffic in Mexico is international traffic and the combination of different ports and U.S. connecting railroads can be used to provide economic alternatives (Pittman 2002). In 2021, 70.5% of the total rail freight was international traffic as shown in Table 1.====However, geographical competition mainly applies for international traffic but not for local traffic as the exclusivity of the regional concessions restrict rail competition, that is the intramodal competition. After the merger between Ferromex and Ferrosur in 2011, today, there are only two main players in the Mexican freight rail industry that remain vertically integrated private freight railway concessions, Grupo Mexico (GMexico) and Kansas City Southern de Mexico (KCSM), where the network of these two groups can be seen in Fig. 1. Both companies concentrate more than 99% of the rail traffic in Mexico as shown in Table 2. The interaction between the two main players is very low, as only about 6% of their rail network is share using trackage rights and the interlineal traffic, where freight is handled by two operators, is around 10% of the total tons moved by rail OECD (2020). In terms of the rates, some studies have found that, in the case of interlineal routes, the rate per kilometre for completing 5% of a route is between 7.4 and 10.7 times greater that the tariff per kilometre of the concessionaire that serves the 95% of the route (COFECE 2020).====On February 2020, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) issued a resolution on lack of competition in 20 Origin-Destination pairs (routes) of the public freight railway transportation of four chemical products (chlorine, ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia and caustic soda) originating mainly in the southern region of the state of Veracruz close to the port of Coatzacoalcos. These routes are operated by either the concessionaires KCSM or by GMexico or by a combination of these two.====According to the COFECE's investigation on the routes of rail transport of chemical products originating in southern Veracruz, the existence of alternative railways or other modes of transport (road, maritime, air or pipelines) available to users for the transportation of chlorine, ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia, and caustic soda could not be found and the users of the rail services are subjected to conditions imposed by the two companies KCSM and GMexico along with a lack of sufficient bargaining power to negotiate rates, which may result in raised service rates as the railroad concessionaires were dominant in the provision of the rail transport of these chemical products (COFECE-004-2020).====Some of the main findings from the COFECE's investigation was that the rail freight transport service had not substitutes in the investigated routes for transportation of chlorine, ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia, and caustic soda, as well as, it was the safest option regarding the population and the environment, as these products are dangerous substances which require specialized equipment, procedures and care in their handling and safe transport. Thus, it was concluded that the rail transport service was the only technically and economically feasible alternative to transport these hazardous products. In the case of road transport, it was not technically and economically feasible due to capacity and rate difference as well as regulations for the safe and secure transportation of these products on these routes. Sea transport was also not a feasible substitute since the destination points are located in places geographically distant from a sea port. Similarly, air transport was not a feasible substitute since there are prohibitions on the transport of these products by air transport. Moreover, COFECE identified barriers to enter the market, absence of trackage rights and reciprocal switching. In addition, there were not alternative geographical sources of supply or alternative destinations available to the shipper, in other words, there were not geographic competition in these routes and products. Thus, the rail companies have sufficient market power to fix the rates of the public rail transport services of these hazardous products on the probed routes, as well as, restrict the supply or access to their rail networks. As a result, COFECE resolved that effective competition conditions were inexistent in 20 railway routes for transportation of these four chemicals products.====Thus, in this case, the users of these transport services were considered as captive shippers, as they have no other economically viable alternative to transport their shipment rather than the railroad company that provides the transportation service and therefore the shippers have a small elastic of demand, therefore the railroad company has the incentive to charge an extremely high markup over the marginal cost of the shipment (Wilson & Wolak, November 2018). Thus, given that the rail companies have sufficient market power on the transport services of the hazardous products on the probed routes, the demand is relatively inelastic, that is the price elasticity of demand, ====, is small (|====| < 1). Therefore, a rate rise will cause of rise in revenue due to the marginal revenue is equal to Rate(1+(1/====) and the effect is to sell fewer services at a higher rate (Glaister S. 1981).====With the resolution on lack of effective competition by COFECE, it was open the possibility to protect the captive shippers by the regulation of transport rates for these products in these routes by the rail regulator in Mexico the Regulatory Agency of Rail Transport (ARTF), according to the Article 47 of the Law on the Regulation of Rail Services. As a response to the lack of effective competition determined by COFECE, the Mexican rail regulator, the Regulatory Agency of Rail Transport (ARTF) responsible for overseeing different aspects of rail transportation, such as the economic regulation regarding tariffs, established the regulation and determined maximum rates for the provision of the rail service concerning three different concessionaires in twenty origin-destination pairs for the transportation of chlorine, ethylene oxide, anhydrous ammonia, and caustic soda. This was the first resolution on lack of effective competition conditions issued by COFECE since its creation in 2013 and also the first time that the ARTF issued a rate regulation since its creation in 2016.",Establishing the first economic regulation of the Mexican rail concessions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000750,Available online 5 December 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

However, only few studies employed predictive models to assess the effectiveness of ==== interventions and understand the impact of both objective and socio-psychological variables on changes in travel behavior. Additionally, though a combination of ==== and ==== measures is recognized as achieving the best results in reducing car use, few studies differentiate between the effects of the two types. The aim of this work is to quantify the effect of a combination of ==== (introduction of a new light railway line) and ==== from the ==== measure. We specified and estimated an Integrated Choice and Laten Variable (ICLV) model to assess the effect of both objective characteristics and some socio-psychological variables on the choice to use a new light railway service or not. Model results point out that people who lived along the light rail corridor and received and read their Personalized Travel Plan were more likely to switch from car to the light rail. Furthermore, we found that the parameters associated with the psycho-social variables ==== and ==== have a negative influence on the probability to use the new travel alternative. At the same time, our findings on the effect of the soft measure need to be interpreted with some caution as its impact on choice probability was mitigated by travel distance and psycho-social variables.","In recent years Travel Demand Management measures have attracted the attention of policy-makers, transport operators and academic researchers, given the not-inconsiderable social, environmental and economic impacts generated by road transportation. These strategies can be divided into structural and information measures. Structural measures, also referred to as ==== measures, aim to change the physical and/or legislative context in which choices are made. Examples of ==== measures are road pricing, road closures and improvements to infrastructure (==== the introduction of a new bus route). Behavioral measures, also named ==== measures or Voluntary Travel Behavior Change (VTBC) programs, are interventions designed to provide appropriate information and assistance to encourage people to use more sustainable means of transport (Sanjust di Teulada et al.==== 2014).====Different VTBC programs have been implemented worldwide over the past 20 years, adopting a variety of methodological approaches. Some examples include TravelSmart (Brög et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2017; Mulley & Ma, 2018), Travel Blending (Rose & Ampt, 2001; Taylor & Ampt, 2003), Travel Feedback Programs (Fujii & Taniguchi, 2006) and Personalized Travel Plans (Cairns et al., 2008; Friman et al., 2013; Sanjust di Teulada et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2017; Sottile et al., 2021). In general, all these experiences indicate that soft interventions can reduce individuals’ car use by 4–15% (Cairns et al., 2008; Semenescu et al., 2020). Furthermore, soft measures are less costly to implement, compared to the construction of new infrastructures, and are more likely to be accepted by citizens than coercive measures such as parking management or road pricing (Eriksson et al., 2008).====Notwithstanding their undeniable advantages, public administrations and policy-makers still do not have the courage to implement these kinds of measures on a large scale as often being perceived to be ineffective in reducing the externalities generated by the use of the car (Gärling & Schuitema, 2007). Public administrations’ concerns are supported by the work of a number of researchers, which in some cases have raised doubts about the validity of earlier studies because of evaluation procedures used to measure the effectiveness of ==== interventions (Fujii et al., 2009; Stopher et al., 2009; Richter et al., 2011; Arroyo et al., 2018; Kristal & Whillans, 2020), as different factors can potentially distort the results (Semenescu et al., 2020; Stopher & Greaves, 2007).====One problem is the absence of a control or comparison group to control for external structural changes that can influence travel, independently of the intervention (Stopher et al., 2009). In fact, VTBC programs are often conducted within broader campaigns launched to reduce car travel, with a focus on the overall outcome (Tørnblad et al.==== 2014). The absence of a control group does not thus permit to determine the success or failure of implementing a single measure and to disentangle its effect from a combination of effects. For example, Fujii et al. (2009), who analyzed the results of 15 Japanese travel feedback programs, found that estimated effects of the measure differ depending on whether a control group was included in the study or not.====Another limitation concerns the understanding of which individual factors are able to drive behavior change (Sanjust di Teulada et al., 2014). In fact, the majority of studies on behavioral measures evaluate the results only in terms of descriptive statistics, like the change in commute mode, in the number of trips and in the distance traveled with different means of transport (Cairns et al., 2008; Brög et al., 2009; Sanjust di Teulada et al., 2015; Ahmed et al., 2020; Kristal & Whillans, 2020). Predictive models on the other hand are preferable, as they permit to control for the effects of several variables (Arroyo et al., 2018). Extensive research has shown that understanding which determinants influence mode choice is a precondition for transportation policy formulation and effectiveness assessment. In particular, beside trip characteristics and socio-demographic indicators, in recent years, different studies have recognized the importance of including socio-psychological characteristics, such as habits, emotions, values, attitudes and perceptions, in the description of the cognitive process underlying the choice of an environmentally-friendly transport alternative (Anable, 2005; De Witte et al., 2013; Steg, 2005). Although some studies have employed mathematical models to study the effects of ==== measures in different contexts (Arroyo et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2017; Mulley & Ma, 2018; Sanjust di Teulada et al., 2014), most of these do not include any socio-psychological indicators. Only a few works (Bamberg et al., 2003; Hsieh et al., 2017; Jariyasunant et al., 2015; Sottile et al., 2015) have investigated, from a modeling perspective, the role of socio-psychological indicators in the switch from car to more sustainable means of transport in the context of a VTBC program. However, some of these studies did not consider trip characteristics and socio-demographic indicators in their analysis nor did they include adequate control groups.====The third aspect that warrants further investigation concerns the joint effectiveness of introducing both structural and information measures (Ding et al., 2018; Gärling & Schuitema, 2007). In fact, the findings reported by researchers from around the world are often contradictory, making it difficult to understand whether the impact of ==== transport policies could be strengthened by implementing ==== measures.====Motivated by the discussion above, in this work we focus on the evaluation of the joint effectiveness of hard and soft strategies. To this end, we analyze panel data collected within a VTBC program conducted among a group of car drivers in the metropolitan area of Cagliari (Sardinia-Italy), where a new light railway line came into service in 2015.====The first specific objective of this study is to measure, with the help of descriptive statistical analysis and from a modeling standpoint, the impact on travel mode choice of combining structural (introduction of a new light railway line in the choice set) with behavioral (the provision of a Personalized Travel Plan) measures.====The second purpose of the paper is to investigate the influence of socio-psychological factors, as well as the effect of built-environment and demographic characteristics, in the cognitive process that can lead an individual to change their travel behavior. Indeed, the implementation of an information policy might not have the same effect on all participants but can vary depending on their socio-psychological characteristics, such us the affective value attributed to the car or environmental awareness. In doing so, we constructed an Integrated Choice and Latent Variables (ICLV) model (Vij & Walker, 2016), which permits to specify the utility to switch from car to light rail as a function of both objective and subjective variables.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review the existing work in the research areas covered in the present paper. Section 3 presents in detail the VTBC program conducted. Section 4 describes the data and sample characteristics and illustrates the results of behavior change from an aggregate standpoint. Section 5 describes the modeling approach, while modeling estimation results are discussed in section 6.

A complex network of connections among the islands and to the Greek peninsula serves the needs of tourism, transportation of goods and services, and islanders traveling to and from the mainland.====However, this system has shortcomings; in particular, interconnections for many islands are only possible via the mainland ports of Greece. Interconnectivity among the islands is important for the economic, social, and territorial cohesion of the archipelago as well as to meet the needs of tourism. This study looks into passengers’ acceptance of two alternative minor island connection ports that would increase remote island connectivity. ","The Aegean Archipelago in the East Mediterranean region consists of 65 inhabited islands with 77 ports. During the reference year 2015, a total of 15 operators provided regular passenger services on ferry and highspeed catamaran vessels in the area. A dense ferry network with 48 sealine routes, excluding the strait connections, has been developed empirically over the years to service a strongly peaking tourist season, when 164,000 long-distance passenger trips are taken by sea per day. Τhe system routes, fares, and schedules are determined through market-driven decisions of private sea operators that require prior approval from the state each year. According to Pantazis et al. (2013), some incentives and subsidies are given by the state for ferry services operating the so-called “thin lines” to remote Greek islands during the off-peak winter season. Sea voyages in the study area typically last between three and 13 h. The weighted mean in-vessel time is 4.5 h per passenger, and the mean voyage distance is 100 nautical miles.====The network has very good connections with the mainland ports of Attica and Northern Greece, but there are shortcomings in interconnections among islands which are serviced by different routes. In this study, two new insular interchange points to improve interconnectivity within the Archipelago are proposed. The choice of transfer hub to wait at is expected to be an important factor in the total travel experience, especially for holiday trips. As Mokhtarian (2005) argues, a trip can be an end in itself; thus, time spent traveling and waiting for transfer is not necessarily wasted. Furthermore, Tanko et al. (2019) suggest that transfer hubs can offer excess utility to ferry users as they value amenities and scenery as much as saving on travel time.====Airport hubs have received significantly more attention than ports as potential interchange hubs in research. Applying econometric models, Bhadra (2004) proves that minor aviation hubs have a positive effect on travel, and a study of passenger airport preferences by Leon (2011) similarly found that trip purpose, total travel time, number of connections, and chosen operator are significant determinants, along with fares.====The objectives of the current research are to:====This paper is composed of five sections.

Therefore, it bridges the fields of offshoring strategies and sustainability to supply new insights to firms and policy makers on the impact of sustainability on offshoring decisions. Our findings reveal that firms' sustainable initiatives demotivate offshoring in most cases, independent of their related motivations to delocalize. ","In a world characterized by global business opportunities and complex supply chain networks, firms establish offshoring production facilities in developing countries to create efficiency and achieve superior goals (Jahns, Hartmann, & Bals, 2006). The term “offshoring” refers to a firm's decision to move its production to a subsidiary plant in another country to exploit cost opportunities (Fontana & Prencipe, 2013). Doh (2005) define offshoring as the cross-border (re)location of the firm's value chain activities, which were previously carried out in the firm's country of origin and located to meet global rather than local demand. In the past, the offshoring decisions were most likely based on the firms' and governments' actions for managing goods and services, already obtained domestically at a global level and including foreign countries (Sako, 2005). Today, offshoring decisions have much broader implications involving suppliers, stakeholders, international associations and legislations, and governments.====Schmeisser (2013) summarizes the traditional antecedences that push firms to adopt an offshoring strategy, like the industry, technology, costs, availability of resources, institutions, information intensity, and knowledge. However, along with these traditional drivers sponsoring offshoring, sustainable strategies and targets emerge as new drivers to be considered by the corporate strategy. In fact, the motivations to offshore can highly depend on firms' sustainable attitudes, opportunities, constraints, and targets, which are linked to both the domestic and foreign governments' initiatives and interventions aiming at sustainability (Droste et al., 2016). Given that sustainability involves the society at large, the firms should consider its various aspects and dimensions when evaluating to offshore the production facilities (Venkatraman, 2004). Although there is a strong link between the fields of offshoring and sustainability, a research gap exists on the analysis of offshoring decisions driven by sustainability. Therefore, this study seeks to fulfill this gap by answering the following research question: “====It is well documented that governments set regulations, standards, and legislation to create public tools and instruments to drive firms' and stakeholders' actions through green behavior (Jabbour et al., 2015). The stylized framework for green economies developed by Röpke (1977) emphasizes the importance of governments defining rules within eco-systems, which include individuals' actions and interventions, firms' capacities to develop green initiatives, and their market structure, efficiency, and power. The transaction that firms undertake toward green economy certainly depends on the governments' interventions; therefore, offshoring production facilities need careful evaluations of the governments' sustainable policy and instruments, which can sanction and/or incentivize firms' behavior and decisions (Droste et al., 2016). Accordingly, this study seeks to investigate how governments' sustainable initiatives can impact on the firms' motivations of offshoring. Examples of government's sustainable initiatives are: setup of environmental requirements, sponsoring voluntary green programs, encourage the adoption of green technology, introduction of sustainable auditing and compliance, and support the environmental certifications. Therefore, the study suggests to firms the cases in which the domestic governments' sustainable initiatives either favor or deter offshoring.====Along with governments' interventions, offshoring decisions can also be driven by firms' sustainable initiatives. The latter allow firms to proactively implement their own sustainable policy independent of institutional constraints and the governments' involvement in the business affairs (Child & Tsai, 2005). Firms' environmental strategies can then be linked to other factors like competition (Fontana & Prencipe, 2013; Lo, 2014), innovation opportunities (De Giovanni, 2021), consumers' expectations and brand reputation (Hsu et al., 2016), or new market potential (Suganthi, 2019). An offshoring decision can significantly modify the dynamics behind these business aspects. Similarly, the firms can opt for offshoring according to their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) targets. This driver can be highly challenging for firms, as it includes social, environmental, and economic performance and consequently entails important trade-offs (De Giovanni & Esposito Vinzi, 2014). On the one hand, offshoring can undoubtedly lead to better operational efficiency achieved through low labor cost or low energy cost (Brandl et al., 2017). However, on the other hand, it would imply a natural decrease in the number of jobs available for people living in the domestic country (Venkatraman, 2004). Within this framework, our study seeks to analyze whether offshoring decisions depend on two firms' sustainable dimensions given by: the firms' sustainable initiatives and CSR performance. The former consists of the sustainable initiatives undertaken by firms like: adoption of green practices, investments in clean technologies, implementation of recycling options, usage of both green packaging and eco-friendly transport modes. Instead, the latter consists of a set of performance indicators measuring the firms’ CSR, which is composed of economic, environmental, and social performance measures. Hence, this study informs firms on whether their sustainable initiatives and CSR performance either favor or deter offshoring.====Finally, suppliers' sustainable initiatives can be important drivers to convince firms to embrace offshoring opportunities (Lo, 2014). In general, green suppliers undertake various types of environmental-based initiatives and require firms working within the supply chain to align with those green standards (Tachizawa et al., 2015). In fact, none of these green initiatives would be really effective if supply chain members do not align to the same green standards, targets, certifications, and procedures (De Giovanni & Cariola, 2021). When those features become very stringent, firms can find in offshoring the right solution to reinforce their environmental attitudes and images. As highlighted by Pisani and Ricart (2018), most developing countries have poor environmental regulation frameworks due to the lack of infrastructures, systems, funds, personnel, and political will. Through offshoring, firms can easily undertake voluntary initiatives, programs, and agreements to align with suppliers' sustainable strategies. Considering the influence of suppliers, this study seeks to investigate whether the suppliers' sustainable initiatives influence the offshoring decisions. Specifically, examples of suppliers’ sustainable initiatives are: the development of joint green initiatives, the implementation of green programs and actions, the usage of green targets and sustainable criteria for the supplier selection process, and the contribution to reduce the overall impact of the supply chain. Therefore, this study sheds light to firms on whether the suppliers' sustainable initiatives either favor or deter offshoring.====While the literature investigates the traditional drivers pushing firms to offshore their production facilities, this research focuses the earlier-mentioned sustainable based drivers, which consist of the sustainable initiatives undertaken by governments, firms, and suppliers as well as the firms' CSR performance. Accordingly, the research goals consist of verifying whether the firms' motivations for offshoring are driven by the sustainable initiatives established by governments, firms, and suppliers and/or by the firms' CSR performance. According to the literature of offshoring, we identify and focus on ten specific motivations to offshore, specifically: the stringent environmental legislation in the domestic country (e.g., Dominguez et al., 2020), the severe taxation system in the domestic country (e.g., Dominguez et al., 2020), the import/export taxation in the domestic country (e.g., Ellram et al., 2013), the technology progress in the host country (e.g., Pisani & Ricart, 2018), the government's sustainable development programs in the host country (e.g., Lartey et al., 2021), the labor costs in the host country (e.g., Farrell, 2004), the scale opportunities in the host country (e.g., Naghavi & Ottaviano, 2009), the logistics costs in the host country (e.g., Ellram et al., 2013), the cost for energy in the host country (e.g., Sturgeon, 2021), and the suppliers' location with respect to the host country (e.g., Sturgeon, 2021).====To pursue our research goals, we develop an empirical study and test a set of logistic regression models using a sample of 172 European firms. In each regression model, the dependent variable reflects the firms' motivations for offshoring. Instead, the independent variables consist of composite indicators summarizing the sustainable initiatives undertaken by firms, governments, and suppliers, along with the firms’ CSR performance. Therefore, each regression analysis informs firms on which sustainable dimension drives their motivations for offshoring.====Our findings suggest that the firms' sustainable initiatives play an important role in demotivating firms to offshore, independent of the related motivations to delocalize. The presence of appealing sustainable programs offered in the host country is the only true exception. The CSR performance discourages firms from offshoring associated with labor costs, scale effects to reduce the production costs, cost for energy, and sustainable programs in the host country. In all of these cases, CSR targets are more important than the benefits obtained through offshoring. The domestic country's sustainable initiatives push firms to renounce possible low labor costs, low energy costs, possible efficiency due to the suppliers' proximity, and the technological progress. Finally, the suppliers' sustainable initiatives encourage firms to offshore in two cases: in rigid taxation systems and amid high production costs in the domestic country. These two elements influence negatively the entire supply chain, which supports more efficient opportunities through offshoring.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Players are drivers competing in both cooperative and non-cooperative games. Utility is proportional to the total fare collection. Competition for picking up passengers leads to well documented and dangerous driving practices that cause road accidents, traffic congestion and pollution. We obtain theoretical results that support the existence and implementation of such practices, and give a qualitative description of how they come to occur. In addition, our results allow to compare the current competitive system with a more cooperative one.","In this work, we model the competition of bus drivers for passengers. The models – which are directed variants of the Salop model (Salop, 1979), in turn a circuit adaptation of the classic Hotelling model (Hotelling, 1929) – aim to characterize the dynamics of an informal transportation system with multiple negative externalities for passengers, drivers and other road users. Specifically, we focus on microbuses, but as it will be argued, other types of transport schemes may exhibit similar goals and strategies.====Microbuses are privately owned minibuses and passenger vans with a 15 to 45 people seating capacity operating under concession agreements. Individual microbus owners organize into collectives owning route permits and they rent their units to individual drivers. Drivers directly collect distance-based fares (in cash) from users, reserving a fixed daily quota for the owners and keeping the rest for themselves.====The use of this form of transport is extensive, particularly in developing countries. It is estimated that paratransit public transport like microbuses and taxibuses accounts for more than half of the collective public transport share in Latin America and Africa (Tun, Welle, Hidalgo, Albuquerque, Castellanos, Sclar, & Escalante, 2020) and Eno Akpa, Booysen, and Sinclair (2019). In 2017, Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) conducted its mobility survey and estimated that nearly 3 out of 4 trips made by public transport in Mexico City and its conurbation are done by microbuses (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2017). The estimated number of microbuses in the city is 14,000, and there are approximately 45,000 legally registered microbus drivers (López, 2017) and Berrones-Sanz (2014). Despite its apparent popularity, the service exhibits a number of problems like congestion, pollution, and quality and safety issues. In the 2019 survey on victimization in public transport in Greater Mexico City (Consultant Buendía y Laredo, 2019), around 65% of the interviewees deemed the quality of concession transport to be bad or very bad, and 87% considered that traveling by it was dangerous. Part of the persistence of these problems and perceptions is due to the government’s inability to hold operators accountable for breaching the terms of the concession, which include keeping vehicles in proper, hygienic and safe conditions, having insurance, providing training to drivers, among others (Reglamento Para El Servicio de Transporte de Pasajeros En El Distrito Federal, 1997). This is why some authors refer to these type of transport systems as informal, attributing the informality to the lack of regulation from the state (Paget-Seekins & Tironi, 2016).====Faced with similar problems, some cities opted for enhancing the regulation of public transport to improve service quality. Santiago, Cali and Bogotá transitioned from semi-deregulated schemes like the one described above, to integrated transport systems with Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): ====, ==== and ==== respectively. Infrastructure for BRT networks like bus stations and terminals were publicly funded, while articulated vehicles were provided by private operators under concession contracts (Hidalgo & King, 2014). Bus operators were paid a fixed amount per kilometer, and fares were electronically collected by third parties via smart cards. In 2005, Mexico City introduced its first BRT ==== corridor and in 2008, it expanded it 8.5 km further and inaugurated a second one. It is worth pointing out that these regulations were not without fault. Transmilenio and Metrobus soon ran into financial difficulties, while Transantiago operated with an insufficient number of buses which shared the road with private cars and other vehicles, causing increased waiting times and bus bunching (Muñoz & Gschwender, 2009).====The benefits of transport intervention brought about safer and more reliable trips. In particular, Transantiago halved the number of accidents involving buses and it reduced bus-related noise and pollution levels, and robberies and social discrimination (Muñoz, Batarce, & Hidalgo, 2014). However, there are a couple of reasons why these regulated systems have not completely taken over informal transport. Indeed, formal and informal services coexist in many Latin American cities, like Mexico City, who retains a state-owned subway, a publicly owned bus company and microbuses. Firstly, the expansion of BRT networks has not been more expedite due to the complexity of negotiations with paratransit organizations and the amount of governmental subsidies required to satisfy deals with previous and incumbent operators (Flores & Zegras, 2012). In addition, there are desirable characteristics of informal transportation, like its affordability, their gap-filler quality of filling service voids by formal public transport and its adaptability to user’s needs (Cervero, 2000) and Tun et al. (2020). Insofar as microbuses are expected to remain a complement to formal public transportation, local authorities have pushed for increasing safety conditions through the renewal of fleets and bus maintenance. Mexico City’s Ministry of Mobility announced a 45 million dollar plan to scrap and replace 6,000 buses and microbuses between 2021 and 2023. The new buses are Enhanced Environmentally Friendly Vehicles (EEV) equipped with mobile surveillance cameras and GPS tracking devices. Given the government’s limited ability to regulate informal transport, it is unclear how GPS records can be used to monitor or even deter operational conflicts. As of yet, there has been no mention of the mechanisms for collecting and managing information, nevertheless we highlight that the case of Transantiago sheds light on the use of GPS and smart card data to develop quality of service indicators as well as methods to evaluate the modification of bus lines and specialized infrastructure. See Gschwender, Munizaga, and Simonetti (2016) for a fuller discussion of the various tools and methodologies developed by academics in collaboration with the public transport authority of Santiago. We also point the reader to Cortés, Gibson, Gschwender, Munizaga, and Zuniga (2011), Godachevich and Tirachini (2021) and Beltrán and Palma (2013) for a treatment of Transantiago’s GPS and smart card databases to develop speed and performance indicators – such as the average speed of buses over stretches, headway variability and seat/standing places per hour – and their implications on service reliability and operator compliance with the Operational Programs. Notwithstanding that buses are part of the safety issue, another risk inducing factor are the practices of drivers.====In this work, we study how the competition of microbus drivers to collect passenger leads to dangerous or inefficient driving practices. We argue that they are induced by competition, which results from a few salient characteristics of microbuses: the salaries of drivers are not fixed, but instead depend on the number of picked up passengers, there are no designated bus stops (meaning that the drivers may collect or drop off passengers at any given point along the route), and there are no timetables or schedule constraints. Altogether, we have a system where drivers aim to maximize revenue, either by maximizing the number of passengers, cutting driving costs, or a combination of both. Through a simplified model of competition, we characterize how the following practices enlisted in Foster and Golay (1986) come to occur.====It is worth pointing out that some inefficient practices are observed even in private bus systems with timetables. In particular, after the Transport Act 1985 (Transport Act, 1985), bus operators in the United Kingdom (excepting the Greater London Area) were free to register a local service by submitting the details of the route, timetable and maximum size of the vehicle to the Traffic Commissioners 42 days in advance. Despite the fact that anti-competitive practices like companies agreeing on operating a joint timetable were discouraged through laws and supervised by The Monopolies and Mergers Commission (Simpson, 1996), outcomes like bus bunching could still be observed because the operators (the organizations owning the buses) could amend their timetable registrations to shorten or lengthen bus interarrival times in order to maximize the number of picked up passengers.==== Note that in this case, the drivers themselves received a fixed wage, and thus had no incentive to change their arrival times, nevertheless their actions were driven by profit maximizing operators, and resulted in increased waiting times for users.====We model the situation where bus drivers compete to maximize their utility, which is proportional to the number of passengers boarding the units. As a proxy for the number of passengers collected, we use the road ahead up to the next bus. The strategies available to drivers are the driving speeds. Time, like strategies themselves, is continuous. For simplicity, we do not allow drivers to change speed any time they want, instead we assume that they maintain a chosen speed for a given time, and let them change it in the next. While practical, the assumption also reflects the empirical observation that bus drivers make strategic stops along the road, where they obtain information on the game. More precisely, they pay agents that collect the arrival times and identity of previous bus drivers (these information intermediaries are called ‘sapos’ in Chile); this way, the drivers realize whether they are competing against known peers, and more importantly, whether they should adjust their speed on the next leg of the route. We derive a simple interpretation of the results that is consistent with some of the driving practices mentioned above, namely (1), (3) and (4). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is novel, and it allows us to model a variety of scenarios and obtain explicit descriptions of equilibria. Furthermore, we are able to explore the time evolution of the adopted strategies. All the results are expressed in terms of the behavior of the drivers. Given the tractability of our models, some natural questions emerge, nevertheless, we restrict our attention to the theoretical aspects of the problem. On that account, ours could well be a complement of Johnson, Reiley, and Muñoz (2015) empirical work on competition for passengers in Santiago. Specifically, we tackle the problem they set aside, which is “...to abstract away from the significant complexities of involved in creating a dynamic model of endogenous (that is, drivers reacting to each other) and exogenous perturbations in bus spacing”. Correspondingly, we refer the reader to their article for a treatment of bus-arrival data in incentive-contract (per-passenger compensation) routes, and its implications on consumer welfare as a function of the expected waiting time for a random passenger arriving at a bus stop.====Relevant literature on transport problems includes (Newell, 1971) modeling of the optimal headway bus service from the point of view of a central dispatcher. In the historical context of Transport Act 1985 (Transport Act, 1985), several scientific articles analyzed the effect of the privatization. Under the assumption of the existence of an economic equilibrium in the competition system, Foster and Golay (1986) classify the driving practices into two categories: those consistent with the equilibrium, and those who are not. They analyzed the expected timetables in the deregulated scenario. In Evans (1987) a comparative analysis of fare and timetable allocation in competition, monopoly and net benefit maximization (both restricted and unrestricted to a zero profit) models is presented. Building on from this, Ireland (1991) introduces the consumer’s perspective and obtains the equilibria prices and number of services offered by transport companies. The possibility of predatory behavior between two enterprises competing through fares and service level, is analyzed by Dodgson, Katsoulacos, and Newton (1993), using the data from the city of Inverness. In Ellis and Silva (1998) the authors study the optimal policies of competing enterprises in terms of fares, and the bus service headway, in a unique bus stop and destination scenario. They also introduce the concept of ==== which can be implemented through timetables. Assuming a spatial directed model with a single enterprise, de Palma and Lindsey (2001) find the timetable that minimizes the costs associated to service delays. The work of Borenstein and Netz (1999) analyzes flight time data and finds empirical evidence to support Hotelling models. From a non-economic perspective, Baik, Borodin, Deift, and Suidan (2006) models competing buses in a circuit behaving like random particles with repulsion between them (meaning they could not pass each other). A contemporary review on transport market models using game theory is given by Adler, Brudner, and Proost (2020), and a general review of control problems which arise in buses transport systems is presented in Ibarra-Rojas, Delgado, Giesen, and Munoz (2015).====This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the general model, and the single and two player games. Relevant definitions, notation and interpretations are introduced. In Section 3 we present the solutions to the games and include in Section 3.3 the evolution of the strategies adopted by the drivers. That is, we look at the long-run equilibria of the games.

China's air transport market was the first to be hit hard by COVID-19 (====). Since China became the second-largest civil aviation market in 2005 worldwide, its air transport industry has developed rapidly, and many Chinese airports have become international hubs (====; ====). However, the progress of China's air transport industry has not been smooth. The rapid development of high-speed railways has caused more frequent air–rail competition (====; ====), which has led, in turn, to a decline in civil aviation passenger traffic (====, ====). In 2020, the pandemic caused Chinese airlines to turn from profitable operations to operating in the red.

France has set the ambitious goal to reduce CO2 emissions and the dependency on petroleum products by 40% by 2030, with respect to the emissions level in 1990, and ban high-emission vehicles by 2030 (French National Assembly, 2021). Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) have noteworthy potential to reduce petroleum dependency and GHGs emissions related to the road transportation sector towards global decarbonization (Hainsch et al., 2021). PEVs encompass Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), which use the electricity stored in the battery as a primary energy source, and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), which use both fossil fuel and battery as sources of energy. If the electricity is produced using renewable energy sources, the GHG emissions from transportation are significantly lower than fossil-fuel based transport. While this technology's adoption has been rapidly increasing over the last decade, its market share remains restrained by socio-techno-economic barriers (Egbue & Long, 2012). The reasons for the slow uptake of PEVs compared to ICEVs are generally divided into technical (long charging duration, limited BEV range), economic (PEV purchase, electricity, and fuel prices), awareness (client behaviour towards new inventions, charging stations visibility, number of PEV models), and socio-demographic factors (age, education, income, environmentalism, and urbanity degree) (Egbue & Long, 2012; Javid & Nejat, 2017; Sierzchula et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2012). To overcome these obstacles, governments applied national and local, monetary, and non-monetary policies for all the PEV supply chain members (Sykes & Axsen, 2017).====PEVs presented around 4% of France's total vehicle sales until 2020 (French Ministry of Ecological Transition, 2020a). France adopted several laws to reduce fossil-fuel dependency, such as the Provisions of the Energy Transition Law for Green Growth and the Mobility Orientation Law (French Ministry of Ecological Transition, 2021). Increasing fossil-fuel prices, a statute in these laws, proved to be a solution that pushes drivers to switch from ICEVs to PEVs in several countries (Li, Tong, et al., 2017; Plötz et al., 2016). However, it led to the Yellow Vests social movement, pushing the French government to search for other solutions to accelerate the electric mobility transition. Meanwhile, local authorities, such as municipalities at Ile-de-France, Marseille, and Nice, contributed to making EVs more attractive to consumers by offering financial subsidies of a maximum of 5000€ to each driver switching to electric mobility to tax exemption, free parking, and access to bus lanes. Since the lack of charging infrastructure still presents a barrier to growth in the PEV market, as the driver suffers from range anxiety –the fear of a blackout in the middle of the road– national and local authorities in France boosted the deployment of this infrastructure by both installing more public chargers (e.g. Corri-door project (EC, 2013)) and offering up to 50% of the cost of the charger for both private and public usage (e.g. ADVENIR project (Advenir project, 2020)). In sum, the French government allocated 100 million euros to finance more than 45,000 new charging points by the end of 2023 (Advenir project, 2020).====Investigating the key factors that are interconnected with BEV and PHEV uptake is crucial to accelerating the French electric mobility transition. Several studies evaluated the relationship between socio-techno-economic factors and the PEV purchasing activity using empirical methods, such as Vergis and Chen (2015) in the U.S., Wang et al. (2017) in China, Mersky et al. (2016) in Norway, and Münzel et al. (2019) for a global review. Yet, several factors are still unexplored in the existing literature. First, as the influence of market-booster factors differs significantly between countries due to different consumer behaviours (Münzel et al., 2019), the French local-based case study is still lacking and needs to be considered to help the government attain ambitious national targets. Second, while the study on the influence of government policies has received widespread attention in the literature (Hardman, 2019; Jenn et al., 2018; Münzel et al., 2019), the link between purchasing subsidies and PEV sales is analyzed in the literature as a constant variable. Indeed, an adjustable measure of subsidies concerning the price of the purchased vehicle is still lacking, as the vehicle's investment is essential to capture the battery packs' cost variation. Third, charging infrastructure proved to be an essential factor in boosting PEV markets (Li et al., 2017, Plötz et al., 2016). Still, the literature considered charging infrastructure as one covariate and failed to mention that different charging speeds are available. Therefore, the potential impact of different-power charging infrastructure on BEV/PHEV demand is still missing (Morganti et al., 2016). Fourth, previous studies did not include a variable describing a vehicle's electric range, which could be an essential factor in solving the range anxiety problem, especially for BEV drivers and understanding the customers' choice towards different-size vehicles. The novelty of our study will be to: (1) consider the department-level French case, (2) study the relationship between several new covariates (different-power charging infrastructure deployment, the French department-level subsidies concerning the vehicle's price, the vehicle's electric range) with BEV and PHEV sales. We also contribute to the scarce literature, only considered in (Vergis & Chen, 2015), that suggests BEV and PHEV markets respond to different market shares' boosting strategies by evaluating how the studied factors vary between the two markets.====This paper seeks to fill these gaps by assessing the privately-purchased BEV and PHEV market shares, separately, using a mixed-effects regression on a local level in France from 2015 to 2019, taking into account the charging infrastructure deployment of different power speeds and other socio-economic factors. The data of these 21 covariates were gathered from various governmental and press sources and allowed us to build an original and recent database of 94 French states spanning five years. These covariates could vary within three dimensions: the French-local level, the year, and EV type. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to isolate the impacts of local-level incentives regarding the vehicle's price, the vehicle's electric range, and four charging powers on the adoption rate of BEVs and PHEVs separately in France. Also, our work differs from existing studies in using mixed-effects regression that captures the effect of time-variant and constant covariates. It should be noted that methods applied in our study could help the French government build a clear roadmap for electric mobility transition by identifying the market-booster factors and concluding with policy recommendations rather than definitive causation.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an extensive overview of econometrics studies on PEV adoption. In Section 3, we describe the data and methodology used.

These costs are determined by the choice of battery size and charging infrastructure. In addition, the electrification of public transit buses raises questions regarding the fleets’ punctuality toward their pre-defined schedules, due to the possible schedule delays resulting from BEB charging. In this context, this paper presents a methodology to assess the techno-economic performance of BEB fleets for different battery sizes and charging infrastructures and strategies. The proposed methodology is based on a detailed ==== (TCO) model considering purchase, operation, maintenance, and infrastructure costs. In addition, a punctuality index (PI) is introduced to quantify schedule delays due to BEB charging events during the day. A case study is used to illustrate the model and results show that overnight charging has the highest TCO, 13% higher than the TCO observed during end-line or opportunity charging. Moreover, a clear trade-off is observed between TCO and BEB punctuality to their schedule. Results show that there is significant room to reduce the TCO of BEB while respecting their operational constraints, by co-optimizing the battery size and charging infrastructure.","Despite the significant environmental benefits and high energy efficiency of battery electric buses (BEB)(Haddad et al., 2019; Tirachini & Antoniou, 2020), their market share is still relatively limited in most markets, making up less than 11% of the newly registered city buses in Europe for example (Basma and Rodríguez, 2021; Bieker et al., 2020). This is mainly driven by the higher bus purchase costs and limited driving range in comparison to other bus technologies. The BEB high cost is mainly due to the expensive Lithium-ion battery technology which almost comprises one-third of the total bus cost. Although there has been a significant reduction in the cost of lithium-ion batteries over the past decade, it remains a relatively expensive battery technology for the foreseeable future (Tsiropoulos et al., 2018). On the other hand, the driving range limitation of BEB creates a problem of range anxiety for operators and raises questions over BEB reliability for daily transit activities (Feng and Figliozzi, 2013), especially with the relatively long battery recharging time when compared to energy refueling for other bus technologies (Miles & Potter, 2014).====Therefore, the choices of battery size and charging infrastructure have a direct impact on the total costs and driving range of BEB (Liu & Wang, 2017). Buses equipped with large batteries, which are mainly charged by slow chargers at the bus depot during the night, benefit from prolonged driving range but suffer from high battery acquisition costs. On the other hand, BEB equipped with small batteries are subject to short driving range and they require frequent charging during the day at high power rates (Basma et al., 2021). This results in high infrastructure costs due to the need for multiple charging stations along the bus route (Lajunen, 2018), with corresponding challenges in the planning and scheduling of bus operations. In addition, the bus energy costs are also impacted by the choice of charging infrastructure and strategy such as charging time and frequency during the day and charging power used, as most countries impose varying electricity tariffs during the day (Rupp et al., 2020). Moreover, the charging strategy also affects the battery replacement costs due to the different aging phenomena resulting from battery charging frequency and power rates (Houbbadi, Trigui, Pelissier, Redondo-Iglesias, & Bouton, 2019). Thus, it is important to address BEB cost and driving range problems with proper battery sizing coupled with appropriate charging infrastructure and strategy, while taking bus operational and service requirements into consideration.====Charging the BEB exclusively overnight eliminates any risk of schedule delays due to charging during operation, however, the risk of running out of battery power becomes high since there is no provision for charging during the day. Conversely, frequent day-charging lowers the risk of range problems, whereas the risk of service delays due to charging becomes higher. Therefore, proper battery sizing and charging strategy are critical to ensure an uninterrupted operation of the BEB fleet.====At the same time, the BEB fleet operating conditions affect the bus energy consumption (Wang et al., 2018) and impose constraints on the BEB charging needs during the day, such as charging location, frequency, time, duration, and power (Liu & Song, 2017). These operating conditions include driving and weather conditions, passenger occupancy, and schedule. It has been shown in the literature that bus energy consumption is very sensitive to the encountered traffic conditions and passengers’ occupancy during its daily operation (Basma et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Lajunen, 2014; Zhou et al., 2016). In addition, extreme cold and hot weather conditions may double the bus energy consumption due to the high heating and cooling needs inside the bus cabin (Al Haddad et al., 2020; Basma et al., 2020). On the other hand, the bus schedule dictates the possible charging events during the day and their corresponding duration. Hence, the BEB operating conditions should be considered in the choice of charging infrastructure and battery sizing (Shen et al., 2019).====In this regard, the main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of battery sizing and the choice of charging infrastructure on the costs and operation of a BEB fleet, while considering their real-world dynamic operating conditions. This paper realizes the following main contributions:====Across the recent literature, several studies evaluated the economic performance of BEB for different battery sizes and different types of charging infrastructure. Most of the studies focus on a specific type of charging infrastructure while partially assessing their economic performance. (He et al. (2019) and Qin et al. (2016)) analyze the economic impact of deploying BEB while only considering the operating costs of the public transit bus fleet under opportunity charging scenario. Houbbadi et al. (2019)) and (Rogge et al. (2018) assess BEBs total cost of ownership for depot charging scenarios. Lin et al. (2019)) focus on reducing the power cost of electricity for fast-charging stations only. Vepsalainen et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2020) consider several configurations of end-line charging exclusively, analyzing their corresponding operating and capital costs. Teoh et al. (2018) assess the economic performance of a BEB considering a single charger along the bus route. On the other hand, studies that analyze the comprehensive economic performance of all types of stationary charging infrastructures either use simplified analytical simulation tools (He et al., 2019; Lajunen, 2018) or use numerical simulation approximation (Li et al., 2019; Pelletier et al., 2019) that cannot adequately capture the real-world operation of BEB fleets.====Furthermore, very few studies evaluate the operations of BEB for different battery sizes and charging infrastructures to assess their impact on the BEB schedule delays. For example, Gao et al. (2017) estimate the BEB lost drive time due to proactive charging all year-round, while (De Filippo et al. (2014) analytically estimate the BEB queueing time at a station using only a fast-charging strategy along the bus route. Uslu & Kaya (2021) and An (2020) propose an optimization approach to locate and size opportunity charging stations for a BEB fleet based on the bus waiting time. Tang et al. (2019) propose robust BEB scheduling strategies to avoid en-route breakdown. None of the mentioned studies introduce a comprehensive framework for assessing BEB fleet operations and schedule delays for different battery size and charging infrastructure choices.====An accurate estimation of the BEB energy consumption is critical in order to evaluate its techno-economic performance. Most studies consider the BEB energy consumption as constant energy quantity per driven km (Bi et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Mahmoud et al., 2016). Other approaches use a sample of real-world data and estimate the average BEB energy consumption all-year-round (Miles & Potter, 2014; Qin et al., 2016; Teoh et al., 2018). Still, others specify the BEB energy consumption as function of the bus type (bus length and battery size) (He et al., 2019; Rogge et al., 2018; Vepsalainen et al., 2018), while very few develop energy consumption models for BEB such as De Filippo et al. (2014); Lajunen (2018); Sebastiani et al. (2016). These models follow a simplified approach of calculating only the propulsion energy consumption while ignoring the significant energy needs for the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC), and the other auxiliaries encountered in BEB.====Therefore, this paper proposes a techno-economic model for evaluating the real-world energy needs of a BEB fleet within service schedule constraints, while considering the comprehensive economic performance of the main types of stationary charging infrastructures for different battery size choices. This includes battery acquisition costs, energy consumption, and demand charge costs, charging infrastructure costs, and battery replacement costs. The model considers the comprehensive energy consumption of BEB including all energy systems such as propulsion, HVAC, and auxiliaries.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the methodology, which is composed of 3 main parts, the BEB fleet energy model, the total cost of ownership, and operations.

Firms all over the world tried to protect their employees and prevent further spreading of the virus by minimizing human interaction at the workplace. Employees were advised to work from home if their work is suitable for telecommuting in order to continue business activities and avoid bankruptcy on the long run. But before the Covid19-pandemic, telecommuting has been controversially discussed in firms and in the media, although it has been of an increasing relevance for firms and their employees. According to Statista Research Department (2019), the share of German firms offering their employees the opportunity to telecommute has been 22 percent in 2014, 31 percent in 2016 and 39 percent in 2018 in a study of the year 2019 while a majority of 64 percent of German employees are in favor of telecommuting becoming a legal right for employees in 2020 (Statista Research Department, 2020).====But despite the importance of telecommuting nowadays, both researchers and practitioners argue about the consequences for employees and firms. While the effects of telecommuting on productivity have been ambiguously discussed for a long time, the impact on innovation has only become a major issue since Yahoo’s CEO Marissa Meyer called all telecommuters back to the office beginning in June 2013. The reason for that was the attempt to increase employee interaction with the aim of boosting innovation in services, an innovation Yahoo desperately needed back then. With this strategy, Yahoo tried to out-innovate competitors like Google and stay competitive overall (Sullivan, 2013) as, according to ====, the top valuable companies in 2013 and, still today, are serial innovators of the service sector like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. According to a consulting press article of Sullivan (2013), employee interaction should not happen through scheduled meetings in an attempt to increase innovative activity in services. Instead, it is casual interaction between employees of all departments of the firm that is supposed to foster the exchange of relevant information for the process of service innovations, thus increasing the competitiveness of firms. Telecommuting prevents such casual interactions and will severely deter this kind of information exchange between employees. Yahoo’s decision was criticized by many CEOs of other companies, who have been supported by Micheline Maynard in a press article for ==== in 2013. She argues that telecommuting gives employees a certain autonomy to decide when and where to work and, most importantly, that it gives them enough unstructured time to think and reflect. This unstructured time leads to more creative insights that are more likely to result in innovation than, say, a brainstorm resulting from fixed appointments. Furthermore, the autonomy that comes along with telecommuting has a motivational effect on employees that makes them more happy and creative and also contributes to innovative activity in services (Maynard, 2013).====This paper aids the understanding of a significant paradigm change of the global workplace organization. In this respect, this paper focuses on an econometric analysis of the impact of telecommuting on service innovation using individual-level data of the German workforce, which stems from the BIBB/BAuA Employee Survey of 2006, containing representative information on 16,151 German employees. As an analytical framework, a Probit model is employed with “service innovation” as an outcome variable and telecommuting and its intensity as the variables of interest, as well as an instrumental variable regression using Lewbel’s instrumental variable methods with generated instruments.====The representative results of the Probit estimation show that the innovative activity of employees can significantly be enhanced by allowing employees to telecommute. Especially frequent telecommuting has the biggest positive influence on service innovation. Lewbel’s instrumental variable methods with generated instruments confirm the results and indicate that telecommuting has a positive impact on service innovation and that this impact is highest for frequent telecommuting, and this impact is even bigger for women compared to men. Policymakers could set incentives for firms to allow telecommuting and for employees to make use of it by translating telecommuting into law, in such a way that employees can make use of it if they want or need to. Firms could encourage their employees in telecommuting and invest in the appropriate infrastructure. This might help firms to stay innovative and ensure their competitiveness on the long run. In addition, in times of certain crises, especially during health crises like the Covid19-pandemic, firms do not need to stop their business activities completely, but are able to continue by allowing their employees to make use of telecommuting if possible.====Despite the economic relevance of telecommuting during the Covid19-pandemic and the prominent position it has achieved as a key flexible work arrangement, there is hardly any economic literature available on the topic of telecommuting and service innovation, as the existing literature is only indirectly related to telecommuting and service innovation. The drawbacks and benefits of telecommuting and its vague and indirect impact on service innovation, are ambiguous in the existing literature. Telecommuting is a type of organizational change and a study by Nijssen et al. (2006) shows that organizational changes are relevant for service innovation. This study is backed by Cozzarin (2016) who shows that organizational change impacts product and process innovation in a positive way. A further empirical study by Lee et al. (2010) shows that a high geographical proximity of scientific researchers is positively related to their published articles, which can be interpreted as a special type of innovation. The study of Karia and Asaari (2016) indicates that telecommuting leads to the development of resources that are beneficial for innovation and competitiveness.====Therefore, it is a key empirical question whether there is a positive or a negative direct impact of telecommuting on service innovation. This study aims at filling this gap with econometric evidence for Germany as, according to Kagermann et al. (2016), the diffusion of ICT and the degree of digitalization in Germany is supposed to be among the most advanced ones compared to other countries. This enables countries like Germany to be able to provide the appropriate technical infrastructure for firms to offer the opportunity of telecommuting to their employees. In contrast to other studies related to this topic, the dataset used for this analysis is representative and allows an extrapolation of the results to the general workforce of the country. In addition, this econometric study analyzes if a causal relationship on this research question can be found. Representative databases are currently best available for Germany and allow a first step for an international comparison once representative data for other countries are available as well. The fact that telecommuting is a relevant driver for service innovation in Germany is also important for other countries as there is a global trend towards an increasing importance of services and the service sector in general (Buera & Kaboski, 2012).====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the theoretical background and an overview of the literature related to telecommuting and its indirect impact on innovation. Section 3 presents the analytical framework and the estimation approach. Section 4 describes the database and gives descriptive insights. The estimation results are also presented in Section 4 while Section 5 concludes and gives practical implications.",Does telecommuting kill service innovation?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000282,24 May 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

Typical households in the middle- and lower-income bracket would benefit most from these policy instruments.,"Most of the transport sectors in the Brazilian economy have undergone reforms since the 1990s, leading to structural changes at the regulation, operation and competition form. Tariff and cost structures have changed with the promotion of some microeconomic policies, expanding the demand for some transport modes and the possibilities of intermodal competition over the past 20 years, such as between subway and city bus services, as well as public and private transport. The recurring subsidy policy for subway services has been causing distortions in prices for urban bus services, which induces substitution between these modes by households. Nevertheless, the per capita income growth, credit policies and cost measures for the purchase and use of private vehicles also have contributed to a shift in modal distribution across the country, increasing the household preferences from all income strata for private transport over public passenger services.==== Among the measures to stimulate the acquisition and use of private vehicles, we can highlight the reduction to zero of automobile production tax (known as IPI zero), the low price of licensing and property taxes on motor vehicles (IPVA), the direct subsidies such as free parking on public roads and the decrease of the Economic Intervention Contribution (CIDE) tax on fuel – CIDE-fuels (Carvalho & Pereira, 2012; Castro, 2003; Cibulska et al., 2012; Farranha & Frezza, 2014; Rolim & Brasileiro, 2009).====As a result of these policy measures, transport has become a typical consumption item in the Brazilian family budget, reaching a close share of the main expenditure item, that is, foods. According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey (POF), 2008 and 2009, elaborated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the average monthly expenses with the transport service reached 419 BRL, a portion very close to food (421BRL), equivalent to 16.1% of total household expenses. Of a total of 58 million Brazilian families, 76.5% of them spend their expenses on urban transport, being 25.1% on public services and 29.8% on private transport. About 46.1% of total spending on ground passenger services is concentrated in families with up to 2075 BRL per capita income, the equivalent of five minimum wages. In general, poorer families are the biggest demanders of public transport, while higher-income families demand more private transport (IBGE, 2010b).====Notably, the Brazilian experience has prioritized private transport and changed household spending patterns regarding the use of private vehicles. However, the political measures also have generated redistributive effects of income and consumption on the economy, which are hardly considered in their analysis or applied studies for Brazil. Especially the CIDE-fuels==== represent a national diesel and gasoline tax that since 2001 has gone into a trust fund that finances the nation's interstate highway system and other roads, as well as environmental projects related to the oil and gas industry, and subsidizes the transport of ethanol fuel, natural gas, oil and derivatives. Even with all these financing links, the tax revenues collected are not used for these purposes and does not fulfill its social function (Lacerda, 2005; Morais & Costa, 2010; Vinha, 2006). Consequently, without this compensation, and by raising costs of public bus transport and the private transport differently, this fuels tax can promote intermodal substitution and significant redistributive effects between poorer and richer households, even widening income inequality and the use of private vehicles in the country. This concern has been recurrent in the debate about the CIDE-fuels and Carvalho (2016) and a Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC)==== of 2007 suggested that part of the tax collection from gasoline subsidizes the provision of public transport services. With this policy instrument, it would be possible to cross-subsidize between private and public transport, as well as cheap bus fare and the competitiveness of public services against private transport (Carvalho, 2016).====Nevertheless, the redistributive effects of both the cross-subsidy proposal and CIDE-fuels depend on the relative position of a typical household in the distribution of income and expenditure by a transport type. For example, raising diesel taxes should make public transport more expensive and cause a shift in the budget constraint of poorer households by the income and substitution effect – reduction of other consumption items (Gomide, 2005). This direct change in the consumption pattern has impacts on the production and the relative price structure, and the remuneration of primary factors, whose income and price changes indirectly, may further restrict the budget of certain household groups and even widen income inequality. Moreover, the tax policy directly impacts production costs of more road-intensive sectors or diesel input in an economy, making the change in household income and consumption distribution more intense. Thus, this type of impact analysis on the overall economy is a complex task, since it includes direct and indirect channels, requires great attention to the relative position of the household groups and involves a theoretical framework that presents expenditure and income links between different economic institutions: households, productive sectors and public administration. These characteristics and relationships have been little explored in economic models for transport policy analysis (Steininger et al., 2007), and no applied research stresses the long-run economic repercussions of the CIDE-fuels and cross-subsidy proposal in Brazil.====Our paper contributes to filling this gap and analyzes the economic deviations and redistributive effects on household groups of both policy instruments from the Brazilian baseline forecast path up to 2030. In addition, it assesses the short (2011–2017), medium (2011–2025) and long-run (2011–2030) term economic effects of two fuel policies. The research simulates a withdrawal of the CIDE-fuels in scenarios with and without cross subsidy between 2011 and 2017, which gives us the role of these policy instruments. To do so, we propose the development of a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates flows of the Brazilian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) in its theoretical and data structure, recognizing in detail the passenger land markets. The literature discussed in third section presents several studies that used this methodology to assess the economic effects of policy implications on passenger transport (e.g., Hesenler & Maisonnave, 2018; Verikios & Zhang, 2015b; Tscharaktschiew & Hirte, 2012; Xu et al., 2018) and also discuss fuel taxes and fuel subsidies and biofuels (O'Ryan et al., 2005; Phomsoda et al., 2021; Alshehabi, 2012). Guan et al. (2021) focus on public transport subsidy policy to encourage households to travel by bus. In this case, the authors analyze a monocentric city with two income classes. Other recent studies have adopted other methods and evaluated the relationship between the market share of public transport and taxation (Barros et al., 2021), with an alternative model of property tax that provides financing for public transport (Leontev & Leontyeva, 2021). Barros et al., 2021 found that a lower value added tax (VAT) rate on public transport fares and a higher tax rate on vehicle ownership can lead to an increase in public transport market share. Perl and Burke's (2018) study compared the long-term adjustment of transport financing instruments in the US and Australia. In a recent study, Adagunodo and Oladeji (2020) examined the effect of petroleum product prices on household welfare in Nigeria and concluded that poor households do not react in the same way as rich households regarding petroleum products consumption. The difference between our research and other studies is the treatment of the database with the disaggregated of passenger transport services, in addition to the model considering the different economic environments in terms of government budget behavior and specific fuel policies for Brazil. The model incorporates methodological contributions such as the SAM disaggregated by 10 types of households by income range and by 4 passenger transport services, the mechanisms of recursive dynamics and a theoretical specification in the demand of households that captures substitution effects via price between the private and public transport, and also between urban bus services and train/subway.====Besides this introduction, this paper is comprised of four other sections. The second section briefly reviews previous CIDE-fuels. The third section presents some applied studies with CGE models for transport. The fourth section describes the dynamic CGE model, namely, the BIG-TP (Brazilian Income Generation and Transport of Passengers). The fifth section presents the conclusions and remarks of the research.","Fuel tax, cross subsidy and transport: Assessing the effects on income and consumption distribution in Brazil",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000270,15 May 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

How dangerous is it to move around a certain ","Mobility and population density are among the most distinguishing features of contemporary cities, at least in the most developed parts of the world. The outbreak of COVID-19 is now threatening this development model, since policy-makers are attempting to curb the spread of the epidemic using, among other options, social distancing and restrictions on mobility. The effectiveness of these measures has been extensively examined, and there is consensus regarding their importance in reducing the speed of diffusion of the virus (====; ====; ====). However, policies designed to contain virus transmissions are very heterogeneous, since they may involve (among others): school closures, workplace closures, cancellations of public events, restrictions on gathering size, closures of public transport, stay-at-home requirements and restrictions on internal movements (====). Public transport, in particular, has suffered capacity restrictions designed to both reduce individual mobility and support social distancing, leading to significant changes in the planning of transit services (as extensively reviewed by ====) and new demand management methods (====). In this article, we aim to contribute to the ongoing policy debate by investigating the spatial association between transit==== usage and the initial diffusion of COVID- 19 in Italy, one of the countries most severely hit by the first wave of the pandemic.====). Thus, the boundaries of the LLMs do not reflect any administrative principles; rather, they are shaped by social and economic relations, which makes them very informative and more comparable for analysing overall mobility patterns as a whole (====).====The spread of COVID-19 is measured by daily excess mortality between 1 January and 30 June 2020, a range spanning from nearly two months before to nearly two months after the most critical part of the first pandemic cycle. Then, we measure transit usage relying on data from the latest country-wide assessment of mobility for Italy, conducted in 2011. Our methodology combines these variables in a model estimated with panel ==== to allow for the wide heterogeneity of the impacts of mobility and transit usage on the initial spatial diffusion of the virus.====Our findings point to a statistically weak association between COVID-19 diffusion and “pre-existing” transit usage. In particular, we did not find that places in which commuters were more prone to use public transport were more severely affected by the first wave of the epidemic. Regardless of the type of transport use, however, our empirical analysis does confirm that the primary contributor to the first wave of the pandemic was the intensity of people's movements.

The airline ==== is participating actively in digital innovation due to its cost structure, security dependence and competition intensity, to improve customer experience and financial performance. Therefore, this paper investigates passengers' experience on current and latest digital infrastructures applied in different stages of a flight by using the survey questionnaire. The paper separates the methodology and analyzes the survey results from qualitative and quantitative methods. Then the survey data is used to discuss how passengers are influenced based on different indicators, such as age groups and annual flight time. According to survey respondents’ evaluation, relevant problems in the airline digitalization process were pointed out and relevant suggestions were made.","Digitalization poses various advantages for industries acknowledging its scope (Vogelsang, 2010), and the airline industry is no exception. This paper focuses on the digital transformation in the airline industry in the competitive global environment and investigates the following aspects: specific digital infrastructures, the motivation of airline's digitalization and the impact of electronic applications on the aviation industry. The secondary aim is to analyse digital impact from two dimensions: how passengers are influenced in the whole flight process, and how airlines are inspired to shape it marketing strategies. Some specific indicators, such as average waiting period and loss rate, are taken into consideration to measure the functions of digital infrastructures, to optimize operational efficiency, and to improve customer experience.====With the development of the aviation industry, the competition between different companies around the world has been fiercer. Technologies have been improved a lot by innovations, and it that can transform the behaviours and use of organizations (Henriette et al., 2016). The digital transformation is one of these technological innovations in the aviation industry which led by technologies adopted as vital strategies for companies. This is also called ‘digitalization’, which defined as cultural evolution or a social phenomenon to create a new business model for companies.====During these years, the aviation industry has invested a huge amount of money and efforts for new digital technologies, including self-service equipment, web sites mobile communications, complex software packages and others (Phillip & George 2003; Milkau and Bott, 2015). Such improvement promotes the rethinking of the organization that how to improve its performance. As a result, high-tech helps airlines to provide better services to satisfy their customer and achieve greater value.====However, considered with low-profit margins, it is hard for most of airlines to start using advanced technology and replaced by traditional or less convenient technologies. Therefore, the customer-centricity has been misrepresented and underestimated (Ureula Ursula Silling, 2018). Thus, there is a need for the aviation industry to know where is the drawback and how to improve.====With the rapid expansion of social networks and mobile applications, the new era of the digital world provides a broader development space for the aviation industry to promote new business ways. Since there are multiple social media and other digital platforms, target marketing and customer analysis need to be emphasized (Alauddin, Yee & Kim Teck 2019). The analysis and investigation of the impact of the digitalization on the airline industry can help airlines adjust or generate new strategies to attract more passengers and obtain benefits. For example, airlines provide better services to passengers by introducing new electronic equipment. Through the analysis of the impact of the digitalization on the passengers in airline industry, the deficiencies of some electronic facilities or services and areas that need improvement will be reflected and the ways to change airline strategies will be promoted (Karaağaoğlu & Çiçek 2019). The ultimate goal is to improve the digital process of the aviation industry and obtain more profits.====In addition, airlines develop into the digital direction to increase their risk tolerance and profitability. Airlines can improve operational efficiency and reduce costs through digital transformation (Lampathaki et al., 2019). For example, Lufthansa realizes the simplification and automation of the operation process through digital technology, and allocates resources to other important links, so as to reduce costs and maximize profits. Besides, a study by Yoon and Yoon (2006) concluded that more and more airlines are currently expanding their ability to sell tickets online. This distribution channel reduces the commission paid to travel agents, thus reducing the operating costs of airlines and boosting revenue (Yoon &Yang 2006). Digital technology is closely related to airlines' revenue, so it is necessary for airlines to make the digital transformation.====The purpose of this article is to investigate the development of digitalization in the airline industry, and analyse how digital transformation impacts both passengers and airlines. With the airline industry becoming more and more competitive, airlines continue to seek new technologies to get self-improvement (Lampathaki et al., 2019). As one of the most valued topics at present, to what extent digitalization can impact the airline industry is worth analyzing. In addition, as one of the most important elements of the airline industry, passenger preference has a huge impact on airline performance. Thus, researching the development and impact of digitalization on the airline industry will be significant for industry development and can contribute to the existing body of literature.",Digital transformation of airline industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000099,6 April 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

Meanwhile, our research focuses on the toll-free highway policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the promoting effect of this policy on road freight in China. Three main conclusions are drawn from the study. Firstly, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an average daily drop of 0.67% in road freight volume and an increase of 0.48% in logistic cost compared to the pre-pandemic period. Secondly, the toll-free highway policy had a significant offset effect of pandemic on freight volume and price, stimulating the resumption of work and production. However, the dynamic effect shows that the toll-free highway policy is only temporarily effective rather than the long term. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the toll-free highway policy is moderated by the severity of the epidemic and the transportation distance. This paper contributes to research on economy recovery and transportation policy under the COVID-19 pandemic shock.","As a bridge between production and consumption, logistics is essential to guarantee the stability of the economy and society. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely influenced economic activities worldwide. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, many countries have imposed strict traffic restrictions (so-called “lockdown” policy) and incurred significant transportation costs (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Studies find that traffic restrictions reduce people's mobility and cause severe economic problems, such as unemployment, food crises and loss of tourists (====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, the lockdown policy brings higher economic costs than the infection itself (====; ==== ====; ====). However, most of these studies are conceptual or simulations (====; ====; ====), and very little research quantitatively estimate the loss of logistics caused by the COVID-19 due to lack of data (====; ====; ====).====; ====; ====; ====). Some researchers discussed the relationship between the 2008 recession and motorway tolls, arguing that motorway tolls play an important role in the transport economy (====; ====). As the first country hit by COVID-19, the Chinese government initiated waiving highway tolls from February 17, 2020, to May 5, 2020. The toll-free highway policy is a subsidy for road logistics. Like China, many countries have provided stimulus subsidies to road shipment when air and water shipments are significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as India and the U.S. However, there is little research on estimating the economic effects of the free highway policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate the economic effectiveness of the transportation supporting policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.====This empirical study examines the effects of COVID-19 and toll-free highway policy based on high-frequency logistics data in China. We raise the following questions: (1) What degree of loss has the COVID-19 lead to Chinese logistics? (2) Does China's toll-free highway policy contribute to the recovery of the logistics industry? (3) Are there spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the effects of China's toll-free highway policy? The paper has contributions in the following three aspects: First, we use novel high-frequency logistic data to identify the economic impact of COVID-19. This paper quantitatively investigates the impact of the pandemic on the logistics industry and the Chinese economy based on daily road transportation data in China. Second, most current studies on the response policies to COVID-19 have focused on policies to stop the spread of the virus. Evaluating the effects of prompt policies on economic recovery needs further improvement. When population mobility was restricted to prevent virus transmission, incentivizing commodity flow was critical to offset the loss of social life. We focus on the toll-free highway policy during Covid-19 and examine the effectiveness of this short-term policy in promoting China's economic recovery, trying to provide some implications to policy-makers to fight against COVID-19. Third, our study provides a new perspective for analyzing the economic effects of highway toll policies under the exogenous shock of COVID-19. The conclusions on the effects of waiving highway tolls may provide policy implications to countries trying to stimulate good delivery during the pandemic.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section ==== introduces the policy background and data.

It investigates these evaluations and summarises their methodologies and main results. Moreover, it analyses in detail the latest official Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) carried out in 2019 in Italy and investigates the criticisms formulated on this evaluation.====Our findings reveal that the tunnel project had been approved despite the lack of an evaluation that would reach the minimal requirements of being simultaneously documented, open to public scrutiny, computationally correct, based on parameters consistent with evidence, on a sufficiently detailed representation of supply and demand, and properly considering the risk of cost overruns.====. From a methodological point of view, our results confirm that there is no inconsistency in the mainstream approach of CBA, in which taxation is included in the calculation and transferred user benefits are computed with the Rule of Half.","The idea of connecting France and Italy with a modern High–Speed/High–Capacity rail line crossing the Alps emerged around 30 years ago. Since then, the Lyon–Turin project has been launched, which consists of a 270 km rail line, including a 57 km tunnel crossing the French–Italian border. The project, part of European Union EU–funded Trans-European Transport Network TEN–T corridors, aims to reduce the environmental impact of current freight and passenger transport services crossing the alpine area.====Since the project was first envisioned, it has been assessed several times. Most recently in 2019, a governmental evaluation in Italy provoked vivid debate with regard to the evaluation methods and results and was chiefly criticised among experts who formulated many statements on what a Cost–Benefit Analysis (hereinafter CBA) should or should not be. Generally, the analysis provided a negative outcome for the envisaged project, with a Net Present Value (from now on NPV) of around minus 8 billion euros. Paradoxical effects were also observed. Most strikingly, the more the tunnel would be used (at least for freight transport), the less it would be beneficial for society (OAFTL, 2019). Moreover even if the tunnel were built for free, it would still have a negative NPV. This, along with other features, generated scepticism about the project evaluation among many experts and the interested public, not to mention policy makers.====In this context, the present paper aims to scrutinise the different assessments that have been carried out for the Lyon–Turin High–Speed line up to 2019. This allows to review their results, to assess whether the project has been approved based on a proper evaluation and to analyse the methodological issues that have been raised in these assessments. Hence, this paper first reviews the previous assessments of the project, then describes the results of the 2019 CBA, and finally discusses the validity and consistency of the criticisms that were made, focusing on the most relevant, tax inclusion and Rule of Half, as they were formulated by qualified experts and scholars and relate to questions that are ubiquitous in transport evaluation.====After this Introduction, section 2 reviews the evaluation of large infrastructures and the issue they raise and reviews the results of nearly 30 years of evaluation on the Lyon–Turin project, Section 3 presents the results of the 2019 CBA and the criticisms that it met.

These platforms offer two types of savings to consumers: monetary savings from lower prices typically offered by SEPs relative to legacy providers (LPs) and hassle savings from the reduced effort and/or time that consumers expend to search, identify, and transact with providers. We hypothesize that consumers will weigh monetary savings less than hassle savings if the former is below a certain threshold, but that the opposite will be true for larger savings. We empirically tested our hypothesis using ride data from Uber (SEP) and Yellow Taxi (LP). Consistent with our assumption, the study found a threshold ride distance, 6.64 miles, below which Yellow Taxi was preferred for the hassle savings and above which Uber was preferred for the monetary savings. This paper discusses implications that are generalizable for other sharing economy services.","Sharing economy providers host digital platforms through which individuals can sell services to other individuals (Bardhi & Eckhardt, 2012; Zervas et al., 2017). Examples of these platforms include Airbnb for accommodations, Peerby for appliances and equipment, Eatfeastly for dining, and Uber for transportation. A recent survey by PwC (PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC), 2015) suggested that about 44% of U.S. consumers are aware of the sharing economy and 19% have engaged in at least one sharing economy transaction.====Due to a rising interest among consumers, the sharing economy has grown rapidly. For example, Uber entered New York City (NYC) in May 2011 and currently offers more than 46,000 cars, far exceeding the 14,000 vehicles of Yellow Taxi in the city (The New York Times, 2017). Perhaps reflecting the consumer interest in sharing economy, the modal split of Yellow Taxi in NYC fell by more than 132,000 trips – about 26% – in June 2016 from the same month in 2011 (TheNYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), 2016). Similarly, Airbnb, which had more than 50,000 listings in NYC in 2015, was estimated to have cost the NYC hotel industry $451 million in lost revenue during the 12-month period ending in August 2015 (HVS Consulting & Valuation, 2015 October 2015). The revenue of this segment of the global economy is predicted to reach $335 billion by 2025 (PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC), 2015).====The rapid growth of the sharing economy is driven by technology that has “whittled down the barriers to the formation and functioning of sharing markets by lowering or eliminating frictions in the identification, search, match, verification, and exchange” (Narasimhan et al., 2018, p. 95). These reductions offer two types of savings to consumers. The first type of savings, monetary savings, results from lower prices typically offered by sharing economy providers (SEPs) relative to legacy providers (LPs). The second type of savings results from the reduced effort and/or time that consumers need to search, identify, and transact with providers. Thus, a consumer does not have to wait for a taxi to pass by and can instead get a ride via Uber. A traveler can find an accommodation at a preferred spot in a city even in the absence of traditional hotels in that spot. Such reductions in time and/or effort result in hassle savings.====While LPs may not be able to compete on monetary savings, they can still provide hassle savings. For instance, although they may cost more, by being more readily available, traditional taxis in a city like NYC can help riders save the time that is required to wait for an Uber to arrive. Whether consumers weigh monetary or hassle savings more may, however, vary with the consumption context. For instance, avoiding the wait time for an Uber by taking a passing taxi may weigh more if the ride is short and the savings are not substantial. The opposite may be true for long rides where the difference in the cost of an Uber and a taxi could be quite large. Monetary and/or hassle savings can, therefore, be strategic variables for LPs and SEPs. As such, we empirically examine whether this is the case in this research.====The setting for this research is the ride-sharing market in which we examine consumers’ mode choices between Uber and Yellow Taxi in NYC. Specifically, we assume that consumers will weigh monetary savings less than hassle savings if the former is below a threshold, but that the opposite will be true for larger monetary savings. In particular, we investigate whether the differences in the pricing structures for Yellow Taxi (LP) and Uber (SEP) and the availability of Yellow Taxi impact consumer preferences for the two options based on the distance traveled on the ride.====The data for our investigation comes from an individual investigator who compiled the data and then made it available for research (Schneider, 2015) and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TheNYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), 2017). This Commission maintains detailed records of every ride for Yellow Taxi in the city, including variables such as the origination and termination points of the trip, the trip cost, the start and end times, the number of passengers on the ride, and whether the fare was paid with cash or a credit card. The Uber dataset contains the latitude and longitude of the origination point, date of the trip, and start time of the trip. The specific neighborhoods that we investigated were the top 100 most frequently occurring latitude and longitude combinations from where rides with Yellow Taxi originated in NYC between April 1, 2014 and September 30, 2014. To infer the availability of Yellow Taxi in each neighborhood, we took advantage of the fact that they have to be available and visible in the neighborhood to be hailed and used a one-week lagged total of Yellow Taxi rides as a proportion of all rides in Yellow Taxi in NYC as a proxy for their availability.====To investigate the consumer's mode choice between Uber and Yellow Taxi, since we have the number of rides on Uber and Yellow Taxi, we used a log-odds approach. Specifically, we modelled the probability of a consumer in neighborhood ==== during period ==== on day ==== choosing Uber over Yellow Taxi. The log-odds are assumed to be a function of the availability of Yellow Taxi in the neighborhood and several factors that can affect riders' preferences, such as the intrinsic preference for Uber in that neighborhood and in NYC as a whole, weather, time of day, and type of neighborhood. If our assumption about the relative importance of monetary and hassle savings is valid, then there should be a ride distance below which Yellow Taxi should be preferred for the hassle savings and above which Uber should be preferred for the monetary savings. We found this indeed to be the case at a threshold of 6.64 miles.====Given the potential endogeneity of the availability of Yellow Taxi, we took two approaches to assessing the reliability of our finding. First, we assumed that the availability of Yellow Taxi in each neighborhood could be endogenous with the demand for and availability of paid transportation in the neighborhood. Specifically, we recalibrated our model to include two additional covariates as proxies for demand and availability of paid transportation: number of rides taken on subways closest to the neighborhood at the time of the ride and the distance to the nearest subway station. Second, we jointly estimated a supply side equation for the availability of Yellow Taxi in the neighborhood at the time of the ride as a function of a one-week lagged availability of Yellow Taxi in the same neighborhood at the time of the ride and the demand for and availability of public transportation. We included the residual from this equation as an additional covariate in the log-odds model. The findings from both models were consistent with the findings from the proposed model and confirmed that a threshold trip distance exists below (above) which Yellow Taxi (Uber) is the preferred option.====Our study contributes to the literature on transportation economics and consumer choice in multiple ways. First, we study how monetary and hassle savings influence consumer choice between Uber and Yellow Taxi. We proposed a model that enabled us to find a threshold trip distance that provided insights to into the relative importance of monetary and hassle savings. As such, to our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate consumer mode choice between SEPs and LPs focusing on monetary and hassle savings in a single framework. Our findings offer implications for practice. First, the study findings suggest that Yellow Taxi can use hassle savings as a strategic variable to retain market share in the short distance segment, but should increase availability. Second, Uber should consider removing the minimum fare in order to compete with Yellow Taxi in the short distance segment.====We next present the relevant literature to our research and develop our framework. Then, we provide the description of our data. Following this section, we present our models and discuss our empirical results. We conclude with a summary of our findings, limitations of the study, and directions for future research.",Monetary and hassle savings as strategic variables in the ride-sharing market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000075,15 March 2022,2022,Research Article,41.0

Factors behind their limited impact are examined. Despite competition, the largest operator, National Express, has seen growing profit margins in the last twenty years. Estimates are provided for market shares and revenue yield. The issue of potential excess profits is reviewed, in the light of evidence on cost structure and price elasticity, indicating that higher fares on routes without inter-operator competition are not necessarily due to this factor ====. In terms of product offered, the main changes appear to have been in use of e-commerce and ====, rather than the physical coach service as such. Recent impacts of Covid-19 and entry of Flixbus are examined, along with other factors likely to influence performance.","The aim of this paper is to re-examine the experience of express coach deregulation in Britain since its application in 1980, particularly in the light of changes since 2010. The deregulation in Britain predated by many years liberalisation or deregulation in many other European countries, which it can be seen to have influenced, and these in turn may have application to the British case. The background to recent changes in Britain is described, and a number of research questions are addressed:====The paper draws upon established economic concepts such as price elasticity, monopoly, and oligopoly to examine these issues. It does not aim to propose new theories as such, but to provide an informed commentary on changes which have occurred, drawing on the authors’ experience of monitoring changes throughout the period reviewed, and (in one case) working within the industry.====So far as possible, changes are analysed in quantitative terms, but the scope for detailed analysis is limited by restricted availability of data in the public domain, a consequence of deregulation in a commercial market, in which operators are naturally unwilling to disclose data. Furthermore, the British government has greatly reduced collected and publication of aggregate data in this sector. Nonetheless, the broad picture in terms of patronage, revenue and profitability can be drawn. Due to the limited degree of statistical analysis that is possible and range of academic literature, references from the technical press also form a useful input to describing changes that have occurred.",Forty years’ experience of deregulated express coach services in Britain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592200004X,3 March 2022,2022,Research Article,42.0

Assumptions made regarding the VTT are arguably as important for the outcome of cost-benefit analyses (CBA) of transport infrastructure investments as assumptions made regarding the discount rate (Small, 2012). Most VTT studies account for variations in the VTT across different trip purposes, where the distinction between business and non-business travel (e.g. commute and leisure) is especially relevant. Travel time savings for business travellers have often been connected to the cost-savings approach (CSA) through the wage rate. The benefits of reductions in travel time accrue to the business owners as the saved time can now be used productively.==== For non-business travel, reduced travel time allows people to use their time for alternative activities (e.g. spending more time with family and friends). It is here that we can make a connection between travel time and income. Travellers may be willing to spend more money on shorter journey times to enjoy more time with others. More formally, the VTT is defined by the ratio of the marginal utility of time over the marginal utility of income (Mackie et al., 2003; Wardman, 2001). Both the marginal utility of income and time are not considered to be constant entities because of assumed decreasing marginal utility of spending more income and (or) time on given activities. In this paper, we focus on the marginal utility of income, which is generally assumed to be decreasing with income due to the decreasing marginal utility of consumption (i.e. satiation effects). Since the marginal utility of income is placed in the denominator of the VTT, the conjecture that the VTT increases with income is widespread in the literature.====For appraisal purposes, the relationship between income and the VTT is important for two reasons. First, for deriving nationally representative VTT measures, it is important to understand how the VTT varies across the different income (and other socio-economic) segments (e.g. Börjesson & Eliasson, 2018; Mouter, 2016). Second, CBA exercises require future VTT values to quantify the benefits of travel time savings for future travellers. Due to economic growth, future travellers are expected to have higher incomes and hence higher VTT values than current generations.====Economic theory only informs us about the direction of the rate of change of VTT relative to the marginal utility of income but not the size of such income effects (Fowkes, 2010; Hensher, 2011; Hensher & Goodwin, 2004; Small, 2012). Analysts are thus dependent on empirical evidence which typically comes from discrete choice models estimated on stated choice (SC) or more rarely revealed preference (RP) (Daly et al., 2014; Brownstone & Small, 2005, Varela et al., 2018). Whether SC or RP, the data used for such modelling work is typically cross-sectional, i.e. with observations at one point in time, allowing analysts to study the impact of income differences across people, but not the impact of income changes for the same person. Many national VTT studies find significant income effects on VTT in such cross-sectional data. Even excluding outliers, empirical evidence regarding the ==== income elasticity for non-business trips ranges from 0.25 to 0.75 (MVA/ITS/TSU, 1987; Accent & Hague Consulting Group, 1996; Arup/ITS/Accent, 2015; Fosgerau, 2005; Gunn, 2000; Wardman, 2001; Mackie et al., 2003; Hensher, 2011).====A factor that may explain the observed empirical variation in the cross-sectional income elasticity is the selection of the income variable in the underlying choice models. In these choice models, the income variable represents the (travel) budget of the traveller such that the estimated marginal utility of income captures the shadow price of the (travel) budget. Inaccurate representations of the budget constraint may produce biased estimates of the cross-sectional income elasticity and the VTT (Fosgerau, 2005).==== Four potential sources of measurement error can be identified. First, disposable income can be perceived differently by individuals depending on their knowledge of differences between net and gross income including related social benefits. Second, it is uncertain whether people consider their private or household income, or some alternative allocation of disposable income within the household. Third, it is uncertain how budget is allocated between different classes of spending, including travelling (Deaton & Muellbauer, 1980). Lastly, more data specific reasons exist. Measurement errors can be incurred as income measures are typically captured only categorically in most surveys to increase response rates, and there is ample anecdotal evidence of survey respondents falsifying the income information they provide.====This paper focuses on examining the impacts of the first and second type of measurement error. More specifically, we test the impact of using alternative representations of the income variable – based on tax implications (i.e., gross, after-tax or disposable income) and household composition and intra-household dynamics (i.e., household, equivalised household and personal income) - on the VTT and its associated cross-sectional income elasticity. We base our analysis on the SC survey collected for the 2014/15 GB==== VTT study (Arup/ITS/Accent, 2015) and study the impact of the selected income variable on the nationally representative appraisal values.====The second part of the paper moves beyond the cross-sectional income elasticity. CBA exercises require today's and future VTT values to quantify the benefits of travel time savings of travellers during the lifespan of a transport project. Due to economic growth, future travellers are expected to have higher incomes and hence higher VTT values than current generations. Limited attention has been paid to how the cross-sectional income elasticity relates to the inter-temporal income elasticity. In theory, when preferences are not subject to change over time, the two elasticities should be closely related as non-business travellers would simply ‘adopt’ the preferences of the higher income segment. In practice, the cross-sectional and inter-temporal income elasticities are, however, not consistent with each other (see Börjesson et al., 2012; Hensher, 2011; Mackie et al., 2003; Small, 2012; Wardman, 2001). Empirical evidence from meta-analyses of VTT estimates indicate that the inter-temporal elasticity of the VTT with respect to GDP (per capita) points towards a unit value (Abrantes & Wardman, 2011; Wardman et al., 2016). The latter evidence base is considered as the state-of-practice for uplifting the VTT over time with applied ==== income elasticities between 0.5 and 1, with the lower bound set out for prudency (Sartori et al., 2014; De Jong et al., 2004; Bickel et al., 2006).====The disparity between the cross-sectional and inter-temporal income elasticity on the VTT can occur for three reasons. First, the growth in the VTT over time may not arise entirely due to income effects but rather emerge due to other factors including changes in preferences, socio-demographics, journey quality, productive time use during journey, or technological advances over time. Inter-temporal income elasticity inferred from meta-analyses may therefore represent a combination of effects when these confounding factors are not fully disentangled from the income effect (Laird et al., 2013, Arup and Leeds ITS, 2017). Second, the cross-sectional income elasticity may not be constant across income groups. By relaxing the conventional assumption of a constant cross-sectional income elasticity, Börjesson et al. (2012) and Börjesson (2014) provide empirical evidence that the (non-constant) cross-sectional relationship between income and VTT remains stable between two repeated VTT studies. They concluded that the (non-constant) cross-sectional income elasticity by income group can be used as the inter-temporal elasticity. Thirdly, the disparity between the cross-sectional and inter-temporal income elasticity can be the result of measurement error in the income variable used in cross-sectional studies. Fosgerau (2005) highlighted that the first and third are plausible explanations for the observed disparity and that the two are not significantly different from each other after taking these factors into account. In the final part of the paper we continue on this line of research and show the implications of adopting the cross-sectional income elasticity as inter-temporal income elasticity for transport appraisal.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the treatment of income in the VTT literature and provides the essential information regarding the 2014/15 VTT estimation framework which this empirical work is based on. Research questions are also laid out in this section. Section 3 outlines the research methodology, while Section 4 summarises the model results discusses policy implications. Finally, Section 5 concludes.","The selection of income measures in value of travel time models and their implications for the VTT, its cross-sectional income elasticity and transport appraisal",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001402,28 February 2022,2022,Research Article,43.0

We analyze the economic ==== that over the years have shaped port development in one of the world's most dynamic regions, embracing three of the world's busiest container ports: Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Three ==== which shape the evolution of ====.====Complementarity, existing or targeted, is a necessary condition for effective port cooperation between neighboring ports (====). In addition to the development of complementary port functions and possibly the sharing of equipment and services (e.g., tugboats; pilot organizations; port community systems, management knowhow, etc.), an interesting manifestation of complementarity is ====. Here, our recommendations are: a) Hong Kong pursues foreland-based regionalization. It is therefore necessary to consolidate and enhance its status as a leading international shipping center and port cluster and support the development of high-end maritime services. Guangzhou, on the other hand, develops hinterland-based regionalization. It is therefore necessary to enhance its role in domestic trades, further improve its connectivity with other seaports, and improve further its integrated transport network of inland waterways, railroads and highways. Finally, Shenzhen pursues a regionalization model between that of Hong Kong and Guangzhou, advancing both foreland- and hinterland-based regionalization at the same time. Here, our advice to Shenzhen is to spearhead an institutional dialogue with all system-ports, aiming at enhancing the overall international competitiveness of the container port system of the GBA, capitalizing on the region's world-class advantages.","In our globalized world, ports have become key nodes in global supply chains, being critical infrastructure for regional economic development (Notteboom, 2016). At the same time, globalization and trade liberalization have significantly weakened the link between manufacturing and the location of factors of production, and have expanded markets for goods and services (Haralambides, 2017).====Regional port clusters have emerged. Their development potential has been influenced by both external and internal factors (Chen, Fei, et al., 2020). Free trade and infrastructure development have led to heightened competition amongst neighboring, regional ports, such as those of Northern Europe, Japan and Southern China. It is however becoming increasingly felt around the world that unfettered competition among neighboring ports leads to unnecessary duplication of effort and waste of scarce port resources (Ma et al., 2021). Governments understand now that infrastructure such as ports ought to be the ‘platform’ on which firms compete, but it is not (and it should not) be the subject of competition itself (Haralambides, 2002).====Competition among the ports in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Pearl River Delta) is a typical example of the above, that has called for policy intervention: On February 18, 2019, the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued the outline for the development and planning of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. This has brought the GBA into the realm of integrated regional development (The State Council, 2019). According to this, the GBA container port system is expected to follow a collaborative development pattern (Huo et al., 2018; Yang, Guo, & Lian, 2019; Zhang et al., 2021).====A ==== such as GBA, or what Haralambides (2002) has coined ‘ports in proximity’, consists of two or more neighboring ports located within a given area (Notteboom, 2016). Apparently, the economic concepts underlying such as system are heightened competition (wherever this is allowed); substitutability of services; relevant market; and the way these realities guide the development strategies of the individual ports; independently, or collectively (Ma et al., 2021). An integrated port system such as this is a system guided by the fundamental policy concern for better harmonization of port investments and their financing, aiming at specialization of port services and at avoiding the waste of scarce resources and the duplication of effort.====The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a new type of mega-city region, encompasses nine cities of the Guangdong Province,==== as well as Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR. The region is one of the most dynamic economic clusters of China and a world-class bay area of superior infrastructure and technological innovation, playing an important role in global supply chains (Chen, Li, & Wang, 2020). Compared to other world-class bay areas, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, the Greater Tokyo Bay Area and the New York Bay Area, GBA's distinguishing characteristic, which has undoubtedly influenced its evolution, is China's “one country two systems” model of political governance, explained below.====Fig. 1 shows the layout of the container port system of the GBA; one of the busiest container port systems in the world, boasting the three world-class container ports of Shenzhen (SZP), Guangzhou (GZP) and Hong Kong (HKP). In addition, the system encompasses another 12 seaports with a monthly container throughput of more than ten thousand TEU. These are Chaozhou (CZP), Shantou (STP), Shanwei (SWP), Huizhou (HZP), Dongguan (DGP), Zhongshan (ZSP), Zhuhai (ZHP), Jiangmen (JMP), Yangjiang (YJP), Maoming (MMP), Zhanjiang (ZJP), and Macao (MOP).====As can be seen in Fig. 1, the GBA container port system includes, in close proximity, the three world-class container ports of Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and a number of others of growing throughput. The ports of Hong Kong and Shenzhen are located on the east coast of Pearl River, with Guangzhou at the center of the Delta. Since losing its position as the world's largest container port in 2004, in 2019 Hong Kong slipped to the eighth place in world rankings. Conversely, once a small local port, Shenzhen has emerged as the third largest container port in the world, in the period 2013–2017, next to Shanghai and Singapore (in 2017, Shenzhen fell to the fourth position, surpassed by Ningbo Zhoushan). Guangzhou port's container throughput claimed the eighth place in the world in 2008, rising to fifth in 2019. Guangzhou's comparative advantage in domestic throughput cannot be separated from its geographic position: The port is in the center of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, backed by a vast plain, at the intersection of the domestic and international trades of South China. A dense network of inland waterways (IWT), roads and railways connect the port to the economic heartland of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, and South China. In recent years, Guangdong has achieved rapid industrial progress, moving from the lower-end of the global industrial chain to the middle- and higher-end (Schiller et al., 2015). Following the global financial crisis of 2009, and the slump in international trade, domestic trade developed faster, and the port of Guangzhou came to the fore (Chen, Fei, et al., 2020), challenging the earlier fast advances in international container traffic of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. This last fact is analyzed further below.====Compared to other seaport systems in China, the GBA is the earliest region to introduce foreign investment, and the diversification of investors in its container port system is more obvious (Yang, Guo, & Lian, 2019). Various private investors (see below) have provided not only finance but also experience and knowhow on matters of port construction and operations. However, the preoccupation of some investors with achieving short-term profitability has resulted in considerable homogeneity of port functions and disorderly competition among ports. This has deprived ports of synergistic effects and has led to low utilization and wastage of port infrastructure and related resources (Ma et al., 2021). Therefore, the analysis of the overall development pattern of the ‘port system’ that is attempted here argues for a better coordination among stakeholders, seeking to find ==== for rationalizing port investments and other resources (Wan et al., 2020).====We need to repeat here that the GBA is a highly competitive region in the container sector, with port throughput comprising both international and domestic container traffic, as well as transshipment (Hong Kong). The hinterlands of the region's three major ports, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, are overlapping considerably (Notteboom et al., 2015) and this, naturally, has led to intense competition amongst them (Huo et al., 2018). In addition to ‘fuzzy’ hinterlands, changes in international trade flows and shifts in domestic manufacturing have exacerbated uncertainty in port development. In short, under the country's earlier ==== policy of ""one city, one port"", the GBA container port system has experienced fierce homogeneous competition and poor allocation of public resources. A flurry of uncoordinated port investments followed, and this resulted in excess capacity; wastage of scarce resources; under-utilization of infrastructure; and low return on investment. Obviously, a more ‘harmonized’ approach to port development, financing, and operations was deemed necessary by the Chinese government. To that effect, we develop an integrated assessment model to analyze changes in overall port industry concentration, as well as competition patterns between individual ports (Martin, 1993; Feng et al., 2020; Notteboom, 1997, 2010; Phong Nha et al., 2020). Subsequently, the unique evolutionary pattern of the GBA container port system is analyzed in the context of port system development theory (Bird, 1973; Hayuth, 1988; Notteboom & Rodrigue, 2005; Rodrigue & Notteboom, 2010; Taaffe et al., 1963).====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the methods and theories related to port systems research, as well as the research related to the port system of GBA. Section 3 first gives the integrated container port system assessment model, and then provides a quantitative analysis of the evolutionary process of the GBA container port system. Section 4 discusses the GBA container port system evolution model and the driving forces behind its development. Section 5 presents the findings and conclusions of the study.",Economic forces shaping the evolution of integrated port systems - The case of the container port system of China's Pearl River Delta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000063,18 February 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

We made a Logit model with random coefficients which consider the heterogeneity of preference, when estimating the ","It is known that the demand for air transport of passengers in Brazil and the world has been growing significantly in recent years (ICAO, 2019; SAC, 2020). Such increase may contribute to the fact that some passenger terminals cannot bear this growing demand (PAN, 2019). Therefore, it is necessary adequate airport planning and the application of measures to promote user satisfaction.====As bottlenecks in the airline industry are emerging, it is essential to encourage efficient use of infrastructure available in the airport (Pinon et al., 2008). Due to costs, physical and environmental constraints, many airports have to cover the expected demand with their existing infrastructure. In addition, airport management will have to introduce measures that allow technological development to provide competitive advantages (Moeller, 2012, pp. 105–119).====Improving passengers' satisfaction and optimizing their operation, associated with the focus on non-aeronautical revenue, are the current targets of airport operators. Factors such as time effectiveness, processing speed, and well-distributed spaces are reasons that contribute positively to the passengers’ journey experience. Additionally, satisfied passengers tend to consume and use the service more often, adding value to the airport.====Operators decided to invest in airport technologies to contribute to passengers’ satisfaction by improving the standard level of the services offered and perceived, and raising their quality. Even more, they are investing in self-service technologies, which are becoming familiar to passengers. An example of these technologies is self-service kiosks or totems in which passengers can check-in at the airport without the assistance of an airline member.====Negri et al. (2019) discovered that passengers from three major Brazilian airports tend to use new technologies such as binary logit in the airport terminal. ElZarwi, Vij, and Walker (2017) suggest extending the results obtained through an aggregate model because they are complex to be designed for other situations. Therefore; in this paper, we use a random parameter logit modeling to try to get more information about the attributes passengers consider before using new technology in airport check-in.====Thus, this estimation implies searching for a value that represents the population's parameter. As it is an approximation, we expect to find at least three properties once it is estimated: (i) unbiased, (ii) efficiency, and (iii) consistency. The absence of bias implies that the estimator value expected may be equal to the population parameter or at least statistically significant. Efficiency reports that the variance of the parameter is as minimum as possible. Finally, consistency is an asymptotic property of the estimators and technically requires convergence in the probability of the estimator for the population parameter. The properties will only be fulfilled if the data satisfy other prerequisites, highlighting errors of minimum measures that are difficult to obtain, as these may be inherent to the data acquisition process, which is common in studies of stated preference.====In this context, the properties mentioned above can be solved by improving the estimates to totally or partially meet the expected properties of the estimators. Therefore, using all data with moderation is valid, even with unwanted problems, as they can improve the measurement of estimators and withhold relevant information regarding the decision process of individuals.====Discrete choice models involve choosing an option among a set of finite alternatives, which results in a utility function that embraces the known and unknown factors related to the decision-maker and choice alternatives (Yaylali et al., 2016). The logit discrete choice models followed an evolution in the process of estimating the forms of data acquisition. At first, the main focus was to relax the IID distribution hypothesis and reduce the problem of IIA - Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. It provided models that can describe more heterogeneous behaviors among individuals or groups of individuals, as in the Multinomial Logit, Nested Logit, and Mixed Logit models (Train, 2003). The evolution of discrete choice models (e.g., the Spatial Logit) aims to describe heterogeneity among individuals from different regions, such as the Mixed Logit. However, it is associated with the spatial structure of the model (Pinkse & Slade, 1998; LeSage, 1999; Bhat & Guo, 2002; Klier & McMillen, 2006).====In the transportation literature, logit models are commonly used to compare different ways of transport, considering the aspects of time and cost. In this study, the choice of types of check-in were compared, and the queue time and the service time were used as attributes. In both cases, an important issue is to verify the possibility of transferring the results obtained in an experiment to other regions. The study in question used data from Negri et al. (2019), collected at Guarulhos Airport, Congonhas Airport, and Viracopos Airport in the State of São Paulo. Having as an initial hypothesis that the modeling by Logit Binary proposed by Negri et al. (2019) entails a loss of generality, which makes it difficult for the results to be expanded to other regions in Brazil. In addition, the experiment was carried out in order to understand the trade-off between waiting and service times for different check-ins. As there are no financial gains in practice, we chose an experiment that escapes the traditional cost-time trade-off, but with the construction of a factorial that reflects the reality of the choices.====Therefore, this work studies the use of binary logit discrete choice models and the logit model with random parameters as an instrument to provide general results. The study for check-in has been made by data of stated preference (SP) in three main airports in the state of São Paulo – Brazil obtained from Negri et al. (2019). The results indicate that the model with random coefficients brings information gain, as they manage to capture the differences among different people. In this case, the result is that the queue time is understood in a broader way than the service time, being the latter, slightly changed from one person to another. Thus, suggesting that the random factor model is more generalizable in what was observed; therefore, more adequate than the traditional one. However, it is not possible to be transferred to other regions, as previously thought.",Analysis of the generalized use of logit models in simulating changes in decision attributes at the airport check-in,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885922000051,9 February 2022,2022,Research Article,45.0

In general, investments for the construction and the development of public infrastructures have, by definition, spatial dimension due to the fact that the latter is fixed and related to a specific location (Straub, 2008). However, the spatial diffusion of their economic effect plays a key role to the regional development, by acting on the location patterns of the business activity.==== This parameter is critical, regarding transport infrastructures, because of the significant externalities that their operation entails; externalities that arise directly from their characteristic to operate within wider cross-border inter-operational and intermodal networks. Failure to acknowledge this effect, when estimating the economic impact of transport infrastructures, may lead to misleading conclusions about the magnitude of this impact, due to the misalignment that has often been recorded between the region that is responsible for the funding and the construction of a project and the region where, eventually, its economic impacts are manifested (Boarnet & Haughwout, 2000).====Even though the presence of spillover effects regarding public-transport infrastructure has already been acknowledged by the first studies in the field of transport economics (Munnell, 1990b; Eberts, 1990), previous studies reached controversial results about their sign, magnitude and significance. This is attributed, mainly, to methodological and conceptual issues of the models adopted, resulting to erroneous estimates due to model misspecifications, simultaneity and omitted variable bias (Melo et al, 2013). The presence of spillover effects in public infrastructures using spatial econometrics has been addressed by a number of studies in the related literature (Anselin, 2001; LeSage & Pace, 2009; Baltagi et al., 2019.====In this paper, in order to estimate the spatial spillover effect of transport infrastructures on the regional output, a dynamic panel data Durbin spatial model (SDM) is employed, consisting of the gross domestic product, the net capital stock of the private sector, the employment and the net capital stock of transport infrastructures, in the Greek regions during the period analysed. The estimation of the model is conducted for several spatial weight matrix specifications, which describe the spatial interaction between the Greek regions.====The analysis in this paper spans the period 2000–2013, which is crucial for Greek transportation, since until the late 1990s investments on transport infrastructures played a secondary role in the Greek government's regional developmental policy. As a result, the domestic transportation network was inferior compared to the rest of the EU member-states, since the national authorities preferred to follow a type of “defensive maintenance” strategy, which involved only the existing network (European Commission, 1993). Moreover, transportation investments in Greece did not follow a specific developmental plan. Instead, they were subject to local demands and political decisions (Mourmouris, 2012). A significant number of transportation infrastructures (highways, railways, ports and airports) were constructed or upgraded over the last two decades with the EU's contribution. Moreover, there was a shift of interest from Athens-Attica to the funding of priority projects to the periphery: except for the Egnatia Odos motorway and Rio-Antirrio Bridge, a significant share of public and private funds was allocated to the construction of the Ionian Odos and Olympia Odos motorways. Alongside these projects, the upgrade of peripheral ports and airports received much attention.====However, the 2010 financial crisis hindered the completion of these projects. More specifically, in 2013, the cost of the uncompleted infrastructures reached the amount of €20.7 billion (PwC, 2016). At the same time though, there was a change in the perception regarding investments in transport infrastructures, acknowledging that they constitute a significant tool for regional development, due to the mitigation of the interregional economic imbalances. Furthermore, it became clear that economic development through investments in transport projects entails spatial synergies for the effective allocation of the productive activities within the country's wider district. Nonetheless, there is weak evidence of their impact on the economy. There are no ==== or ==== empirical studies over time. In this context, the present research aims to provide new empirical evidence on the impact of transport infrastructures on the Greek economy.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the literature, Section 3, describes the methodological framework, Section 4 outlines key economic and transport evidence for Greece (case study), Section 5 presents the research results.

For example, the 25% quantile of the posterior distribution of the mean of the willingness to accept an additional hour of control yielded to the utility is $4.72. However, the negative valuation of the timeframe for deferring charging is compensated by positive valuation of emission savings coming from switching charging to periods of the day with a higher proportion of generation from renewable sources.

Considering over 80 percent of international merchandise trade in volume is realized by seaports and approximately two thirds of this is completed in the ports of developing countries, the strategic status of multi-functioning and high-efficient ports for economic growth and trade development cannot be overvalued (UNCTAD, 2018). Additionally, today's port-operating field is characterized by fierce port competition, particularly in the container business sector, where decisions by liner alliances regarding container capacity deployed, choice of port call, and network restructure can determine the destiny of a container port.====In recent years, with the accelerating pace of port institutional reform, the reform of port tariffs has also quickened. According to the notice issued by Ministry of Transport (MoT) and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China on November 22, 2014, labor charges such as container and foreign trade bulk cargo handling and service charges such as ship garbage disposal and water supply shall be changed from government guided pricing and uniform pricing to market-based pricing. On July 22, 2015, MoT and NDRC of China together released the Notice on Adjustment of Ship Fees and Public Security Charge in Port Facilities, which standardized the items of ship fees, cancelled the cushion fee, and reduced the port facilities security fee for imports and exports of 20-foot and 40-foot containers to 10 RMB and 15 RMB, respectively.

A multi-port gateway region (MPGR) refers to several ports in a relatively small geographical area with a gateway function (Notteboom, 2009). Regarding the European container port system, due to the complementary and competitive relationships among ports in the same region, it is more relevant to use an MPGR as a unit of analysis as pointed out by Notteboom (2010). However, the status of a gateway keeps changing with time, for example, the increased number and capacity of seaports (Liu et al., 2013), the improvement of transportation infrastructure in the hinterland (Hou & Li, 2011), as well as the development of regional economy and international trade (Yang et al., 2016). Consequently, the port hinterland is transforming from being monopolistic to overlapped (Haralambides, 2002; Rodrigue & Notteboom, 2010). Under this background, the increasing level of hinterland's overlap has an important effect on port competition, particularly in an MPGR. Guo et al. (2017) studied the port integration problem in an MPGR by means of maximizing the social welfare for the external transport system of a closed region.====In this context, taking into consideration the possible reactions of other container ports in the MPGR, how would each container port choose its price? Although variable costs are different, container ports in the same MPGR usually provide the same service to shippers and carriers. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the price competition, more specifically the price matching strategy, between two ports in an MPGR. It is not clear whether employing price matching strategy for both ports is an equilibrium solution or not. To answer this emerging research question, we develop a game theoretical model to investigate the pricing strategy of container ports in an MPGR.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review on inter-port competition. In Section 3, we develop the game theoretical model and derive the equilibrium pricing strategies. In Section 4, we apply our model to Ningbo-Zhoushan and Shanghai Ports in Yangtze River Delta Region, China.

However, the detriments imposed on the benefits of taxi service cannot be ignored. Although the impact of on-demand ride-sharing service on taxi service has been widely discussed, how to regulate the entrant (on-demand ride-sharing service) remains controversial. Motivated by this, we analyze the effect of the price regulation on the platform's ","Many products are purchased by consumers but usually not fully utilized (Benjaafar et al., 2019). According to the report by Fortune, cars are parked 95% of the time in the US.==== Fortunately, facilitated by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the platforms in the sharing economy has emerged to utilize residual resources efficiently (Kooti et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016. Leading examples of such platforms are Uber and Didi, which have launched smartphone applications that match riders with independent drivers in real time (Conway et al., 2018). They benefits riders greatly through a low price (Shaheen et al., 2016; Shaheen & Cohen, 2018; Zhu et al., 2017), short waiting times (Krueger et al., 2016; Rayle et al., 2015), convenience (Pham et al., 2017; Acheampon et al., 2020), and environment friendly (Min et al., 2018; Jeon et al., 2020). Moreover, the platform provides services with various service levels, which could satisfy the heterogeneous requirements of riders. For example, UberBLACK features only high-end cars, as well as professional drivers. It is popular among riders who enjoy a high perceived service experience. Carpooling service focuses on low ride cost, but the service level may be low. It attracts riders who concern about the cost. Additionally, private car owners would gain additional income, thus supporting their families better (Hall & Krueger, 2015). These advantages appear to make on-demand ride-sharing service more attractive than the alternative transportation services. Therefore, the platforms have enjoyed huge success since their advent in 2009 (Zha et al., 2016).====In 2019, the daily demand of Didi in China was 24 million. The rapid growth of the entrant, i.e., on-demand ride-sharing service, poses a threat to the traditional taxi service. Taxi service was once virtually free of competition, but now is reducing the demand dramatically as the precipitous rise of the entrant. As a result, taxi drivers organized strikes (Zha et al., 2016) and claimed that the government imposed different rules on the entrant than they must follow (Diamandis, 2014; Cetin & Deakin, 2019). Hence, governments worldwide began to take various actions to regulate on-demand ride-sharing service. These actions were similar to the regulatory intervention in taxi service. For instance, Uber was allowed to operate under a new class of license called private transportation providers (PTPs) in Edmonton, Canada (Shields, 2016). In China, the regulation of the entrant mainly concentrated on the restrictions on the model of vehicles and the qualification of drivers. The vehicle size requirement alone could put 80%–90% of drivers out of business. Faced with a huge reduction in the number of drivers, the platform increased the price to motivate the eligible drivers to provide services. As Didi Chuxing does, it responds the regulation by increasing the price by 5%–10%. To a certain extent, the regulation aggravated the difficulty to hail a car. The data released by Didi in July 2017, showed that the difficulty of hailing a car in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen increased to varying degrees after the implementation of regulation.====The regulation of on-demand ride-sharing service mainly focuses on the entry restriction. As mentioned previously, the regulation leads to the increase of the platform price and the difficulty of hailing a car. Moreover, the restrictions on the qualification of drivers and the model of cars have little effect on the operation of platforms such as UCAR Inc and CAOCAO since both platforms own cars and offer the service by dedicated drivers. Considering the disadvantages of the entry restrictions, we analyze the price regulation of on-demand ride-sharing service in this research.====The operation mode of taxi service in different places is different, which could not be ignored. To be specific, taxi drivers need to pay the franchise fee in cities such as Beijing, or pay licensing fee in New York. There does not exist this requirement in cities such as Tianjin and Zhengzhou, China. Franchise fee is regarded as a fixed cost for taxi service. It increases the cost pressure of taxi drivers (McBride, 2015) under the situation with a precipitous decline in taxi demand. As a result, the revenue of taxi service is difficult to offset the franchise fee.==== In other words, the taxi drivers could not even gain positive net profit, which will make them withdraw from the market. Therefore, taxi drivers in the cities with franchise fee usually pay more attention to the net profit,==== although the entry of on-demand ridesharing service reduces the taxi demand more intuitively. They consider the competition brought by the entrant from the perspective of the profit. Since the operation cost and the price of per ride remain unchanged when on-demand ridesharing service enters the market, the profit of taxi service is affected by demand directly in the cities without franchise fee. Taxi drivers in these cities concerns about the demand changes brought by the entrant. Thus, these drivers consider the competition from the perspective of the demand. Because of different operation modes of taxi service, taxi drivers care about different indicators facing the competition of the entrant. Thus, the regulatory policy should consider different regulatory targets to realize the regulatory principle, that is, encouraging innovation and promoting healthy development of emerging industries and traditional industries.==== However, few works have considered the regulation policy based on different taxi's operation modes or, further, to propose regulation policy to achieve different regulation targets.====The principal objective of this research is to analyze the platform pricing strategy under different regulation target, with the ultimate goal of helping to provide insight on how more equitable price regulation might be developed for different types of on-demand ridesharing services to achieve the coexistence of taxi service and the entrant. We explore the platform's price decision with the price regulation according to game theoretic method of modeling. Specifically, considering different operation modes of taxi service, we propose two regulation targets, profit-based regulation (PTR regulation) for taxi service with franchise fee and demand-based regulation (DTR regulation) for taxi service without franchise fee. To examine the impact of the type of on-demand ride-sharing service on the platform price under the regulation, we consider two service types that are common in practice: high-end service (e.g. UberBLACK) and low-end service (e.g. UberX), according to the perceived service experience. In this paper, we aim to theoretically explain whether and how the government implements the price regulation to on-demand ride-sharing service and attempt to provide some new insights into the regulatory policy.====Our main findings are as follows. First, our analysis shows that under both regulation targets, the platform price is not lower with regulation than without regulation. As Didi Chuxing does, it responds the regulation by increasing the price by 5%–10%. Second, our results indicate that the impact of the regulation on the platform price not only depends on taxi price, but also depends on the difference between two services when the platform offers low-end service. Specifically, when two services are highly homogeneous and the taxi price is low under DTR regulation, the regulation does not affect the platform price. The platform price increases under PTR regulation when two services are highly heterogeneous and taxi price is low. We highlight the type of on-demand ride-sharing service influences the regulatory policy. Third, we find that the platform price with regulation is increasing in the operation cost of taxi service. Since the cooperation of on-demand ride-sharing service with taxi service such as Didi with Haibo Taxi, could lower the operational cost of taxi service by reducing the amount of empty cruising, this result implies that we can advocate the cooperation between two services to realize the regulation target. Finally, from the perspective of social welfare, we observe that the competition between taxi service and on-demand ride-sharing service increases the social welfare. However, regulation does not improve social welfare unless the platform offers the low-end service, and two services are highly homogeneous.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the literature review. In Section 3, we develop a game-theoretic model that describes the competition between on-demand ride-sharing service and taxi service without regulation, and the platform’ pricing decision is presented. Section 4 builds the competition model with regulation and derives the optimal platform's price decision. Analysis of the impact of exogenous parameters on the platform's price decision with regulation and comparison of the platform's price decision and the social welfare between different regulation targets are discussed in Section 5.

Resilience can also be defined as the adaptive capability of a system to respond to disruptions in a better way or even gain an advantage during disruptive events (====; ====). A resilient supply chain is increasingly more critical in light of a natural disaster. However, the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare supply chain has led to shortages of necessary protection, medication, and space to treat all infected patients.====Healthcare is vital to human life, and the supply chain must remain resilient in light of any event that could cause disruption. The healthcare supply chain deals with providing quality products and effective services to patients promptly with the lowest cost possible. In 2017, $3.5 trillion was spent on healthcare and 25.4 billion was spent on the healthcare supply chain in the United States (====). Healthcare bills can be expensive and seem to be rising consistently. Hospitals are looking to find areas along the healthcare supply chain where the response time can be reduced, and demand can be met consistently without failure. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms, and terrorist attacks have also forced the government to improve funding and planning for healthcare supply chain resilience in the United States (====). Apart from the natural disaster and terrorist attack, the pandemic, COVID-19 has already increased cost across the board for healthcare and led to an unprecedented amount of spending by the world governments.====Supply chain resilience is essential considering many disruptions that can happen without much time to prepare. Natural disasters and pandemics put a high amount of strain on healthcare supply chain entities and can result in the inability to provide care. The most recent pandemic, COVID-19 has one of the most unexpected and dangerous new development in 2020 that has caused much strain on the healthcare system. The length of the disruption in supply chains puts strains on all entities to do their job effectively (====). Many hospitals are deciding on who gets the care and are operating without all the necessary materials. Additionally, more people are joining the distribution workforce, working overtime, and putting their lives are risk without proper protection. There is a need to develop a resilient healthcare supply chain structure that could withstand the effect of a pandemic like COVID-19. The objective is to find which indicator characteristics are critical for keeping a resilient medical supplies supply chain in the light of a long-term disaster such as COVID-19.====Several approaches have been adopted to address the issue of the pandemic, but till the date of submission of this manuscript, the application of MCDM is not broadly discussed in the case of COVID-19. To address this gap, this paper identifies and assesses the most influential enablers to the resilience of the healthcare supply chain against COVID-19 using the proximity indexed value (PIV) MCDM approach. This paper not only identifies the most important enablers from literature and expert opinion, but it also ranks them in order of significance using the proximity indexed value (PIV) MCDM approach. The contribution of this study is summarized as follows:====The PIV method for minimizing rank reversal was developed by ====. We employ the PIV method in our study to evaluate 12 indicators that are crucial to the medical supplies supply chain in healthcare during the pandemic. Although we are primarily focused on the medical supplies’ supply chain, 3 additional significant supply chains are employed in the PIV case study. The PIV method has some benefits over other MCDM approaches. A proximity index finds the distance of each between available solutions and the worst solution. Based on the distance between alternative solution has from another alternative, a decision-maker can make a more comfortable decision on how to proceed with choosing a solution. Additionally, the rank reversal phenomenon occurs in many MCDM methods, causing the ranking to not look as expected due to the change in scaling value that occurs with normalization. Incorporation of a proximity index value into an MCDM method attempts to make the calculation values in the matrix more precise, which reduces the rank reversal phenomenon.====In decision-making problems, the situation is highly sophisticated, and the decision involves high risk as in the case of ==== selection. The PIV method used in this study takes in various ranking values for each criterion of the medical supplies supply chain to rank each indicator characteristic. The longevity of the COVID-19 pandemics strain on the availability of medical supplies has questioned the resilient of healthcare supply chain. This study fills the gap for decision-makers aiming to find an effective way to decide what supply chain resiliency enablers create a more resilient supply chain during a long-term disaster.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section ==== presents a description of previous research.

Using Santiago-like data and three levels of total demand the social cost minimizing systems are presented in the trip distribution space. Different bus-based structures are superior for most demand distributions (with a pattern rather insensitive to total patronage), except when the capacity of the bus system is reached in some section of the city or when the total number of long trips is very large. A sensitivity analysis confirms the importance of these elements, particularly in the role of the subway and in the conditions that make the feeder-trunk scheme convenient. Policy and methodological lessons emerge for extensions to a more general description of a city where lines structures enumeration is not possible.","The design of urban public transport systems is one of the most relevant and complex problems faced by urban policymakers. Complexity is not only analytical; transit design has socio-political implications that can last for many years, as exemplified by the paradigmatic re-design of surface transit in Santiago, Chile, planned and implemented during the first decade of this century with social consequences that are discussed until now. When looked at in its entirety, the problem involves many aspects like location and design of stops or stations or the availability of exclusive lanes for the vehicles to circulate. From a strategic viewpoint, however, the challenge is to find the most appropriate set of lines, their routes, frequencies, technology, and vehicle sizes considering all resources consumed by both operators and users (their time). As documented elsewhere, this strategic design in Santiago was erroneously conceived ending with a smaller than optimal fleet of larger than optimal buses organized under a feeder-trunk scheme. Although in real cases the search for strategic designs is usually done by means of heuristics over complex networks, analytical microeconomic models are helpful under two generic approaches: searching for best structures over regular networks representing a city such as a grid (e.g. Daganzo, 2010) or a circular model (e.g. Badia et al., 2014), or using manageable representations of the city capturing some features in order to represent and analyze specific transit problem, such as the microeconomic analyses of lines spacing in Chang and Schonfeld’s (1991) feeder lines model, or lines structure as in Jara-Díaz et al., (2018) extended cross-shaped network model.====Under either the regular networks approach or the problem-oriented simplified city approach, most analytical microeconomic models have considered a single mode, such as buses (e.g. Fielbaum et al., 2016) or rail (e.g. Saidi et al., 2016). Single-mode models have also been used to compare mode performance in terms of operator and users’ costs for varying levels of patronage, as in Tirachini et al. (2010a,b), Daganzo (2010), and Moccia and Laporte (2016), comparing bus, BRT, and rail technologies. Daganzo (2010) showed that BRT outperforms the rail systems on a regular square region, because the high infrastructure costs of rail preclude spatial coverage which cannot be compensated with high speed and capacity. Tirachini et al. (2010a) found that for a single line, buses and BRT are the most cost-effective modes for low and intermediate demand values, respectively. Heavy rail emerges as the best alternative only when BRT capacity is not enough to meet demand. Tirachini et al. (2010b) extended the comparison to a radial system.====As many cities operate under integrated bimodal transit networks (with fixed lines’ routes) or are expanding towards such systems, extending the analytical approach to consider two technologies would be a step to assess the presumptive advantages of potentially bimodal transit systems as part of the strategic design process. This represents a big challenge methodologically, as the number of modal combinations increases significantly regarding the unimodal case.====The objective of this paper is to explore, over a seemingly simple but meaningful linear representation of a city, the main elements behind the conception of a strategic design of an urban transit system considering the potential use of up to two technologies represented by their corresponding operators’ costs (e.g. bus-subway). The analytical model is built over a linear city (corridor) considering two technologies, and contains a periphery, a subcenter, and a CBD, where the periphery only generates trips, the CBD only attracts trips, and the subcenter does both. Demand is completely described with three parameters: total trips, percentage of trips generated at the periphery, and percentage of those trips that go to the CBD. Under this setting, all 74 possible combinations of lines structures (single and bi-modal) can be fully described and solved such that the best system can be found and conveniently represented for all cases. The linear city model considering two technologies developed here will be shown quite useful for two reasons: it permits the analysis - for all possible demand structures - of the conditions under which different (potentially bimodal) lines structures dominate, and it highlights the (new) type of problems that emerges in the design, setting the basis to move forward towards the analysis of a multizonal city. From a policy perspective, numerical results considering subway and buses (BRT and conventional) suggest a) that the advantages of subway and bimodal structures only emerge when the capacity of the buses is reached (BRT), and/or when long distance trips dominate; b) that conventional buses including lines spacing dominate nearly for all demand levels and distribution; and c) that structures involving transfers could be considered under very special circumstances, like when peripheries and sub-centers are close and when short distance trips dominate.====In the remainder of this Section a brief summary of the advancements in the microeconomic literature on the design of transit systems involving more than one technology is offered. In Section 2 we present the stylized corridor representation of a city with its demand pattern parametrically described, on which the design problem is formulated and lines structures are identified. Section 3 presents numerical solutions of the design problem for each lines-structure and finds those of minimum cost for every demand pattern, identifying the main elements in the analysis (those that play a key role in the choice of both a lines structure and a combination of technologies) and the lessons obtained, including a sensitivity analysis. Synthesis and conclusions are offered in the final section, with emphasis on the lessons to move towards the strategic analysis of bi-modal lines structures using a more general description of a city.====Considering one technology only, the microeconomic formulation of an isolated single line (Jara-Díaz and Gschwender, 2009) has been extended to simple networks to explore the characteristics of certain line structures serving different spatial and demand conditions. Chang and Schonfeld (1991) pioneered the introduction of lines' spacing in this type of approach by considering parallel lines that serve a rectangular area, where the origin of the trips is uniformly distributed over this area, but the destination is common and is located at its end; using some simplifications they obtained that both the optimal frequency of each line and the lines spacing are proportional to the cube root of the demand. The spacing of lines in the context of a more general setting has been recently studied by Fielbaum, Jara-Díaz, & Gschwender, (2020). Jara-Díaz and Gschwender (2003) studied two generic lines structures - direct lines, and lines in corridors - in a cross-shaped network. Gschwender et al. (2016) extended the simplified urban corridor from Jara-Díaz et al. (2012) including dispersion in the origins of one of the extremes to study this effect over four lines structures: direct lines, shared lines, lines with transfers, and exclusive lines. Jara-Díaz et al. (2018) used the extended cross-shaped network to study three lines structures – direct lines, hub & spoke, and feeder-trunk – including short and long trips. Models based upon regular representation of cities’ street networks have been developed as well, as in Daganzo (2010) and Badia et al. (2014), who analyzed different transit network designs over a grid and a circular model, respectively. These latter have been extended including the possibility to incorporate dispersion in their demand pattern; the grid city in Badia et al. (2016), and the ring-radial city in Badia (2020). Saidi et al. (2016) focus on radial lines and the feasibility to incorporate a complementing circular line.====The design of bimodal public transport systems involves the combination of two technologies that can be used in many possible ways. In corridors, the bimodal analysis with a microeconomic view goes back to Wirasinghe (1980), Wirasinghe et al. (1977), or Chien and Schonfeld (1998), who developed a model that jointly optimizes the design variables of a trunk rail line (length, headway and stop spacing) and its feeder bus lines (headway, line and stop spacing), serving a demand pattern with many origins and many destinations. Also, Jara-Díaz and Tudela (1993) formulated and applied a multi-objective approach, accounting for both users' and operators' benefits, to determine the price and frequency for an integrated bus-subway service with all potential trips originated in a bus corridor with their destination in some subway station. During the last decade, Sun et al. (2017) found the optimal rail length when a single bus line is replaced by a bus-train feeder-trunk structure, and analyze the effects of its transition in a dynamic model, where demand is assumed to increase from the city boundary to the CBD, with the CBD as a single destination. Also, in a feeder-trunk structure over a corridor, Sivakumaran et al. (2012) assumed a demand with a single destination, exploring how the coordination of arrivals of feeders and trunk vehicles – and the joint determination of their frequencies – reduce total costs (operators' plus users’). In a rectangular city, Sivakumaran et al. (2014) modeled bus feeder lines that intersect rail (or BRT) trunk lines and determined which structure dominates over single-mode networks (bus, BRT, or rail) for different demand densities and trip lengths. Fan et al. (2018) modeled a potentially bimodal system composed of local (bus) and express (BRT or rail) lines that intersect perpendicularly in a grid form; their model determines the optimal design of each network (bus plus the other mode) including the headway, the local and express lines spacing, and the local stop spacing. The numerical results show that bimodal networks (mainly bus-BRT) generate a lower total cost than a single-mode network for intermediate and high demand values, and that the joint search for the optimal design of the whole system is superior to the separated design of local and express services.====As seen, the microeconomic literature on bimodal structures shows some emphasis on the analysis of the feeder-trunk design (buses with rail or BRT), without considering other design schemes (including lines structures based on one technology) and the demand conditions under which they potentially minimize the social cost.",Lessons from the strategic design of a bimodal public transport system on a linear city,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001396,10 December 2021,2021,Research Article,53.0

This is due to Thailand's severe disruption of logistics and transportation systems compared with its neighboring countries. In contrast, Vietnam is the most robust because of its efficiency in the exports sector.

The predicted decline in trade services is higher and is likely to fall by 15.4 percent in 2020 as compared with that in 2019. The supply chains around the world face major disruptions and difficulties and are adjusting to the new demands and needs of a locked-down world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (====). For example, Asian countries where the greater span of global supply chains are because of their comparative advantage in production and distribution are affected e.g., China which is the ==== paused to supply industrial parts and components.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are undertaking a swift mechanical transformation in their agricultural domains which is the source of numerous ==== (====). Therefore, this pandemic has unearthed the vulnerability and risks of global supply chains by disrupting national nodes and internal supply networks (====).====). On the other hand, resilience involves the ability of speedy recovery of the system to continue operating (====). From the risk management standpoint, the risk assessment process is important for the development of a robust supply chain. The outcome of risk assessment also allows the supply chain partners know their level of risk or vulnerability. As such, they can generate the necessary risk mitigation or resilient strategies for recovery. It is important to be conscious of the features and current vulnerability levels when it comes to developing strategies to close the weakness in various operations. While developing the appropriate metrics is a difficult challenge, a major problem is neglecting the use of the appropriate metrics to develop strategies. Further, the quantification of supply chain vulnerabilities was not incorporated and aligned with the defined elements of the supply chain. This situation is aggravated by the confusion over the measurements of vulnerability, risk and resilience of which each has significantly different perspective.====Reliable metrics and statistics are required to track the vulnerability, risk and resilience of the entire global supply chain in order to maximize the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies for addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic or similar threats that may arise in the future. In this study, the main objective is to develop the metrics to assess supply chain vulnerability based on risk and resilience perspectives in the COVID-19 pandemic in the economics setting. It introduces the risk mitigation scenarios to elucidate a global trade supply chain vulnerability. This study examines two main research questions: first, the proposed metric of applying the evaluation of the economic risk and resilience-based efficiency using CoDEA and whether it is reflective of the global trade supply chain vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario? Second, is the result of the efficiency score of CoDEA method applicable for guiding risk mitigation or resilience policy for vulnerability closure in the ASEAN global trade supply chain?====). We enhanced this evaluation using the CoDEA model which is based on the traditional DEA calculation that encapsulates an intramural structure for the evaluation of the efficiency score of the supply chain (====). CoDEA avoids the intermediate measures between nodes and the virtual intermediate measure or the efficiency score of previous nodes are replaced (====). CoDEA is the alternative for the evaluation of the supply chain performance in any perspective where vulnerability can be applied. CoDEA serves as an alternative for evaluating supply chain efficiency, which is different as compared with the two or multistage DEA model. Moreover, the main advantage of the CoDEA which is a traditional based DEA method is its flexibility in choosing appropriate inputs from the crucial information pertaining to the set of DMU under evaluation. In the context of supply chain vulnerability, the supply nodes are a vital resource of a network. Therefore, the supply vulnerability which presents as the efficiency score is defined as one of the inputs of CoDEA. It represents the critical resources of the system under evaluation, which can affect the vulnerability of the entire supply chain. The prior stage vulnerability score is expressed as the output, i.e., the last node of the network which indicates the level of the robustness chain of the global trade. As such, efficient supply countries with their logistics and transport sectors and the international customers that can deliver a low vulnerability form an integral part in developing a robust global trade supply chain. This crucial factor is taken into consideration in the application of CoDEA. Our research is motivated by the need to develop a useful metric for vulnerability assessment which strengthens the scientific platform of the vulnerability discipline by providing new insights into the relationships between vulnerability, risk, and resilience. The metric addresses the whole supply chain and its outcome is to provide the necessary strategies for realizing a resilient global supply chain especially for ASEAN trade.====The properties of CoDEA are based on the CRS traditional DEA model in which each node efficiency is independent. Individual node efficiency changes have no detrimental impact on the individual efficiency of other connected nodes. In contrast, if the efficiency of the associated node is increased when CoDEA is utilized, a positive influence on network efficiency can be noticed. Furthermore, CoDEA network efficiency scores are typically greater than the overall efficiency of a two-stage process as a multiplication of stage one and stage two. We further run a simulation using the data of 24 non-life insurance companies in Taiwan (====) as shown in ====.====The production process in the non-life insurance sector is typically two-stage. The marketing of insurance is the first sub-process which involves attracting clients to pay direct writing premiums and receiving reinsurance premiums from other insurance firms. Investment is the second sub-process, in which premiums are invested in a portfolio to make a profit. Operating expenses and insurance expenses are the first stage inputs. The first stage produces two outputs: direct writing premiums and reinsurance premiums both of which are also inputs to the second stage which are namely intermediate measures. The second stage outputs are underwriting profit and investment profit.==== and ==== illustrate the results of the simulation comparing CoDEA to ==== independent and relational two-stage models. For the independent two-stage model, the DMUs computed the stage one and stage two efficiencies independently using the traditional DEA in the individual efficiency of stage one and stage two of CoDEA and are identical to the independent two-stage model. The network efficiencies of the independent two-stage model are then calculated by the traditional DEA using stage one inputs (operational expenses and insurance expenses) and stage two outputs (underwriting profit and investment profit) which avoid the intermediate measures, hence indicating that the independent model may produce unusual results for several companies (====). As a result, DMU network efficiency differs from CoDEA, which overwhelms these unusual calculations that maintains the beneficial input/output of direct writing premiums and reinsurance premiums but does not apply as intermediary measures. For the relational two-stage model, after the DMUs network efficiencies and the efficiencies of the second stage have been determined using relational two-stage approach deploying these intermediate measures. The first stage's efficiencies then are calculated by dividing the network efficiencies by the second stage efficiencies. Putting this another way, network efficiency is the product of stage one multiplied by stage two. Furthermore, the efficiencies of the different stages are interdependent and changes in one stage may impact the efficiencies of other idle stages. This does not resemble the nature of the supply chain, in which different nodes independently maintain or improve their performance since the individual efficiency evaluation is more appropriate. Furthermore, the multiply or divide rule has the potential to lower the value of network efficiency. CoDEA on the other hand, provides network efficiencies by balancing both stages' efficiency which does not provide a value lower than the efficiencies of each stage. CoDEA could generate an alternate suitable model for dealing with network structures such as a supply chain from this simulated example.",A global trade supply chain vulnerability in COVID-19 pandemic: An assessment metric of risk and resilience-based efficiency of CoDEA method,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001384,4 December 2021,2021,Research Article,54.0

While long term impacts are still subject to speculation, the immediate response of local industries need to be evaluated in order to target relevant policy interventions and to understand which economic players have been hit the most. Current paper tries to fill such gap, using the Italian Custom Agency database for verifying which trade sectors and ports suffered the most from the Covid-19 first wave. In order to achieve the research goal, all containerized import and export flows have been collected for the period 2012–2020, comparing historical patterns with the one observed in the first semester 2020. Results aim at contributing to the current understanding of the crisis’ impact and they will be used for driving future recovery plans.","The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a series of unprecedent ==== shocks in most countries around the world. The measures adopted by different countries to contain the virus led firstly to the imposition of restrictions on the movement of people and then quickly stiffened until the complete lockdown of entire regions and countries. In most countries, the first wave generated either local or national lockdowns for several weeks between March and June 2020 with the partial and progressive re-opening from May onwards until the autumn 2020 when some countries had to reinstate lockdowns and other restrictions due to the so-called second wave.====During the first phase of the pandemic, the lockdowns’ effect on regional economies was amplified by the asymmetric starting and ending dates of local restrictions, with some countries starting to have first national rules in early February (e.g. Far East countries) while others introduced lockdowns in March (e.g. European countries) or even later (e.g. American countries). These asymmetries generated different impacts on the production activities and the related trade operations, with only some activities considered essential that could continue at “business as usual” conditions. Despite this, all activities had to adopt special precautions and they rarely had the possibility to operate at maximum capacity. The magnitude of such impact is represented by a recent IMF outlook (====) that highlights a reduction in the world GDP of 4.9% in 2020, with an uncertain recovery in 2021 depending on the evolution of the pandemic: the same outlook stresses how in 2009, after the world financial crisis, the world GDP dropped only of 0.1%, highlighting the different magnitude of the two crises. ====), making the smoothness of the production process of finished goods a strategic activity for the Italian economy.====Given these premises, the first wave of the pandemic in Italy can be used to study the variations suffered in ==== and the related impacts that a partial or complete closure of either domestic or foreign markets can generate on specific industrial sectors.

In 2020, the Brazilian sugar-energy sector was negatively affected pandemic's spread, and the industry saw demand for one of its most important products, ethanol, shrink. This came after the demand for ethanol had increased since early 2000 (Gimenez, Altopiedi, Carballo, Silva, & Liria, 2018). The sugar-energy sector has traditionally had great importance in the Brazilian economy, with more than 380 mills producing ethanol, sugar, and electricity.====According to Santos, Garcia, and Shikida (2015), the creation of public policies and programs by regulatory agencies was essential to the development of Brazil's ethanol industry. Brazil has instituted different incentive programs to support this industry, with ProÁlcool and RenovaBio being the most important (ANP, 2020a). Both programs helped develop the green-fuel domestic market while promoting the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet aggressive goals.====ProÁlcool (1975–1985) was a government program designed to promote a shift from fossil fuels as a vehicle energy source to alcohol (ethanol) as a response to the oil crisis that began in 1973. The crisis caused international oil product prices to rise substantially and resulted in an increase in gasoline prices in the Brazilian market, a fall in global sugar prices, and a concurrent decline in sugar mill profitability (Karp et al., 2021; Santos et al., 2015). Among other initiatives, the program offered support for the development of vehicles that could run on alcohol, gasoline, or a combination of the two; invested in infrastructure; and provided subsidies to promote an ethanol supply increase (Natale Netto, 2007).====In 2017, the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) was instituted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) (ANP, 2020a). It encouraged biofuel production and authorized the sale of decarbonisation bonds called “CBIOs” to foster an increase in ethanol's share in the Brazilian energy matrix. The number of “CBIOs” that can be traded by a mill is a function of the volume of their ethanol sales and the RenovaBio Energy-Environmental Index value (ANP, 2020a) with this value acting as one variable in the determination of how many carbon-credits an ethanol producer can sell to fossil fuel distributers to compensate for the GHG emissions generated by combustion of the fuels they sell. Only RenovaBio certified mills can issue CBIOs.====Due to flex-fuel vehicles' extensive share of the Brazilian passenger vehicle fleet, the country's ethanol industry's ability to increase sales is strongly related with the fossil fuel market (DENATRAN, 2020). As in many other markets, the demand for ethanol in the Brazilian market was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures and reduced international oil prices caused gasoline prices to fall (Wang, Shao, & Kim, 2020), biofuel consumption to decline (Elleby, Domínguez, Adenauer, & Genovese, 2020), and negatively impact the entire sugar-energy sector.====Any shift in the fuel matrix to increase fossil fuel participation at the expense of green fuels has externalities far outside the sugar-energy sector itself. Literature shows that the use of green energy in logistics operations reduces emissions, thereby improving economic performance and the public's health and that environmental performance is negatively correlated with public health and public health expenditures (Khan et al., 2019; Khan, Zhang, Kumar, Zavadskas, & Streimikiene, 2020).====Because green fuels are economically relevant and directly affect the environment, there is a wide and urgent need to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the sector to guide supply chain recovery and aid in planning. To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on any economic sector through the Double Frontier Slack-Based Measure Malmquist Productivity Index (DF-SBM-MPI), a state-of-the-art Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool. Also, Khan, Yu, Golpira, Sharif, and Mardani (2021) wrote about a lack of studies considering the macro-level to explore new synergisms in Sustainable Supply Chain Management. With this in mind, the study presented in this paper was intended to fill that gap by analysing the impacts of COVID-19 on Brazilian ethanol (green fuel) supply chain performance and how the different Brazilian ethanol-producing states were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. An innovative interpretation of the Double Frontier Slack-Based Measure Malmquist Productivity Index (DF-SBM MPI) was employed to investigate the ethanol supply chain's resilience and performance in each producing state.====Data from 2019 to 2020 were gathered to measure the pandemic's impacts, knowledge which should prove to be of assistance when guiding the supply chain's recovery. These data included social isolation index statistics, the number and locations of ethanol producing mills, ethanol prices at gas stations, the amount of cane used for ethanol production, ethanol sale prices and volumes, and Energy-Environmental Index figures from RenovaBio: the variables included in the modelling process. The relevance of these factors as measures of economic, social, and environmental performance—the three pillars of sustainability—is unquestioned, and as such are valid measures of Brazilian ethanol industry performance.====We divide the paper into four additional sections.

It is a primary fact in cutting-edge manufacturing that demand, supply, and personnel availability have been influenced by means of this pandemic globally at an identical time (====).

Due to the severe effect of Covid-19 in Europe, the factories of Volkswagen and Daimler have seized their production operations temporarily for the safety of manpower (====). The Covid-19 epidemic has forced some manufacturers for shifting their manufacturing units from severely affected locations to other less affected locations. Recently, Samsung Electronics has started some of its component manufacturing industries in Vietnam after a severe attack of corona virus in South Korea and Apple has started its iphone- 11 factory in India (====) due to the better amicable situation as compared to China.====), (====).====Further, to tackle challenges set by the corona virus, the internet of things (IoT) can be implemented in a plug-and-play mode to combat economic downturn, ensure employee safety and security. IoT can aid the transit manufacturing process in several ways, such as tackling manpower, machine-condition-monitoring, and tracking products. Economically, IoT reduces cost, enhances diagnosis, helps make effective control, and superior treatment with reduced chances of mistakes (====). The analytics gives accurate responses to large-scale data using a AI and deep learning systems. AI is getting empowered with the upward push of remarkable computing strength and huge statistics technologies (====). For example, timely and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is extracted through radiological features by the application of AI (====). Failure to do so will have a detrimental impact on consumer and institutional confidence, as well as fundamentally impair future trading capabilities and market position. Blockchain technology has been predicted as a disruptive technology that will play a significant role in managing, controlling, and, most importantly, protecting IoT devices by the industry and research community (====)The blockchain's decentralized, autonomous, and trust qualities make it a perfect component for becoming a foundational component of IoT solutions. Enterprises using IoT technologies were among the first to use blockchain technology. IoT solutions can enable safe transactions between devices in an IoT network by leveraging block chain which further can retain an undeniable record of the history of IoT smart devices (====). As it does not exist in a single location, the blockchain ledger is tamper-proof and cannot be changed by malevolent parties. All of these skills are required to enable IoT compliance and regulatory requirements. . Blockchain technology is now being actively researched as it has the potential to be a useful tool in the global arena in a variety of economic and business domains (====). The benefits of a distributed registry, such as the lack of a participant hierarchy, the ability to conduct transactions with protected personal data, and the high adaptability to various processes—from insurance operations to tracking the supply chain of goods—make this technology and solutions based on it more than relevant (====). Companies' experience confirms their ability to optimize procedures and create less expensive alternatives to existing systems (====The Covid-19 data collected in the form of epidemiological data, clinical data, or genetic data are managed and processed through AI, machine learning, and deep learning to find solutions to combat Covid-19 such as prevention, diagnosis, therapeutics, and hospital operation (====).

It can help plan the activities and provide a better experience in healthcare sectors and industries without imposing risks to workers (====). The smart supply chain can be beneficial to provide service in time especially in the healthcare and industrial domain (====). The issue of training can be accomplished by virtual reality and it helps perform daily life work during the lockdown. Digital technology is also useful for risk assessment of demand trends, innovations, and product diversification (====).====Many recent pieces of research have focused on the importance of digital technologies to solve the problems of social, economic, and environmental crisis due to Covid-19 and its impacts, but none of them have chalked out the model to revive the manufacturing industries from this precarious situation. This gap is addressed in the research which intends to develop a model to delineate the clogged channels of revenue generation within the organization due to Covid-19 impacts. It may be considered as a survival strategy as the model attempts to address the crisis of 4M's (Men, Material, Machine, and Money) and constraints like transportation during the pandemic and elucidates a pathway to create revenue for the best interest of the organization.

The findings indicate that Indian consumers' SI is significantly and positively impacted by all five constructs: subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, price, attitude, and green benefits. Furthermore, multi-group analysis is performed to check the impact of socio-demographic characteristics such as gender and age on SI.","The Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BSES), based on the European emission norms, were introduced by the government of India in the year 2000 to control the emission of air pollutants released by motor vehicles. In 2016, looking at the ever-rising air pollution, the government decided to jump directly to the adoption of BS6 from BS4 emission standards skipping the BS5 emission norms (IICTPolicy Update, 2016). However, the Indian government could implement this sixth mandate of vehicular emission from April 2020. The implementation of the BS6 emission standard can significantly control the harmful emissions as the European 6 (Euro 6) emission concept is well proven on European roads since 2012 (Heuser et al., 2017).====The air quality is continuously degrading in India and the diseases due to air pollution are rapidly increasing. The rapid growth of the population in the country has brought increment in the demand for motorized vehicles both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. This augments the pollution level and hampers the environmental balance because these vehicles produce harmful particulate matter (PM) and other substances (Guttikunda et al., 2014; Naik et al., 2017). Hence, the implementation of BS6 emission norms is inevitable for the Indian government to curb the surge in pollution levels. The Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued a draft notification about the implementation of BS6 emission standards and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas supported it and ensured the supply of BS6 fuel throughout the nation. Further, it is proposed for the implementation of emission standards to the whole nation as the introduction of these emission norms in a staggered way only to particular cities is not beneficial in the long run. It is important to have one fuel standard throughout the nation for a better and clean atmosphere. The most crucial difference between the BS4 and BS6 emission standards is in terms of PM, sulfur, and nitrogen oxide traces. BS4 fuel contains five times more sulfur traces than BS6 fuel. The BS4 fuel sulfur levels were 50 parts per million (ppm) when the standards were introduced in April 2017 while the new BS6 gasoline and diesel sulfur contents have been further reduced to 10 ppm (Sathiamoorthy & Bandivadekar, 2020). The PM and NOₓ emissions are going to be reduced by 66% and 88% respectively (Naik et al., 2017). In addition to that, the new BS6 standards will have an expansion of type approval and in-service confirmatory test requirements for both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles which will check and compare the laboratory-tested emission performance with the real-world driving condition (IICT Policy Update, 2016).====The decision of the government to switch to BS6 is going to be a challenge for both the oil industry as well as automotive industry (Vashist et al., 2017). The automobile manufacturers will have to do certain modifications like replacing electronic fuel injectors with old carburettors and adding selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel particulate filter (DPF), etc. in the engine. These changes will substantially increase the overall price of BS6 compliant vehicles. Therefore, the firms will face the challenge of producing cost-effective BS6 compliant vehicles to meet the required stringent emission norms. Moreover, the workload of upgrading BS4 to BS6 fuel has also been faced by the oil industry as they have to replace the BS4 fuel with a more refined BS6 fuel. Hazen et al. (2017) stated that high prices may push the customers away from a green product or compel them to look for other alternatives. However, Bhutto et al. (2020) found that ecologically cognizant and concerned buyers can acknowledge greater costs. In addition, the people who already possess earlier BS-compliant vehicles might feel hesitant to switch towards BS6 compliant vehicles due to a lack of incentives. Therefore, the automotive firms and government should make their policies in such a way that the majority of the population should switch towards eco-friendly vehicles (Si et al., 2020).====People indulge in pro-environmental behaviour as they are concerned for the environment or they have a belief that they can also do something to improve environmental conditions (Gan et al., 2008; Wang & Hazen, 2016). Yu et al. (2018) mentioned that people who are worried about the environment can be motivated towards specific environmental behaviors. Therefore, the green benefits of a cleaner fuel can affect the behaviour of the consumers towards BS6 compliant vehicles. Moreover, the SI of the consumers can be assessed by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). It is one of the important theories in determining consumers' intention especially in the case of environmental behaviour (Yazdanpanah & Forouzani, 2015). According to TPB, consumers' intention can be predicted with considerable accuracy from subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral controls (PBC), and attitude (AT) (Ajzen, 1991). Recently, many researchers have employed this powerful TPB in assessing the green intention and behaviour of consumers in many areas related to global environmental sustainability. They have emphasized the areas like remanufacturing (Llerena, 2011; Van Weelden et al., 2016; Y. Wang et al., 2013; Yilmaz & Belbag, 2016), green products (Yadav & Pathak, 2016), electric motoring (Sajjad et al., 2019, 2020), bike-sharing (Si et al., 2020), and solutions for emission standards based engines (Heuser et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2016). This traditional and efficient theory can be very useful and influential in the prediction of consumers’ intention and their behavior towards eco-friendly products and methods.====Chakraborty and Basu (2021) stated that vehicular and industrial emissions are the major contributors to air pollution and Sahu et al. (2021) advised to shift to eco-friendly mobility along with shifting to renewable sources in India. Consequently, the transition of Indian consumers towards stringent emission-compliant vehicles will help India in mitigating air pollution. Few studies have been done in India targeting air pollution, but these researches have focused on topics apart from switching behaviour and the intention of the consumers from BS4 to BS6 compliant vehicles. Their researches were merely on green supply chain management (GSCM) in the automotive industry (Kumar et al., 2019; Malviya et al., 2018; Malviya & Kant, 2019), the purchase intention towards electric and hybrid cars (Bhalla, 2018; Simsekoglu & Nayum, 2019), combustion emission control strategies and the health impacts of particulate pollution in Indian cities (Bharj et al., 2019; Guttikunda & Goel, 2013; Rajak & Chattopadhyay, 2020; Ravindra et al., 2013), the technical challenges and the solutions for BS6 compliant vehicles, BS6 fuels (Anchan, 2018; Barman et al., 2017; Bharj et al., 2019, 2020; Vashist et al., 2017), etc. A study that examines the SI of the Indian consumers towards BS6 compliant vehicles is missing in the extant literature. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the SI of consumers from BS4 to BS6 compliant vehicles by extending the framework of the TPB. The research on the switching behavior will help the decision-makers towards the formulation of key strategies needed to enhance the SI of the consumers towards eco-friendly mobility. Particularly, the following research objectives are addressed in the paper.====The research objectives are addressed in the following ways. Firstly, a conceptual model is proposed after thoroughly studying the literature review. The proposed conceptual model integrates the ruling factors of TPB that are SN, PBC, and AT with two additional factors price (P), and green benefits (GB) to assess the SI of consumers. Secondly, the hypotheses are established based on the proposed model and the model is validated and quantitatively tested using the structural equation modeling technique. This is an effective and sturdy technique used by many researchers like Cho et al. (2014), Hamzah and Tanwir (2021), Hazen et al. (2017), Wang and Hazen (2016), and Verma and Chandra (2018) for analyzing the intention of the consumers. The findings of this study may help the government and automotive firms in comprehending the intention of the consumers to switch towards BS6 compliant vehicles. Consequently, key strategies can be developed and implemented by the decision-makers to enhance the SI of the consumers towards eco-friendly mobility.====Further, the study is put forth in the following manner. Section 2 illustrates the conceptual framework and hypotheses development. Section 3 describes the research methodology and emphasizes the data collection.

The reciprocal interaction between demand and network assignment represents the core of the so-called integration process. Such an integration can be classified according to the features of the demand (trip-based vs ABM) and assignment (static vs dynamic) models. The integration between trip-based and static assignment model is the most conventional and well-explored. The integration between trip-based and dynamic assignment model is used for Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) in practice (the demand is stretched). Differently, the integration between activity-based and static assignment model is used for ABM in practice (User Equilibrium is stretched). Finally, the integration between the ABM and DTA is an advanced and promising contribution when dealing with road networks.====The integration between trip-based and static assignment model is the most studied, applied and explored, while the integration between the ABM and DTA is an advanced and promising contribution when dealing with road networks. Unfortunately, the joint use of ABM and DTA is very complex and computationally consuming and applications to large networks need to pay attention to private traffic only simplifying the other transport mode simulations (i.e., public transport) and their interactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a new formalization oriented to an easy-to-use and computationally faster application, which considers the integration of ABM with multimodal assignment by considering the interaction between different modes sharing the same network facilities as well as crowding (public transport) and congestion (road) phenomena.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the state-of-the art of the integration problem, which allows to focus the scope of this paper. Section 3 presents mathematical formalization.

This paper names this phenomenon “Large Elasticity at Introduction” (LEI). It has been observed in four of five cities with urban tolls: London, Singapore, Stockholm and Gothenburg. After describing these cities’ experiences, the paper discusses why LEI is surprising from a modeling perspective, and then discusses and formalizes three plausible explanations for LEI: (i) transaction costs; (ii) the “zero-price effect”; and (iii) the “price-sensitive users” theory proposed by Börjesson and Kristoffersson (2018).","The Atlanta Streetcar—a 2.7 mile streetcar line with twelve stops—was free to ride during its first year of operation, 2015, until January 2016, when a $1 fare was imposed. Ostensibly in consequence, ridership fell by 58% between 2015 and 2016. Other transit systems have sometimes exhibited the converse effect: large ridership increases when they eliminate fares (Volinski, 2012), particularly for non-commute trips (Bull et al., 2020, Cools et al., 2016). These cases have inspired some transit advocates to argue for “fare-free” policies. Note there is no similar movement for, say, $0.50 fares even though that fare would, likewise, be cheaper than most fares in wealthy countries. The “fare-free” argument rests on the notion there is something qualitatively different about the move between ==== and ====.====This paper is concerned with the idea something similar applies to what Lehe (2019) calls “downtown congestion pricing”, the use of tolls on driving in central urban areas of major cities as a way to curb driving and its auxiliary hazards (e.g., pollution, accidents, etc.). Lehe (2019) identifies five cities that have implemented downtown congestion pricing as such: Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan and Gothenburg. In four of the five cities, the elasticity of traffic demand with respect to the change in money cost of a trip was of larger magnitude at introduction than for later increases. (The exception, Milan, has not changed toll levels since its “Area C” launched in 2012.) We call this phenomenon ==== (LEI).====This paper’s aim is to foster further discussion of LEI by providing examples and clarifying issues of causation and modeling. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the four examples where LEI has been observed. Section 3 clarifies formally what LEI entails and why it is surprising. Section 4 discusses and models three plausible explanations for LEI. Section 5 concludes with ideas for future research.====Before beginning, two pieces of housekeeping are in order. First, it can be awkward to speak of how price elasticity changes. A change in elasticity from −1 to −2 is, strictly speaking, a “fall” in elasticity, but demand has become ==== sensitive to price changes. Hence we use ==== language—where “size” means “magnitude”. The larger of two price elasticities is farther from zero, and elasticity grows when it falls. Second, LEI is a ==== label, not an explanation. To say “Demand fell so much when the toll came into force ==== LEI” is similar to “The mammoth died out because of extinction”. Relatedly, LEI is not the “zero-price effect” (discussed in Section 4). The zero-price effect, rather, is a possible cause of LEI.",Large Elasticity at Introduction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000883,25 August 2021,2021,Research Article,62.0

The impulse for the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) also in road transport, through the use of Green Hydrogen, electricity and bio-methane, represents a major chance to reduce the environmental impacts of the whole transport sector, to improve the security of energy supply, and to revive the economy. In the urban areas, where travelled distance is often short and regenerative breaking energy could be relevant, the use of battery electric vehicles seems a very promising option among all. In particular the road Public Transport would represent a “key” to introduce the electric power for automotive operation in urban areas. In fact, electrification of PT (Public Transport) can result even more simple than it would for private mobility, thanks to an easier organization of the recharge activities due to a well scheduled vehicles operation, and so several example of BEBs uses are emerging in many cities in the world.

In future years, traditional fossil-fuelled vehicles are estimated to be substituted with electric vehicles (EVs), resulting in higher electricity demand from the transport sector. Meanwhile, the electricity sector is transforming due to policies to adopt ==== such as solar, wind, and hydropower in the future. However, there are still societal concerns regarding the environmental benefits of these vehicle technologies and how new energy options and vehicles benefit the 2050 HK Carbon Neutral Plan. To address these concerns, this paper aims to analyse the environmental burdens of current (2019) and future (2050) vehicle scenarios in Hong Kong using a ","The warming impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is continuously increasing globally, and transportation is one of the significant drivers of GHG emissions. For example, the transportation sector accounts for 19.5% of the European Union's GHG emissions (European Environment Agency, 2014). In Hong Kong, around 18.1% of all GHG emissions in 2018 were produced by the transportation sector (ClimateReady@HK, 2020). The transportation sector mainly use fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas that discharge significant amounts of GHGs and generate formidable climate change (Fan et al., 2018; Timilsina & Shrestha, 2009). The adverse consequences of environmental degradation are becoming more dominantly apparent in the shape of ambient air pollutants. Thus, continuing efforts are required to mitigate environmental impacts and reduce transportation's dependence on conventional fuels.====Currently, electromobility is a suitable option that generates lower air pollutant emissions than conventional vehicles in the transportation sector (Burchart-Korol et al., 2018; Elgowainy et al., 2018; Ellingsen et al., 2017; Hawkins et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Nordelöf et al., 2019; Wu et al, 2018, 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained greater consideration for adoption due to their sustainable qualities, as they can reduce CO==== emissions more than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are the prevalent EVs, and more than one million BEVs had been sold worldwide in 2018 (EV-Volumes, 2019). With its swift economic growth, Hong Kong's total energy consumption amplified each year from 2000 to 2015, which also put numerous pressures on the energy supply system. In addition, the number of registered passenger vehicles increased from 465,894 in 2010 to 645,584 in 2019, accounting for a 27.9% increase (Transport Department, 2020a). The conventional vehicle, which mainly refers to a conventional petrol vehicle, is one of the primary sources of pollutant emissions, which discharged a large amount of CO==== and NO==== in Hong Kong in 2017 (Environment Bureau, 2017). Considerable financial strategies and the advancement of battery technologies have positively sped up the growth of EVs. In Hong Kong, in 2010–2019, more than 90% of the passenger vehicles were petrol-driven (Transport Department, 2020b); diesel vehicles represented around 5% of the fleet (Fig. 1). The number of EVs began increasing rapidly after 2015, and the increase is expected to continue, as the Hong Kong government is providing incentives to the public for the adoption of EVs in the future (Environment Protection Department of Hong Kong, 2020). Hong Kong has also taken some initiatives to boost the EV industry, such as the first registration tax concession for EVs and 100% profit tax deduction for EVs in the first year of registration in Hong Kong (Environment Protection Department of Hong Kong, 2020).====From the environmental perspective, electromobility would benefit from reducing air pollution and noise. The incorporation of EVs into the city transportation system is necessary to promote sustainable development in the Hong Kong transport sector (Environment Bureau, 2017). Another primary concern about road transportation is air pollution such as NOx, SO====, CO, ozone, volatile organic compounds, toxic heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury), organic pollutants (e.g., dioxins), and particulate matter. Air pollution has an adverse effect on human health and affects various parts of the human body (Kampa & Castanas, 2008). Transportation noise is also a serious issue that causes health problems. As EVs do not have a combustion engine, they do not discharge direct CO==== emissions and air pollutions into the natural atmosphere. Although EVs provide momentous benefits in terms of reduction of fossil energy consumption as well as pollutant emissions, it is unclear whether they have potential in the life cycle (while considering material production, vehicle manufacture, and recycling processes) (Bauer et al., 2015; Faria et al., 2013; Ke et al., 2017; Rosenfeld et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2016). Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been introduced to assess the energy and environmental impact of various vehicles. For example, Hawkins et al. (2013) performed an LCA study on EVs and conventional vehicles; the results showed that EVs can decrease GHG emissions by up to 29%. Moreover, Faria et al. (2013) performed an LCA study of an EV in various geographical locations (France, Portugal, and Poland), and the results manifested that the highest air pollution by the EV was found in Poland, as a major portion of Polish electricity is generated from coal. On the other hand, France had the lowest emissions because a significant portion of French electricity is produced from nuclear plants.====Multiple studies have been performed on the evaluation of LCA of EVs and ICEVs in different geographical locations: Brazil (de Souza et al., 2018), China (Qiao et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2019), Lithuania (Petrauskienė et al., 2020), Poland (Burchart-Korol et al., 2018), Czech Republic (Burchart-Korol et al., 2018), Canada (Bicer & Dincer, 2018), Japan (Kosai et al., 2018), Sweden (Nordelöf et al., 2014, Nordelöf et al., 2019), Switzerland (Bauer et al., 2015; Yazdanie et al., 2014), and the United States (Onat et al., 2018). Recent researchers have shown that the environmental performance of battery EVs is strongly dependent on the size of the battery, the energy used for the battery recharging and production phase, and how the energy is produced (Cox et al., 2018; Ellingsen et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2017).====To provide a comprehensive LCA calculation of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), the future energy mix, and a comprehensive life cycle inventory database, there is a need for an LCA evaluation that considers all these aspects. In addition, there remains a major gap in the literature, as all previous studies (Bauer et al., 2015; Burchart-Korol et al., 2018; Petrauskienė et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021) have focused on the environmental impact assessment of BEV and missed the impact of the energy transition considering all different types of vehicles (such as BEV, PHEV) with diesel and petrol. Thus, future development in the electricity sector must be incorporated into the life cycle database to assess future EVs' environmental impacts accurately. Beltran et al. (2020) showed that the environmental performance of EVs and ICEVs changes strongly in the future energy scenarios, and the relative performance of two powertrains differs significantly based on the chosen scenario. Similarly, Cox et al. (2018) also showed that the future energy sector must be included in LCA to evaluate EVs’ environmental impacts comprehensively. However, Cox et al. (2018) only included the future energy mix scenarios for BEV. Only a few studies (Burchart-Korol et al., 2018; Messagie et al., 2014) included the uncertainty analysis of the vehicle performance parameters independently. However, presently, there is a literature gap regarding how the future energy mix could have an impact on the overall LCA performance of EV and PHEV using the HK energy mix. To fill this research gap, the following research questions are answered: a) Do EVs and PHEVs mitigate the impact of climate change compared with conventional vehicles in future energy scenarios or only in the scenario where electricity sector decarbonisation is achieved? b) Which environmental benefits could be achieved with vehicle electrification compared with ICEVs by utilising the HK future energy mix scenarios?====The present study tries to fill the above research gaps using LCA evaluation of ICEVs, EVs, and PHEVs, taking Hong Kong as a case study. The main objective of the paper is to undertake a comprehensive analysis that can provide comprehensive answers to the questions above. To achieve this, this analysis a) examines the production and use phase environmental impact of different powertrains and their relative performance assessment based on complete LCA results, b) provides consistent life cycle environmental impacts of current (2019) and future (2050) passenger vehicles (EV and PHEV) based on future energy mix scenarios, and c) helps engineers identify green opportunities in the future transport system and helps policy-makers optimise the portfolio of HK energy development.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.

Risks in SC affect a wide range of stakeholders. Strategy risks are associated with disturbances for achieving business goals while operational risks are related to disturbances in the execution of an organization's day-to-day activity (====; ====). Financial risks are concerned with insufficient cash flow to run their business and the inability to meet financial commitments. And, disruption risks are related to low-frequency-high-impact occurrences such as natural disasters and man-made devastation (====). Disruption risks have a very fast and strong impact on supply chain activities and also influence supply chain sustainability (====; ====). Now, the researchers should focus on how to bring sustainability to the SC activity, and while simultaneously tackling the disruption risk (====).====In the last two decades, the world has witnessed numerous natural disasters and every disaster has caused a direct and indirect impact on sustainability (====; ====; ====). According to ====, ==== and ====, a combination of HSC and sustainable development is known as a sustainable humanitarian supply chain (SHSC). SHSC provides a great contribution to rehabilitation, local development, saving lives, and overcoming the economic crisis. But, the prediction of disaster, forecasting of emergency items and relief materials, coordination among the SC players, and uncertainty in terms of demand and supplies are some of the big challenges of the HSC. The pandemic outbreak is a specific case of SC risk and disruption==== which is characterized by long-term disaster impact, very fast disperse, unpredictable scaling, and vast pandemic spread (====). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) is the latest example of a pandemic outbreak. COVID-19 that started from Wuhan in China in November 2019, within a short period, spread all over the world.

Therefore, it gives motivation to sustainability researchers and practitioners that they should come up with solutions to address the SCD and try to bring sustainability to the supply chain during the pandemic outbreak.====For a better understanding of the objective of this paper, the research questions considered in this study are as follows:====RQ1. What are the CSFs for the sustainable initiative in the SC during and immediately after the pandemic outbreak?====RQ2. What are the views and requirements of stakeholders?====RQ3. What is the relationship between stakeholders’ requirements and CSFs?====RQ4. What are the hierarchical levels among these CSFs?====). The traditional QFD cannot prioritize the requirements; consequently, we integrated it with the best-worst method for better prioritizing the process of requirements (====). Since the requirements of the stakeholders’ are always conflicting, vague, and inconsistent in nature, the integrated BWM-QFD framework is utilized. The BWM reduces biases from subjective decision-making and ranks the CSFs (====). The methodology is suitable apt for the present study for the following reasons: 1) the weighted importance of the stakeholder requirements are simultaneously considered in the decision-making process; 2) the requirements of the stakeholders are incorporated as BWM weights in the evaluation process; 3) BWM weights of the critical success factors obtained based on their previous experience are also included in the decision-making process and 4) QFD is finally used for incorporating all the above requirements and based on the stakeholder requirements; critical success factors are evaluated and ranked.

The ==== focuses on reducing the commuting trips to the city centre, aggregating as much as possible the origins-destinations and the timetables, by using a taxi sharing service. A questionnaire including a stated-preference experiment has been developed and delivered to a random sample of 90 people. Discrete choice models are developed within a methodological framework and VOT has been estimated through the estimated coefficients. For the estimation of WTP, the Price Sensitivity Model is used based on two samples consisted of the pilot service's users at the beginning and at the end of the pilot period.

In order the total societal benefit to be more easily perceived, the transformation of the gain of each of these measures into a single unit, which is usually a monetary currency, is required (Antoniou et al., 2007). Thus, travel time can be converted to monetary amounts through the concept of VOT.====Despite of the difficulties in the quantification of VOT and WTP measures, their critical role in the transportation planning and infrastructure management lead to several efforts for their indirect assessment. The heterogeneity of the travelers' populations due to thedifferent socioeconomic characteristics, trip purpose and other attributes results in a variety of VOTs across individuals depending on the methodology used. Thus, affluent travellers may prefer to pay a steep toll than choosing a longer route without tolls, while students may prefer the second option (Björklund & Swä). The most common approach to compute VOT and WTP measures is the use of the estimated coefficients for the cost and the duration of the travel through discrete choice models based on surveys’ data (Diamandis et al., 1997).

The customer demand for high quality and fast service has increased the pressure that did not exist before; hence, companies can no longer handle the whole work alone. In the competitive market, enterprises and production companies need to handle organizations and internal resources and manage and oversee relevant extra-organizational resources and bodies to attain competitive gains to increase a more significant market share. Accordingly, actions (e.g., supply and demand planning, material providing, production and product planning, goods storing service, inventory control, distribution, delivery, and customer service, all of which were previously performed in companies) are now assigned Supply Chains (SCs).====Emerging SC challenges have put pressure on the medical and health organizations to provide an opportunity to improve the efficiency of processes and reduce costs and improve the quality of provided services for patients. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is more complex than other industries because the patient's health needs careful and adequate medical essentials. Because perishable goods (e.g., dairy products, vegetables, medicine, blood, and chemicals) lose their values over time.====Roles of drugs are increasing in health systems day by day, and SCM is a part of the health system, and thus the concept of health will not be significantly grown in society if the concept is not adequately taken into account. The SC needs an efficient organization to deliver drugs to patients at the right time and place. It consists of four main components: raw materials supply, drug production, drug distribution, and drug sale. The coordinated management and control of all the above activities are critical issues in an SC loosely speaking, drug SCM needs to be efficiently organized so that patients receive their necessary medicine at the right time and place. SCM is a phenomenon under which customers can receive reliable and fast service and high-quality products at minimal costs.====As a whole, the SC contains two or more administrations that are officially divided from each other; however, they are associated with each other by information, financial flows, and material flows. These administrations can be organizations that yield raw materials, parts, and final products or provide wholesale, distribution, storage, and retail services. Even the final consumer can be considered as one of these administrations.====Companies must focus on their capabilities and critical resources to gain a competitive advantage and promote their market positions in the current competitive era. The competitiveness of production companies relies on the development of their competencies. Meanwhile, SCM is considered a powerful tool for promoting corporate growth and creating a competitive advantage. An SCM operation plays a critical role in managerial decisions as far as it can have significant effects on corporate profitability and operational success (Ghafarimoghadam et al., 2019; Karimi & Davoudpour, 2017; Noroozi et al., 2018).====The council of SCM professionals demarcated the SCM concept as follows: 'SCM includes the management and planning of all activities included in procurement, logistics management such as sourcing, conversion, etc. Significantly, it also consists of coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which involve suppliers, intermediaries, third-party service providers, and customers. In essence, SCM incorporates demand management and supply inside or outside of companies.'====In this study, we investigate a novel tri-objective mathematical model of the PSC to meet the obligations that emerged about pharmaceutical SCM in recent years.

Traffic congestion, higher maintenance and fuel prices, delays, accidents, and air emissions stem from the general rise in flow volume. Because of the NP-hard nature of this problem, a hidden Markov model and an Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) are employed in this paper to solve it. Each particle (solution) behaves as a search agent in EO, with its position. To reach the equilibrium condition, the search agents change their focus at random regarding the best-so-far approaches, including equilibrium candidates. A well-defined ""generation rate"" concept has been shown to elevate EO's capacity in avoiding local minima. This article provides a new method to lower the feasible ==== and the public travel cost using the hidden Markov model and EO algorithm. The suggested method's performance was compared to the performance of other algorithms on a test network. The related numerical outcomes show that it is more effective.","At present, the demand for public transport has increased rapidly around the world (Sumpavakup, Suwannakijborihan, Ratniyomchai, & Kulworawanichpong, 2018). Works are superimposed on physical networks of highways, parking systems, and trains in public transportation networks (Liu, Chen, Liu, Jermsittiparsert, & Ghadimi, 2020). Public transportation networks are relatively complex schemes due to the significance of transfers, multimodality, transit hubs, and intermediate walking ties; however, in contrast to the personal car option, connectivity is usually weak, and service quality varies over time (Kim, Jeong, Kim, & Park, 2020). Besides, workers (e.g., drivers), electric power (Hosseini Firouz & Ghadimi, 2016), telecom, vehicles, and other factors all play a role in the performance of operations. Many of these aspects add up to public transportation being less mobile and potentially less robust than driving one's vehicle. Besides, public transportation networks' multimodality can allow alternate modes to have backup power in the event of failures to decrease the whole risk (Bagal et al., 2018; Basnak et al., 2020). In the event of a disturbance, there are also more resources for organized reconstruction and mitigation activities (Cats and Jenelius, 2015). In today's public transit setting, the ever-increasing number of electric vehicles poses a threat (Lu et al., 2020). There are ==== potential networks for a road network with ==== junctions. As a consequence, discovering an optimum path is a vital criterion of traffic optimization. However, in many situations, there is a restriction or unavailability of a road intersection. It is often likely that a specific link that seems to be shorter is inaccessible or heavily disputed at a certain time. Another profitable way of dealing with it is to reduce the time spent waiting at traffic signals. It saves drivers valuable time and alleviates traffic, increases public safety, and facilitates the flow of health demands (Srivastava & Sahana, 2019). Congestion has been a major impediment to economic prosperity as well as a hazard to life quality. In several cities, traffic congestion reduction proposals have been met with cynicism. The Network Design Problem (NDP) entails making the best decision to improve transportation infrastructure in response to rising travel needs while taking network users' route preference behavior into account (Xu, Yang, & Gao, 2010, pp. 513–517).====In the process of real-time regulation, multiple-objective optimization (regular interval time, transit time, route time, quality of service, etc.) is simultaneously known as the NP-hard multi-objective optimization problem that cannot be solved by traditional methods (Sidi, Hammadi, Hayat, & Borne, 2008). Since this problem aims to achieve the minimum cost (total commute time) and the maximum of feasible public travels per unit length of the NP-hard problems, it requires a nonlinear algorithm. In the present article, the public transport network design is proposed using the Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) and hidden Markov model. This algorithm makes use of an exploratory search mechanism and the Gaussian mutation based on the reconstruction and division of the population. The population is developed in each iteration of the suggested algorithm utilizing these structures and the EO's regular search protocol. These methods aim to preserve various solutions throughout the search to prevent stagnation against suboptimal solutions and increase the convergence rate to achieve more precise optimum solutions (Gupta, Deep, & Mirjalili, 2020).====This article also uses the Markov model. A Markov model is a statistic that assumes the modeled structure is a Markov procedure with hidden (unseen) states (Zhu et al., 2020). The most straightforward dynamic Bayes' network is the hidden Markov model (Heidari Gharehbolagh et al., 2017; Sidi, Hammadi, Hayat, & Borne, 2008). The objectives of this paper are as follows:====The residual sections of the article are as follows. In Section 2, some of the important approaches to public transportation networks are discussed. Section 3 prepares a complete overview of the proposed method and details of implementing the suggested method with the outcomes. Experiments, simulations, data sets, and graphs are illustrated in Section 4.

Taxi drivers face two options after dropping off passengers: waiting to pick up passengers at the airport or ditching the airport and searching elsewhere for their next trips. Understanding how taxi drivers make decisions will not only benefit themselves but also benefit passengers. In addition, policies can be made to balance the taxi supply and demand at airports. In this research, a ==== model was developed to investigate taxi drivers' decision-making mechanism based on queueing theory. By comparing the net income of these two options in the same time period, a better strategy could be selected. The model was then validated by a case study conducted at Yaoqiang International Airport in Jinan, China. With the model established, drivers' decisions in different time periods could be determined. By analyzing the model results, it was found that the results obtained by the model were consistent with the real-world situations. Furthermore, it was also discovered that taxi drivers’ decisions were strongly influenced by the number of flights taking off and landing in a certain period.","Taxi service is an important component of ground transportation at airports. One study shows taxis serve 11% to 47% of passenger volume at large airports (Arkadiusz Kołoś et al., 2012). Nowadays, more and more people choose to take a taxi after they arrive at the airports because of its convenience, speediness, door-to-door attribute, privacy, comfort, long-time operation, and lack of parking fees (Chang & Chu, 2009). The efficiency of taxi operations is critical in determining the overall level of service of ground transportation systems at the airport (Ji et al., 2017). However, the taxi supply and demand at airports are not always balanced. The unbalance causes waste of time, roadway congestion, and air pollution. Since taxi drivers’ decisions greatly affect the taxi supply at airports, understanding the decision-making mechanism is important to address this problem, improving the quality of taxi service at the airport and increasing the income of taxi drivers.====Taxi drivers face two options after they drop passengers at the airport, which are: A) go to the waiting area to pick up passengers then go back to the city. B) go back to the city directly without picking up any passenger. If they choose option A, taxi drivers need to wait at the designated area, then pick up passengers on a “first-come-first-serve” basis. The waiting time depends on both the number of waiting taxis and the number of arriving passengers. For option B, taxi drivers need to pay no-load fees themselves and may lose potential income.====Usually, drivers make their decisions based on personal experience, such as the number of flights arriving in a certain season and time period, and the number of possible passengers. The number of taxis already in the waiting area is another information that drivers can observe. On the other hand, for passengers to take taxis after getting off the plane, they have to queue up at the designated boarding area and board the taxis in order. The airport taxi management staff is responsible for releasing taxis from the waiting area into the boarding area and arrange a certain number of passengers to board.====In practice, taxi drivers' decisions are influenced by various factors. This paper aims to: 1) develop a model to investigate taxi drivers’ decision-making strategy, considering the change of the number of passengers at the airport during different time periods and the net income of taxi drivers, and 2) validate the developed model with data collected at Yaoqiang International Airport in Jinan, China.====To achieve the first goal, a ==== queuing system model was developed to investigate the two options taxi drivers faced, and an income function model for decision-making was established. In order to ensure the feasibility of comparison, the net income in the same time period is selected for analysis. By comparing the net incomes of the two options, the driver will choose the one with the higher revenue.====To achieve the second goal, flight information was collected at Yaoqiang International Airport. Taxi drivers' decisions can be determined using the decision-making model aforementioned. By analyzing the simulated results based on real-world situations, the model's rationality can be justified.====The outline of this paper is as follows. First, previous research on modeling taxi drivers’ customer searching and decision-making will be reviewed and summarized. Next, the proposed model is presented. To validate the developed model, a simulation is then performed, and the results are discussed.

In the 1980's and 1990's, one has witnessed a substantial shift of production activities. Increasing production activities led to increasing wage levels and land rents in developing countries since. COVID-19 may be a trigger that will re-inforce the nearshoring process. This paper develops and applies a framework with a quantitative and a qualitative part, so as to verify how a selected nearshoring candidate country performs. The quantitative part relies on a chain cost calculation model, while the qualitative part uses appreciations given by the ==== to ‘time’, ‘value’ and ‘cost’. The framework is applied to a case with production located in China. In doing so, it is important to determine which sector one belongs to, since different characteristics will play a different role depending on the sector. Furthermore, transport costs typically do not have the biggest share in total supply costs, but may be decisive as they determine also the lead time and hence the costs related to stocks. Finally, it turns out that qualitative decision factors – rather linked to perception and personal preferences – do not always match economic outcomes.","In the 1980's and 1990's, one has witnessed a substantial shift of production activities. In a first move, the shift was away from the company to another company in its relative neighbourhood. That shift was then called ‘outsourcing’. In a further step, the shift was away from developed countries to developing ones, called ‘offshoring’. First companies to step in were American. European companies were rather reluctant at first, until they saw the benefits that outsourcing brought to their US competitors. At first also, mainly low-quality production was outsourced. Later on, companies discovered that the target countries also amply hosted more experienced and better-qualified workers. As an illustration, Appendix A presents a SWOT==== for China as an offshoring production location.====It is true that still in 2020, the developed countries remain the biggest markets in terms of purchasing power.==== However, thanks among others to the production activities that have been delocated towards developing countries, some of them, like China for instance, have seen their share in global welfare strongly increase. The chain reaction initiated by the delocation continued though: increasing production activities and welfare led to increasing wage levels and land rents in developing countries. This in turn more recently led production companies to start considering for their manufacturing activities a move back towards the developed countries many of them once had left. The concept of nearshoring was born.==== There was also a market need for that reverse move: reaction speed to comply with ever-increasing complexity of consumer requests, including e-commerce. Customers more and more want their ordered products to be tailor-made and delivered quickly (====; ====). Furthermore, here was also a big push to minimize inventory (not least because styles and models demanded change so quickly) which is easier when producers are located close to consumers. Finally, President Trump's trade barrier policies and China's ‘eye-for-an-eye’ responses have done much to promote near/on-shoring.====So, COVID-19 was not the real cause of the louder talk that in 2020 started in ==== globally on nearshoring. In the past decade, there was already a slow but gradual shift toward intra-continental trade instead of cross-continental trade. At best, COVID-19 is a trigger that will re-inforce this process. Companies that are not yet applying a real nearshoring strategy, are at least considering it.====There is however one element that with a crisis with the global magnitude of COVID-19 comes to the fore strongly and adds to all the above motives in favor of nearshoring: ==== and production control. Given the strong dependence on overseas areas for the production of a large number of products, also ‘essential’ ones (food, medicine, protective wear, replacement components for essential equipment, etc.), many current supply chain setups have proven to be very vulnerable. First, as the COVID epidemic started in China, and most of its factories had to close down for at least two months, the source of production obviously dried up. Add to that the closure of most port activities in China for at least a while, which implied that neither finished products that were still on stock in China for sales, nor raw materials needed for production that was still open, could leave respectively enter the country. Obviously, this created serious disruptions in product inflows in most other markets in the world.====Because of not being able to enter Chinese ports, or at least because of not having cargo to transport from there, which of course is the payload that the shipping companies live from, many shipping companies decided to reduce the number of calls or even (temporarily) abandoned certain loops. They did that in an effort not to burn scarce capital in sailings that did not pay (enough). This obviously further blocked the production activities that were still going on in China and prevented them from easily exporting.====Then came a next phase of COVID-19, with its spread around the planet, it becoming a real pandemic. That meant that also the target markets for Chinese and other exports started to get seriously affected, with a similar pattern as in China: company closures, meaning that local production activities requesting inputs from overseas, stalled; shop closures, so that also demand for many products dropped; only essential activities remaining open, with in particular medical services, where demand started booming to the extreme. Most ports kept running more or less as usual, but became stock areas for containers with intermediate and finished products that started coming again from China, where activities had gradually and slowly picked up again. Chinese manufacturers made every effort to ramp up production so as not to break supply chains, but the break now happened on the receiving side. Production nor demand for non-essential products was present locally. At the same time, local demand for essential products like medicine was overly present, but due to global scarcity, and big needs for these products in China itself, their supply stalled.====Hence, it is clear that current international supply chain settings are extremely vulnerable, and therefore prone to high uncertainty, both from the demand and supply side. COVID-19 was also not the first, but most certainly the largest, test for the globalized production and supply system, since neither the 2008 financial-economic crisis, nor SARS, nor others had impacts of a similar magnitude. Its global occurrence, and especially the duration over which it may show impacts, will undoubtedly mean a strategic rethinking of parts of or entire supply chains. Nearshoring will be an essential element of that.====Another remarkable impact of COVID-19 is that it directly led, for the first time in decades, to shipping companies laying-up capacity, thereby leading to strong increases in shipping rates. In the past, without this external trigger, and purely depending on voluntary co-operation among the shipping companies that never materialized due to lack of trust and ==== applying, such rate increase has always proven impossible. The rate increase also brings the freight rates closer to the true social costs of shipping, thereby contributing also to mitigating environmental problems that were waiting for a solution for decades: making users aware of the true cost of shipping. And of course, this again re-inforces the revival of nearshoring.====Typical nearshoring candidate countries for the US are Mexico, Brazil and other Central- and South-American countries. For Europe, Central- and Eastern-European countries qualify. The question then is which will be the exact new location: will it be the original ‘mother’ country, or some neighbouring country with similar characteristics, or which is at least geographically closer to the developed countries market. Developed countries surely have a number of assets in that respect, since next to a large market, they typically also offer well-established logistics systems and infrastructures. Witness the scores many of them obtain in for instance the Logistics Performance Index by the World Bank.====There is however not so much scientific insight into which are the factors that typically play in such nearshoring decision. At best, one gets survey-based views on what factors are at play (====). Even less, there are instruments that allow quantifying the costs and benefits of different nearshoring locations. If available, these often focus on one or a limited objective, for instance wage costs (====; ====) or customer relationship (====The paper is structured as follows.

Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a user-oriented transportation solution that integrates both public and private operators into the same platform. The implementation of MaaS aims to simplify users’ booking procedures and increase the usability of various kinds of transportation resources. However, the integration of a myriad of transportation subsystems raises interpretation challenges from associated multi-stakeholder and subsystems. To overcome these challenges, the authors have involved different stakeholders from related subsystems to reveal concerns. This study aims to analyse a novel public transportation system - the self-driving mini-bus service in Shenzhen. The result shows that system characteristics and stakeholder concerns can be established using an Action, Factor and Goal structure. Stakeholders involved described their perceptions of self-driving bus integration in MaaS. The description could be used by analysts to uncover integration gaps further and could be updated by involving more stakeholders according to project developments. This study highlights the complexity of self-driving mini-buses integration challenges in MaaS from a stakeholder perspective, which provides learnings to advance the MaaS adoption in the future.","Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a comprehensive service package for fulfilling travellers' needs by both public and private mobility operators through a unified platform (Hensher, 2017; Viswanath & Mathew, 2014). MaaS is the evolution of ‘as a service’==== transportation solutions, which are expected to bring a wide range of social and economic benefits through personalised mobility (Datson, 2016). Since 2014, the idea of MaaS has received much attention from companies and authorities in providing integrated mobility services (Frank, 2018). Several ongoing projects in EU are furthering the MaaS concept and the self-driving bus service separately (KPMG, 2017; Smith, Sochor, & Karlsson, 2018 a; Smith, Sochor, & Sarasini, 2018 b). For example, the MaaS Global company has already launched the Whim app for MaaS in Finland, and the UK with different transportation services (public transportation, taxi, car, bike) integrated (MaaS Global – Mobility as a Service, 2018). Although there are examples of MaaS, there are still challenges caused by complex engineering disciplines and organisations involved. Changes in transportation systems can enable social transformation such as a sharing economy, environmental awareness, and personalised consumption trends (Milakis, Van Arem, & Van Wee, 2017). For example, with the development of vehicle and infrastructure technology, the Kutsuplus project could be tested on the demand-responsive bus service (Honabach & Sargent, 2016). Whereas the efficiency of transportation resources and usage are essential drivers for ITS and MaaS development, few studies have examined the extent to which these developments are aligned with the needs and wishes of stakeholders (Nikitas, Kougias, Alyavina, & Njoya Tchouamou, 2017).====System-level assessments call for a new integration of methods for structuring stakeholder perspectives that have rarely been applied to the ITS and MaaS domain. Some studies focus on the technology acceptance analysis of ITS or MaaS separately. In Sweden, system thinking methods are being applied to the stakeholder perspective to analyse how MaaS and autonomous transportation systems can create value for an urban system (Karlsson, Sochor, & Strömberg, 2016). A systematic analysis from the actor perspective is necessary in order to illustrate the complexity and solve potential conflicts (Nguyen, Mohamed, & Panuwatwanich, 2018), (Christiaanse, 2019, pp. 83–92). In the public sector, the complexity of decision making has increased because the control process relies more on multiple actors than on single actors (Dewulf, 2007). To understand gaps from different stakeholders and subsystems, the authors conducted actor analysis to learn the opportunity for small self-driving bus service integration in a MaaS solution. Actor analysis methods can capture an actor's views of a policy problem to help analysts and decision-makers to understand the mechanisms behind complex situations (Bijlsma, Bots, Wolters, & Hoekstra, 2011; Hermans & Cunningham, 2013) to make better decisions. The actor analysis method was also implemented in a complex technology innovation case using the electric road system as the case study to reveal different stakeholders' perceptions and challenges at the early stage (Wang, Hauge, & Meijer, 2019; Wang, Hauge, & Meijer, 2019). The emergence of ITS solutions and the intention to integrate MaaS also involved multi-systems and stakeholders, in which the actor analysis method is needed to sort out the complexity uncover more insights from different stakeholder perspectives.====This paper addresses the following question: What challenges influence the self-driving mini-bus system integration in MaaS using the actor analysis approach to revealing the stakeholders' concerns? To answer these questions, the authors first summarised the characteristics of the MaaS and ITS self-driving bus system from the current literature and projects and then revised these characteristics with experts in order to compile Action, Factor and Goal (AFG) list Va, Vb1 and Vb to describe stakeholder perceptions. This study builds on the China Bus System of the Future (CBFS) project in Shenzhen. The development of a new generation urban bus system involved a combination of new vehicle technologies and infrastructures. The gaps for self-driving mini-bus systems integration in MaaS are analysed combined with stakeholder's perspective. This study also discusses the potential future directions and the acceptance of the combination of a self-driving mini-bus system and the MaaS service.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the methodology and related research work in MaaS and ITS self-driving mini-buses cases.

More specific, the VISSIM microscopic simulation software along with VisVAP and EnViVer add-on modules were employed to represent the operation of a bus lane with intermittent use by cars in a highly congested arterial. We modelled various scenarios to determine the level of traffic volumes and bus service frequencies for which such bus lane concept would be effective. Empirical findings showed that when peak hour volumes range between 1000 and 2000 vehicles, the mixing of cars and buses on bus lanes may lead to a) serious reductions of vehicles’ queue lengths, b) significant decreases of greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions derived from traffic flow and speed profile improvements and c) financial viability of the experiment. The joint use of bus lanes at 2000 vehicles per peak hour was highlighted as the most financially viable scenario. On the other hand, delays were comparatively increased due to the lower speed of cars which were moving onto the bus lane. Finally, our bus lane concept was not performed well under bus headways shorter than 2 min.","Bus lanes is a well-established bus priority measure with numerous applications globally (Ben-Dor et al., 2018; Hensher, 2007; Kim, 2003; Lindau et al., 2014). As any other mobility management measure, though, their installation should be carefully studied so as not to put at risk all other coexistent motorized transport modes, which due to a potential loss of roadway capacity may experience a deterioration of traffic conditions and congestion or bottleneck problems. Intermittent lanes provide for an interesting compromise (Viegas & Lu, 2001; 2004; Eichler & Daganzo, 2006). Intermittent, or moving, lanes rely on technology and enforcement to become exclusive bus lanes when a bus arrives (i.e. only for a relatively short period) and revert back to general-purpose operation once a bus has passed (The Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP), 2013).====The objective of this paper is to examine whether in periods of peak traffic volumes the intermittent use of bus lanes by cars can produce traffic flow and environmental benefits and thus decrease congestion. Focus is also being given to the exploration of the potential that intermittent bus lanes can have, in terms of financial viability. To investigate our hypothesis, we explored the case of a current bus lane segment in an arterial road of Thessaloniki, Greece. Thessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece and has approximately one million residents. High congestion, delays and vehicle queues often appear in city's poorly resourced road network along with associated environmental problems (Politis et al., 2010). Bus is the only public transport mode so far and the network of bus lanes is relatively short and concentrated to the city center (Georgiadis et al., 2014). In order to meet our study's objective, we employed the PTV VISSIM microsimulation software along with VisVap and EnViVer add-on modules, so as to appropriately model the operation of bus lane in the study site and highlight the traffic conditions under which such bus lane's intermittent function could reduce vehicle queues, delays and environmental impacts.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The following section reviews the bus lanes’ concepts which have been proposed so far along with the required technologies for their implementation. Section 3 describes the study area characteristics. Section 4 explains the concept of the bus lane model that we applied as well as its simulation process in VISSIM software.

Carsharing (CS) reduces the number of cars on the road, relieving congestion and transportation costs (Baptista et al., 2014; Benjaafar et al., 2015). It provides convenient mobility solutions, while lowering energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (Correia and Viegas, 2011; Shaheen and Cohen, 2018; Shaheen et al., 2018). Several studies prove the effectiveness of CS in reducing car ownership and vehicle kilometers driven (Cervero et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2010; Nijland and van Meerkerk, 2017; Severis, 2019; Sioui et al., 2013; Zhou and Kockelman, 2011). According to the empirical evidence reported by Bondorová and Archer (2017), Kent (2014), Santos (2018) and Shaheen et al. (2019), CS encourages a behavioral shift towards multi-modal sustainable transport, complementing public and active forms of transport, such as cycling and walking. It is also demonstrated that CS helps meeting the mobility demand of urban residents in marginalized neighborhoods (Abraham, 1999; Dill et al., 2017; Kim, 2015) and improves social inclusion and accessibility (Clark and Curl, 2016). However, CS is difficult to scale geographically in less-densely populated areas because the utilization rate is not high enough to offset the operators’ costs of purchasing, leasing and maintaining the vehicles, representing 70% of the total costs (Ballús-Armet et al., 2014; Hampshire and Gaites, 2011). To be financially sustainable, CS requires a minimum utilization rate of 40%, meaning that a car has to be rented for more than 9 h a day, a goal achievable only in urban areas with high residential density and using reservation control policies (Hampshire and Srinath, 2011).====Peer-to-peer carsharing (P2PCS) differs from business-to-consumer carsharing (B2CCS) since fleets are made only of privately owned cars. Car owners and renters are peers and share the vehicles through a platform via which it is possible to book the car, post the characteristics of the car, of the car's owner and of the renter, and pay the rental rate. The platform has two main functions, i.e. matching the demand and the supply of the market and providing an all risks insurance that guarantees both car owners and renters in case of accidents. The insurance automatically starts from the moment the user starts driving the car to the moment s/he returns it to the owner (Münzel et al., 2020). The platform operator charges car owners and renters 30% and 5% of the rental rate, respectively, and uses the revenues to cover network operations and insurance costs. P2PCS is more scalable to less dense cities and suburban areas than B2CCS because start-up and operating costs are negligible and is less capital intensive. Indeed, observing the spatial differences in the growth of P2PCS in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, France, Germany, and Belgium, van der Linden (2016) found that population density did not significantly influence the number of shared cars, supporting the hypothesis that P2PCS might be a more feasible alternative to B2CCS in less densely populated places.====In Italy, P2PCS is offered via two platforms, i.e. Auting, started in April 2017 with more than five thousand users and almost one thousand cars, and Genial Move, started in November 2018. Car owners need to be at least 21 years old and to possess their own car insurance, while renters are required to have held a full driving license for at least three years. Both platforms advise car owners on the rental rates to charge, but they are free to choose different values and to accept or reject the rental offers made by renters. In Italy, only daily rentals are currently available, although in other European countries platforms such as Getaround, the largest P2PCS operator serving five million members in the United States and in Europe, offer the service also by the hour. Although in Italy this form of car sharing is a relatively new business with 17,000 members, 1600 cars and 4150 rents,==== it is growing rapidly, especially in metropolitan cities such as Milan, Turin, Bologna and Rome. Users are generally young, aged between 20 and 35 years, and are used to travelling using shared mobility services.====According to Shaheen et al. (2012) and Shaheen and Cohen (2013), many factors restrain the adoption of P2PCS including: insurance costs and availability, challenges about balancing revenues and pricing, expense of technological solutions aimed at opening and closing the vehicles, car availability, and assurance of vehicle reliability. However, little is known about the attitudes, perceptions, and decision process through which individuals decide to offer and rent a car and there is no research to date on the latent beliefs and psychological barriers preventing P2PCS adoption in less-densely populated areas. Moreover, no study exists on the potential of P2PCS in Italy, except for Beria et al. (2017) and Mariotti et al. (2013) who focused, however, on Milan, the second largest (1.4 million residents) and most densely populated Italian city (7.589 inhabitants/km====) analyzing only the supply side of the market.====Our research differs from these studies with respect to the area analyzed, since we interviewed the residents of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, a northeastern Italian region characterized by small and medium-sized towns and rural areas, and with respect to the type of persons we interview, not only potential suppliers (car owners) but also potential renters. Moreover, we analyzed how latent beliefs and psychological barriers, besides price, sociodemographic characteristics and travel habits, drive the intention to join a P2PCS system. In the literature, only few studies have analyzed both sides of the market, but none of them performed an econometric analysis of the role played by latent variables in engaging in the P2PCS market. Additionally, on the basis of the results we have obtained, we have estimated the contribution that P2PCS could make to the decarbonization of the regional transport system, an analysis that was never done before for any Italian context. Finally, we provide novel insights into the role of policy makers in supporting P2PCS initiatives.",Peer-to-peer carsharing in less-densely populated areas: An empirical analysis in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000457,27 April 2021,2021,Research Article,75.0

Furthermore, transportation projects are regulated by the Clean Air Act towards the overall regional emission levels and project-level (or corridor-level) pollutant concentrations. The present study aimed to develop and implement an optimal integrated transportation and emissions modeling platform to evaluate regional vehicle emission and pollutant dispersion impacts and their significance for adding a managed lane facility to the roadway network. The case study examined the Loop 375–Border Highway West toll project in El Paso, Texas, under five proposed lane management strategies. Results confirmed the addition of a priced facility can provide congestion relief at the corridor level and cause some rerouting in other parts of the region. However, they do not appear to substantially reduce regional greenhouse gases and criteria pollutant emissions. The findings of the current study provide further insight within a regional context into selecting a transportation project and its true emission savings and air quality benefits.","Growing traffic congestion has motivated state and federal agencies to consider operational practices and policies for improving mobility in addition to expanding infrastructure, which may be spatially and economically difficult in many urban regions (Downs, 2004). Managed lanes (MLs) are an operational solution to relieve congestion and control traffic movement on freeways. MLs may control traffic flow by “restricting vehicle eligibility, limiting facility access, or and in some cases collecting variably priced tolls” (Perez, Fuhs, Gants, Giordano, & Ungemah, 2012). Therefore, three principal lane management policies can be considered by planning agencies: (a) a vehicle eligibility strategy that restricts certain vehicles on MLs based on either vehicle type (e.g., truck lane restriction) or vehicle occupancy (e.g., high-occupancy vehicle [HOV] lanes); (b) access control that limits and controls the entry and exit of vehicles on the ML facility (e.g., ramp metering); and (c) pricing, which is commonly used as an operational strategy, in which a fixed, varied, or dynamic pricing scheme is adopted (e.g., congestion pricing). Although each of these policies can be exclusively implemented on a freeway, several existing ML facilities take advantage of a combination of these operational strategies (e.g., high-occupancy toll [HOT] lanes) to achieve their objectives.====Well-planned MLs have the potential to reduce congestion, increase speed, and improve air quality (Perez et al., 2012). In addition to these gains, priced MLs are a source of revenue for operating agencies. Consequently, some transportation agencies choose to build priced MLs instead of general-purpose lanes to alleviate demand from congested parallel highways. The selection of a lane management policy for a brand-new facility depends on the project's scope, mobility improvement, and environmental impacts (Collier & Goodin, 2004). Priced MLs may improve air quality by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) and other criteria pollutants emitted in stop-and-go traffic conditions (Perez et al., 2012). The present study examined whether the use of an ML facility or implementation of different lane management policies can be considered part of the regional plan for mitigating GHG emissions and reducing the risk of climate change. Researchers investigated the amount of vehicle emission and pollutant dispersion reduction of an ML facility under a variety of priced lane management policies. Researchers utilized an integrated Transportation and Emissions Modeling Platform for Optimization (TEMPO) to estimate regional traffic, emissions, and pollutant dispersion of alternative lane management scenarios in a case study in El Paso, Texas. Specifically, researchers performed the following:====The main strength of the current study lies in the use of an automated pipeline of well-established modeling components for the full-chain assessment of traffic operations, emissions, and pollutant dispersion impacts on an entire region. There are major challenges in full-chain assessment studies, including disconnection between modeling components, intensive processing of resources, and resolution mismatch. However, TEMPO overcomes these challenges by establishing a quality-assured pipeline with improved speed. The authors took advantage of the enhanced speed of the pipeline to estimate the outcomes for a variety of lane management plans and determine the significance of those impacts by running several replicates of each scenario.====The paper is organized as follows.

Performing a scenario analysis capturing the planned policies and goals indicated in the NECPs, we estimate that the biofuel strategy can deliver a GHG reduction of up to 19 MtCO2eq (−3.6%), while the electrification strategy can deliver a GHG reduction up to 45 MtCO2eq (−8.3%). Jointly used, the GHG reduction could reach up to 64 MtCO2eq (−11.9%).","In 2017, the transport sector generated 27% of total EU-28 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (22% if international aviation and maritime emissions are excluded),==== equal to 1104 million tonnes CO2-equivalents (MtCO2eq) and 28% above the 1990 levels. International aviation was responsible for the largest percentage increase in GHG emissions over 1990 levels (+129%), followed by international shipping (+32%) and road transport (+23%). GHG emissions need to fall by around two thirds by 2050, compared with 1990 levels, in order to meet the long-term 60% reduction target set out in the 2011 Transport White Paper. Road transport was responsible for 71.7% of the total GHG emissions, maritime transport for 13.3%, aviation for 13.9%, railways for 0.5%, and the other transport modes for the remaining 0.6%. Of the 71.7% road transport share, cars were responsible for 43.2%, heavy-duty trucks and buses for 18.7%, light duty trucks for 8.5% and motorcycles for 0.9%. Most countries, but Sweden and Lithuania, increased the GHG emissions from transport in the 1990–2017 period, some of them (e.g. Poland) by a very large margin (Fig. 1).====The increase of transport's GHG emissions took place while other sectors succeeded decreasing their share (Table 1). The data, available at aggregate level also for the year 2018, indicate that the overall GHG emissions decreased by 21%. Transport is the only sector increasing in absolute terms.====In order to contribute to reduce GHG emissions and limit the average temperature growth, transport is, hence, a key sector. In this paper, we will not discuss the causes of the growth of transport's GHG emissions but rather on the efforts and procedures set up at European level to contain and possibly reduce them. The EU has enacted several pieces of legislation trying to curb GHG emissions. Since the energy sector is responsible for more than 50% of the EU's GHG emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy has been considered a key building block to achieving climate neutrality. A major first piece of legislation has been the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC). It set the target to generate at least 20% of the total energy needs with renewable energy by 2020 to be achieved through the attainment of individual national targets. With specific regards to transport, the goal was for all EU countries to ensure that at least 10% of their transport fuels came from renewable sources by 2020. Every two years, EU countries were required to report on their progress. So far, 5 out of 6 reports have been published in the EU directive website.==== In December 2018, the EU enacted the recast Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU) to reinforce the goals and obligations, in accordance with the Paris agreement. The Directive sets the following binding targets to be achieved by 2030:====The Directive includes new provisions for enabling self-consumption of renewable energy, an increased 14% target for the share of renewable fuels in transport by 2030 and strengthened criteria for ensuring bioenergy sustainability. Only biofuels complying with the sustainability criteria set in the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive (2009/30/EC) are considered for this target. In order to ensure a coordinated approach across the Union, each Member State (MS) was required to submit by December 31, 2018 a draft of a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for the 2021–2030 period. The NECPs outline how the EU countries intend to address energy efficiency, renewables, GHG emissions reductions, interconnections, research and innovation. On September 2020, the Commission published a detailed EU-wide assessment of the final NECPs with guidance on their implementation. Other major pieces of legislation of the EU's policy to combat climate change are the 2005 EU emissions trading system (EU ETS), operating on the ‘cap and trade’ principle which generated the world's first and largest major carbon market, the Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting new CO2 emission standards for cars and vans and Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 setting CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.====This paper has two main goals: draw a summary picture of the progress made towards transport decarbonisation in Europe based on the national reports for the years 2015 and 2018, and identify future developments on the basis of the NECPs concerning the 2020–2030 decade. To achieve the first goal, we have analyzed the 4th and 5th reports prepared by the MSs under the obligation of the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC), paying specific attention to the use of renewable resources in the transport sector. The national reports provided us with information on the total share of renewable energy used in transport (RES-T), on the amount of biofuels’ consumption and renewable electricity used in transport, and on the implemented and planned transport policies in the period 2015–2018. To achieve the second goal, we have compared the NECPs prepared by the MSs, with special attention to their goals concerning the RES-T and RES-E (share of electricity produced using renewable sources), and the planned transport policies for the decade 2020–2030. Based on such goals and policies, we estimated their potential to reduce GHG emissions. We developed a probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty in GHG emission factor parameters and performed scenario analyses based on a set of possible developments. The scenarios capture the two main strategies illustrated in the NECPs: the introduction of higher blending levels of biofuels (biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane) for the combustion engine cars and the electrification of the car fleet. We obtained results at country level, aggregated them at European level, and compared the relative effectiveness of the two strategies as well as their combined impact. The results indicate that significant (up to 11%) GHG emissions reductions are possible. Specific features of our study compared to the previous ones are the probabilistic approach, the joint analysis of both strategies (biofuels and electrification), the level of disaggregation, and the joint use of RES-T and RES-E goals to estimate the gains from electrification. The pros and cons of our estimates are further discussed in Section 5.3.4.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on decarbonising transport in the EU; Section 3 analyses the achievements and policies enacted in the period 2015–2018; Section 4 compares the NECPs in terms of goals and strategies; and Section 5 presents the GHG emission model, illustrates the scenarios and discusses the results. Section 6 summarizes the main findings.","Decarbonising transport in Europe: Trends, goals, policies and passenger car scenarios",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000408,19 April 2021,2021,Research Article,78.0

However, these studies largely ignore sectoral-level differences. We argue that as the contribution of different sectors to ","The transport sector undoubtedly plays an important role in creating employment opportunities, boosting economic activity, and improving social well-being. However, it is equally important to notice that such enhancements do not come for free, but at an environmental cost. Put it differently, as the transport sector depends heavily on oil resources to meet its energy needs, despite its economic advantages, it is generally regarded as one of the important source of CO2 emissions. Therefore, it has a substantial potential to deteriorate the quality of the environment and harm human health (Gasparatos et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Liu & Feng, 2020; Amin et al., 2020).==== Recent data also strongly confirm the worrying potential of this sector. For example, the European Environment Agency (EEA) (2019) data show that the transport sector CO2 emissions represent more than one-fourth of total EU28 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2017. While other sectors such as industry, residential, and agriculture, have a downward trend over the period between 1990 and 2017, the transport sector has not shown the same gradual decline in GHG emissions and its emissions are still higher than in 1990. In other words, with a roughly 20% increase in emissions, the transport is the only sector that experiences an upward trend between 1990 and 2017.==== From this point of view, reducing and controlling fossil energy use of the transport sector by empirically investigating its possible determinants is considered a critical path for both mitigating CO2 emissions and coping with global climate change. This is because such an empirical investigation can substantially help researchers and policy-makers develop climate change mitigation policies for the transport sector (Lin & Xie, 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Liu & Feng, 2020).====Concerning the determinants of CO2 emissions, the environmental impact of technological progress is one of the highly discussed issues in the existing literature as technological innovation is seen as an important factor that might have an impact on energy consumption and air pollution (Sohag et al., 2015). While some studies suggest that energy innovation helps to reduce carbon emissions, others express their concerns about the negative environmental impacts of technological progress (Mingay, 2007; Cai et al., 2013; Dedrick, 2010). This controversial debate can also be supported by the data. According to the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) (2020), for example, while information and telecommunication technology (ICT) has a substantial potential to reduce global emissions by about 7.8 GtCO2e (billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent) by 2020 in a business as usual (BAU) scenario, the ICT sector emissions are likely to grow and projected to triple between 2002 and 2020.====The impact of technology on the environment occurs in four different ways: substitution, dematerialization, rebound, and compensation effects. While the substitution and dematerialization effects refer to the positive impact of technology on environmental quality, the rebound and compensation effects correspond to the negative impact. Therefore, the environmental implications of technological development are seen as critical to design effective and innovative policies for fighting against climate change due to its two possible opposite effects (Anon Higon et al., 2017; Asongu, 2018; Danish, 2019; Majeed, 2018; Ozcan & Apergis, 2018; Ulucak et al., 2020).====A growing number of empirical studies have been conducted so far in the current literature to explore the link between CO2 emissions and technological progress.==== Based on these studies and their key findings, several points need to be emphasized. First, as discussed above, a general and clear consensus regarding the overall contribution of technological development to carbon emissions has not yet been reached. Many factors seem to play a key role in explaining these distinctive results, such as differences in the dataset used, sample & period covered, or employed estimator. Second, a vast majority of these empirical studies are conducted at the country level and the heterogeneous impact of technological progress on different sectors still remains unclear. It means that these studies largely ignore the sectoral-level differences and mainly focus on country-specific evidence. We argue that as all sectors do not contribute to CO2 emissions at the same level, the impact of technological progress on carbon emissions might vary significantly across sectors (Erdogan et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Shan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). While some sectors appear to be highly vulnerable to technological development possibly due to differences observed in their production process, the impact of technology on others might be limited to some extent due to, for example, path-dependent increasing returns to scale==== or rebound effect.==== Therefore, an empirical investigation of this relationship from an aggregate perspective might prevent us from developing sector-specific strategies, especially for the transport sector, which has a worrying CO2 emissions trend as discussed above.====Based on the premises above, this study attempts to explore the impact of environmental technologies on CO2 emissions from the transport sector. For that purpose, it covers the EU15 member states for the period between 1977 and 2015. Unlike many existing empirical studies, we pay special attention to the carbon emissions from the transport sector for the EU15 countries. ==== From this point of view, it is believed to offer a significant contribution to the literature as it is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to investigate the relationship between environmental technologies and CO2 emissions from the transport sector for the EU15 members.====We consider that both the increasing trend seen in the CO2 emissions from the transport sector in the EU and some important features and roles of this sector within the union, especially in combating climate change,==== clearly show us the necessity of conducting such an empirical investigation in this direction for the EU. Put it differently, the EU sets itself some specific targets to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector and implements several policies and strategies. As set out in the 2011 White Paper for Transport (EC, 2011b), the EU targets for reducing GHG emissions from the transport sector to a level that is 60% below that of 1990 by 2050. This includes a medium-term target of reducing transport sector GHG emissions by 20% by 2030, compared with 2008 levels. It is, however, equally important to note that this sector is not included in the European Union-Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). This reduction target is, therefore, regarded as the responsibility of member states through national policies (EEA, 2019).====Our empirical analysis is based on three different mean group estimators: the Pesaran and Smith (1995) mean group (MG), the Pesaran (2006) common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG), and the Eberhardt and Teal (2010) augmented mean group (AMG). We have used these estimators as they overcome the cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity problems in macro panel data. The variables used in the study are compiled from three different data sources: Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) database, and World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) (Crippa et al., 2019; OECD, 2020; World Bank 2020). The findings suggest that environmental technologies have a statistically insignificant positive impact on the transport sector CO2 emissions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature on the relationship between technological advances and carbon emissions.

The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated in a case study in Turkey. The evaluation findings show that the ranking results are robust and the ==== emission criterion is found to be the dominant criterion in the multi-criteria decision-making model proposed in this paper.,"Climate change is one of the most challenging problems in today's world. As one of the most generated greenhouse gasses (GHG), carbon dioxide ==== has an increasing effect on global warming (Ritchie & Roser, 2017). The USA has one of the highest ==== emissions per capita (Ritchie & Roser, 2017) and it continues to increase each year. Even though the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that total ==== emissions will decrease until 2020 because of the change from fuel to electricity ==== the world ==== emissions are expected to increase by the end of 2050 especially among non-OECD member countries (Marchal et al., 2011).====The construction sector is responsible for 39% of ==== emissions in 2018, including the manufacturing of the materials (Guggemos & Horvath, 2005). Besides, the substantial usage of nonrenewable energy makes the construction sector even more critical, and there is room for further improvements to reduce ==== emissions created by the construction industry (BIS, 2010; Levermore, 2008). Therefore, life cycle analysis (LCA) is an important concept for the construction industry and was investigated in recent years. Yet, the focus of LCA analysis in the sector is buildings rather than infrastructure facilities (Atmaca & Atmaca, 2015; Guggemos & Horvath, 2005; Kua & Maghimai, 2017; Levermore, 2008; Stephan & Stephan, 2016).====Here, another important source of ==== is the materials used that ranges from the substitution of the materials such as asphalt (Mladenovič et al., 2015), sand (Kua, 2013), and even cement (Crossin, 2015). In the US to minimize the environmental damages of bridge paints, new coating systems are developed (Itoh & Kitagawa, 2003). A study discusses the different ==== emissions of steel and concrete and found that reinforced concrete has lower embodied energy depending on the case (Kua & Maghimai, 2017). Another study investigates the usage of alternative structural systems extensively by considering many elements such as materials, transportation, and fuel emissions (Cole, 1998).====The concept of embodied energies is especially important for infrastructures such as roads, bridges, and tunnels because they are the reason for over 90% of life cycle emissions (Huang et al., 2015; Stephan & Stephan, 2016). The LCA studies test that infrastructure construction is mainly based on material use (Huang et al., 2015). The same applies to maintenance activities. The operational energy that includes the heating, cooling, etc. of the building covers most of the ==== emissions of a building. Yet, for a bridge, this stage does not include many aspects. Therefore, the major source of ==== emissions is the construction and maintenance of the bridges. In this paper, the ==== emission is much more tested as an additional fuel consumption because of truck detours.====Testing alternatives should not only base on traditional cost evaluation methods. Instead, it should consider environmental costs as an important parameter. In this perspective, this study aims to develop a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology to assess the bridge maintenance projects based on their ==== emissions. Especially, in the analysis section of this paper, it is shown that the highest importance weight among the criteria is assigned to the ==== emissions by the decision-makers, which also supports the claim of this paper. One contribution of this paper is to propose a new model to assess different maintenance projects by taking the environment into the heart of the methodology.====This study proposes a new hybridizing type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) based fuzzy WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) and TOPSIS (Technique For Order Preference By Similarity To An Ideal Solution) model to prioritize the bridge maintenance projects. One of the major contributions of this study is to present a prioritizing tool using expert knowledge.

These orientations are: convenience, status, health, privacy, safety-security, economic, environmental, impact, justice-equity, geographical, and problem-solution. Using a novel and systematic method, we perform the study in three stages. First, using online media as data source, we apply concordance and Gioia methods to identify the rhetorical orientations underpinning these texts. Second, we cluster the orientations according to the direction (pro- or anti-sustainability) being generally pushed by each orientation. Convenience, status, health, privacy, safety-security orientations, ====, push towards anti-sustainability direction. On the other hand, economic, environmental, impact, justice-equity, and geographical orientations generally push towards pro-sustainability direction. Meanwhile, problem-solution orientation appears equally in both clusters. Finally, we extract the semantics of each rhetorical orientation using collocation analysis to differentiate their vocabularies. Our findings show the discursive struggle and contestation in relation to mobility, which manifest not only in the differences in rhetorical orientations appropriated but also the vocabularies deployed. One important implication is that any attempt to render the messages promoting sustainable travel behavior more persuasive necessitates the de-legitimation of contrary rhetorical orientations (convenience, status and health, privacy and safety-security) by addressing the issues associated with them.","How to make pro-environmental messages more persuasive is a major concern for many individuals, organizations and policy-makers implementing campaigns to promote sustainable behavior, policies and cultural practices. Most of the literature show that these campaigns design their appeals on the premise that a message is more persuasive if it is congruent to the recipient's values, goals, personality, motivation, stage of change or beliefs (Stern & Dietz, 1994; Thøgersen, 2006; Lindenberg & Steg, 2007; De Groot & Steg, 2008; Hirsh, Kang, & Bodenhausen, 2012). Others have likewise featured campaigns that craft pro-environmental messages which together combine and align descriptive norms (what people typically do) and injunctive norms (what people typically approve or disapprove) in their presentation of appeal (Cialdini, 2003). Meanwhile, there have also been environmental messages based on framing strategies (e.g. gains and losses, current and future generations, ‘taking less’ as in conservation or ‘doing more’ as in recycling) (Cheng, Woon, & Lynes, 2011; Davis, 1995).====In the specific domain of promoting sustainable travel behavior, various interventions based on persuasive communication and informational strategies have been implemented to influence behavior at the individual level (Fujii & Taniguchi, 2006; Steg & Vlek, 2009; Davies, 2012; Taniguchi, Fujii, Azami, & Ishida, 2014; Pangbourne, Bennett, & Baker, 2020). An example is personalized tailoring of appeals based on the individual's motivational stage of change (Bamberg, 2013; Sunio & Schmöcker, 2019). Another example is the provision of feedbacks processed from the person's travel diaries (Fujii & Taniguchi, 2006; Jariyasunant et al., 2015). More examples are provided by Sunio and Schmöcker (2017) in their review of various persuasion strategies by a number of travel behavior change programs. These campaigns typically target change of individual behavior, but other informational initiatives have also been done targeting policy change at the national level (Hiselius & Rosqvist, 2016; Arsenio, Martens, & Di Ciommo, 2016). Specifically, these society-level campaigns aim to contest dominant cultural logics, redefine ways people think about sustainability, and effect broader cultural changes, thus contributing to decarbonization of transport and sustainability transitions (Köhleret al., 2019; Hiselius & Rosqvist, 2016).====The current research departs from the approach of extant transportation literature by bringing explicitly to the fore the ==== of ==== in designing persuasive messages encouraging sustainable mobility. Generally, the notion of mobility encompasses movements of goods and people (Kiba-Janiak & Witkowski, 2019) but in this study mobility considered here concerns primarily passenger or people movement.==== The broader literature on persuasion has long considered rhetoric as a significant device to persuade and change systems of practice (Kennedy, 2009). Rhetoric is the art of persuasion by words, and is concerned with how language may influence the way an audience thinks, feels or acts. This suggests that in changing mobility behavior, policies and practices towards sustainability, information campaigns that proficiently use rhetoric can be persuasive (Anagnostopoulou, Bothos, Magoutas, Schrammel, & Mentzas, 2018; Cheng et al., 2011). Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, focus on rhetorical orientation of messages remains understudied in the transportation literature.====This paper has two main objectives:====To tackle the above-mentioned objectives, an ==== was conducted focusing on Metro Manila (MM), the metropolitan capital of the Philippines.

Emissions from the transportation sector are a major contributor to climate change (Hoen & Koetse, 2014; Shepherd et al., 2012). The transportation sector solely accounts for 24% of global CO==== emission and is identified as its fastest growing source, where road transport is the primary contributor (Choudhary et al., 2021). Economic development, in an emerging country such as India, is creating a wave of rapid urbanization as the rural population is moving towards the cities for employment (Bera & Maitra, 2019). With this rapid urbanization, the confluence of factors such as growing working population, higher purchasing power, improved standard of living, and easy availability of car finance options at a reasonable rate of interest, are leading to huge growth of passenger car ownership, with the demand largely concentrated in urban areas (Miglani, 2019). As a result, urban air pollution has become a major challenge to transportation professionals, where vehicular emissions account for more than 60% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Ramachandra et al., 2015). Furthermore, the per-capita car ownership in India is expected to grow from 22 cars per 1000 persons in 2019 to 170 cars per 1000 persons by 2040 (Bhowmick et al., 2019), indicating the subsequent impact on the environment due to increased vehicular pollution. Urban areas in India largely have road-based transport, and the road transport sector is entirely dependent on fossil-fuel based transportation (Ahmed et al., 2020). India has now replaced Japan as the world's third largest oil importer after United States (US) and China (Wang & Li, 2016). India's dependence on foreign oil exceeded 80% in 2016, and is further expected to increase with the rapidly growing passenger car market (Li & Wang, 2019). Therefore, the prevailing dependency on fossil-fuel for transportation is highly unsustainable, and there is a need to shift towards cleaner and low-carbon emitting alternatives.====Electric vehicles have received significant global attention due to their strong potential to meet environmental and energy-security objectives (Nie et al., 2018; Vergis & Chen, 2015). India, the world's fourth largest CO==== emitter after China, Europe, and US has also recognized the need to shift towards electric vehicle technologies (IEA. Global EV Outlook, 2019). In 2013, India prepared a national mission document called National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, which aimed to achieve a target of about 6–7 million electric vehicles in India by 2020 (GoI, 2012). In 2015, as a part of NEMMP 2020, Government of India (GoI) formulated a scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) in 2015 (GoI, 2015). Under the FAME scheme, the Government of India allocated an estimated sum of US$48 million for providing subsidies towards the purchase of electric vehicles. Despite government subsidies, India's overall share of electric vehicles is still below 1 percent (IEA. Global EV Outlook, 2019). This issue could be attributed to the non-inclusion of future consumers' requirements into the current vehicular technology and promotions. Therefore, it is essential to understand the requirements of consumers in general and specifically for Indian metropolitan cities such that appropriate manufacturing requirements and suitable government policies to increase the market share of electric vehicles could be identified. Different types of electric vehicles such as Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), etc. have been investigated by past researchers to identify consumer preferences for electric vehicles (Higgins et al., 2017; Lebeau et al., 2012; Potoglou & Kanaroglou, 2007). These vehicles have their own merits and demerits as an alternative option to Conventional Vehicles (CVs) (Ahmadian et al., 2020). For a typical Indian context, the present investigation is carried out with reference to PHEV. PHEV operates on a battery capable of powering the vehicle for short distances, which can be recharged externally by plugging into an electrical outlet (Neves et al., 2019). PHEVs offer driving range comparable to that of CVs due to the readily available fuel for long-distance travel. PHEV uses grid electricity to displace nearly 40–60% of petroleum consumption (Elgowainy et al., 2009).====With this background, this study aims to investigate consumer preferences for PHEVs by estimating both user-perceived benefits associated with PHEV-related attributes, and potential demand shift from CV to PHEV in a typical Indian context.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. A brief review of existing research literature and scope of this study is presented in the next section. The survey design and data collection process are illustrated in section 3, followed by discussion on model specification in section 4. The data analysis and results are presented in section 5. Subsequently, the policy interventions for penetration of PHEV are discussed in section 6. Finally, the conclusions derived from the present study are summarized in section 7.",Assessing consumer preferences for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): An Indian perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001335,29 November 2021,2021,Research Article,89.0

This paper views the conversation about access to rail infrastructure as an institutional matter substantially independent from economic debates regarding rail organization.====This research identifies a taxonomy of six access protocols which describe distinct arrangements for the use of railways, considers the conditions conducive to each institutional structure, and illustrates each category with actual examples from across the world. This effort seeks to expand the debate about railroad institutional structures to include the full panoply of existing access arrangements.","This paper takes a new look at an issue often taken for granted: the ownership and control of railways (Moyer & Thompson, 1992; Posner, 2001; Gómez-Ibáñez 2004). Historically, railroads were vertically integrated, with track functions (e.g., dispatching, maintenance) and train operations conducted by the same entity. When railways were brand new in the 1830s, there was some thought of opening the tracks to any user willing to pay to operate on the line, much like a turnpike for road traffic; but, before the invention of the telegraph, it was difficult to communicate to train crews what trains were authorized to be on what tracks (an issue not arising for highways). Furthermore, no other would-be operators emerged, perhaps due to the capital cost of cars and locomotives. Therefore, track ownership, capacity management, and train operations became closely linked, establishing vertical integration worldwide (Jahanshahi, 1998, p. 73).====However, starting in the mid-1980s, vertical integration has been contested by another paradigm, infrastructure separation, which divorces track ownership from train operations (Gibb et al., 1996; Irvine, 1987, p. 20; Tye, 1987). First implemented in 1988 in Sweden as a cost transparency measure (Larsson, 2001), infrastructure separation became European Union (EU) policy in 1993 when Directive 91/440 took effect (Ludewig & Brinckman-Salzedo, 2008). Following this decision, robust debate emerged in the EU as to how infrastructure separation should be implemented (Cantos et al., 2010; Cremer et al., 2009), and infrastructure separation entered the US rail policy conversation, also fueled by shipper concerns about the pricing power of the largest (Class I) freight railroads (De Vany et al., 1997; Jahanshahi, 1998; Allen, 2000; Evans, 2002; Preston, 2002; Sonstegaard, 2003).====But there is more to the institutional variety in the rail industry than a dualistic split between vertical integration and infrastructure separation. This Manichaean dichotomy unduly narrows the debate about optimal rail policy by overlooking the institutional variation in rail access possibilities (Thompson and Helene, 1998; Hylén, 2001). This paper seeks to expand that discussion by presenting a wider array of existing access arrangements. This research draws on institutional and operating experience from railroads in North America (Allen & Newmark, 2019; Winston et al., 2011) and railways in other parts of the world (Dunn et al., 2001; Lu, 2002; Gómez-Ibáñez 2004; Gómez-Ibáñez & de Rus, 2006; Drew, 2006; Friebel et al., 2007; Van de Velde, 2018; Finger & Montero, 2020) to identify six different access protocols.

Due to the high capital cost invested and high risks associated with subsequent returns, investors are concerned about future revenue. Charging high tolls from freight vehicles is a common practice, especially in urban areas. As a result, freight vehicles tend to divert from freeways (toll roads) to highways and arterial roads to minimize their costs, but this may cause more damage to infrastructure and environment, thus more costs for society and the environment. Consequently, developing an effective solution for toll charges for freight vehicles is a complex City Logistics problem involving multiple stakeholders with multi-objectives.====This research investigates total costs (economic, social and environmental) associated with freight transportation based on existing toll structures for a toll road in Melbourne, Australia. Using a real case study, a step by step process was developed to illustrate the inefficiencies that exist in the present rigid toll charging mechanisms and how these inefficiencies can be corrected considering multi-stakeholder objectives and the overall impacts. This research identifies an optimal set of solutions that can be considered by decision-makers for implementation considering trade-offs between multiple management objectives. By considering subsidies, this research also identifies a good practical solution for minimizing the total cost of urban freight transportation while satisfying the investor needs. This policy decision is illustrated and related issues are discussed.","Delivering goods to cities using various types of freight vehicles is essential for maintaining cities' economic and social functions. Nevertheless, it has received little attention from authorities in comparison to passenger movement (Holguín-Veras, 2010). Beyond the rational demand increase over time due to population growth in cities, there is an additional demand created for freight in urban transport networks as the retail sector seeks to minimize its costs by saving storage space and reducing storage periods. Innovative supply practices such as just-in-time deliveries and tailor-made urban goods deliveries have further increased demand for freight trips. With the increase in urban goods transportation, problems caused by urban freight have also grown rapidly, with congestion, environmental problems due to emissions and noise, safety problems, insufficient infrastructure (or insufficient maintenance) being typical examples, among others (OECD, 2003; Ville et al., 2013). Since the public funding available to the government is not sufficient to fulfill such greater demands for road infrastructure, many governments have made agreements with private investors to build and operate roads under public-private-partnerships (PPP) (Cheung & Chan, 2011; Wang & Zhao, 2014). PPP initiatives for road infrastructure development has become very popular around the world (Kwak et al., 2009) and is accepted by the public due to its inherent advantages such as expediting project completion, quality of construction, low cost, reduced uncertainties and improved diversity (Becker & Patterson, 2005; Kwak et al., 2009; Wang & Zhao, 2014).====In a PPP road project, capital investment (including maintenance cost and profit) is recovered from the toll revenue collected from road users. Toll charges are typically determined as a collaborative decision between the investors and a public authority. From the literature it was found that either toll charges are high in many facilities around the world or toll charge disparity exists between classes of vehicles (Holguín-Veras et al., 2006; Holguín-Veras & Cetin, 2009; Perera et al., 2016). However, one may argue that, from an investor's point of view, investors deserve a profit level above the market rate due to the massive long-term risks they accept. The uncertainty involved in demand forecasting and associated future revenue are the main risks faced by an investor in a PPP project. Besides, the number of contractual years in operation, political changes and technological changes over time are also risks for investors in a PPP project (Cheung & Chan, 2011). Thus, one of the important issues with PPP road projects is to determine toll charges which have a direct impact on major stakeholders (Yang et al., 2002; Yang & Meng, 2000). In other words, investors' monopolistic control over road infrastructure leads to toll decisions based on pure economic grounds, which has raised public concern (Wang & Zhao, 2014). Emphasizing the monopolistic behaviour of investors, recent literature has shown that the present trend is to charge high tolls for road users, especially for heavy vehicles, to maintain a high-profit margin for their investments and to lessen their payback period. As a result of high toll prices, some road users tend to avoid toll roads at any given time by diverting to the local road network, which leads to production of high externalities, such as Emissions, noise, accidents (crashes), congestion and infrastructure costs (Chen et al., 2018). Nevertheless, toll avoidance is a common practice all over the world (McKinnon, 2006; Quak & van Duin, 2010; Yang et al., 2002) when toll levels rise the problem gets aggravated. In simple terms, high toll prices move out more freight vehicles off the freeways creating more trouble to cities. For example, in Melbourne, Australia, toll charges for commercial vehicles on a major toll road through the city has been raised by more than 125% in the last two years. Since the Melbourne Metropolitan Region is known for heavy internal freight movements compared to the interstate freight movement by weight (Perera et al., 2018) the toll increases have had a significant impact on freight movements in and around the city.====Externalities including emissions, noise, accidents (crashes), congestion and infrastructure costs are attracting more attention now compared to the past (Perera & Thompson, 2020). The general public has now realized that even though they have no direct involvement in the operation of transportation, they can be substantially impacted by these externalities. Therefore, some argue that externalities need to be considered as an accrued cost, which should be recovered from actual pricing policies to enable an efficient and sustainable freight transportation system (Demir et al., 2015). Since heavy vehicles produce more externalities compared to light vehicles (Cruz et al., 2012; Swan and Belzer, 2010), increased attention has been given to the movement of heavy vehicles. Some studies in the past have analysed how a single externality such as emissions can be minimized in a network using tolls (Perera et al., 2020) but a reduction in all externalities has not considered to the best knowledge of the authors.====In this multiple stakeholder context, however, investors need to give some priority for returns they collect since otherwise, the whole PPP concept will fail sooner rather than later. As a result, there is clear evidence from the past and the present to think that toll charges should not be the only source of income for investors and its high time to look for other alternatives for more sustainable solutions for toll related problems. Simply because if toll is the only source of income for investors, it leads to number of problems as discussed above. For similar problems with multi-stakeholders where the government is the leading stakeholder, subsidies have been considered along with charges. Therefore, a subsidy to the investor in addition to the toll charges is been analysed in detail in this research which can minimize the issues discussed from the multi stakeholder view point. However, finding a balance point between toll and subsidy would be another serious issue which this research tries to solve.====Subsidies have been used successfully in the transportation industry but only limited studies have looked at subsidies for investors, especially in PPP projects. In addition, in most previous studies, subsides in association with tolls and toll roads have been discussed to improve user equity. This refers to toll amounts received from users or providing subsidies to users to maintain equity. Refer to Dial (1999), Kockelman and Kalmanje (2005), DeCorla-Souza (1994), Small (1992), Adler and Cetin (2001) for more details. However, there is a need to broaden the scope and investigate the extent to which subsidies to the investor can be used to manage multiple stakeholders in the toll charging problem.====In the domain of City Logistics research, the total cost optimisation principle has been studied in conjunction with urban consolidation centres (UCC), access control regulations to city centres, promoting off-peak hours deliveries, low emission zones and emission reduction models (Anand et al., 2012; Taniguchi et al., 2014; Ville et al., 2013). And similarly, there were number of studies investigating how partnership can contribute to solve City Logistics problems, in terms of direct infrastructure facilities such as using electric vehicles, development of UCC and intelligent transport systems, etc. or else focusing on identifying stakeholders and their needs and the local authorities’ responsibilities towards sustainable urban freight transportation (Browne et al., 2004; Lindholm, 2013; Lindholm & Browne, 2013). Gonzalez-Feliu et al., 2013, 2014 studied the financing options for City Logistics infrastructure development projects and attention was also paid to subsidies as well. However, road infrastructures developed under PPP and impact on City Logistics has received less attention in the past studies and thus, toll and subsidy approach for managing City Logistics is the main focus area in this research.====This research addresses the gaps identified above, investigating how to implement optimal toll charges on roads built under PPP to earn revenue (which will minimize externalities) and how toll increases can be controlled through government subsidies so that sustainable urban freight can be achieved while satisfying the inventors as needed. Optimal multi-class toll charges are identified for a given Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which can minimize externalities, that are measured in dollar terms (A$) and subsidies are proposed to investors as a recompense to the revenue loss. A bi-level model developed earlier was applied in this research to incorporate key stakeholder objective(s) and to find equilibrium solutions. A numerical example (case study) was used to illustrate the problem using a real network and optimum results are obtained using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II). Further, externalities are monetarized based on available Australian and international studies. In this research, based on the analysis of results produced by the model the policy decision of subsidies for road investors and what optimal toll scheme is suited for expected return is discussed with potential benefits. In other words, this research explores an improved practical solution to an existing problem in main cities by analysing outcomes of various toll levels (revenue) combined with government strategies such as subsidies.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the methodology used in this research, especially the model development, stakeholders and their objectives identification, externalities estimation, model development and the application of various models. Section 3 presents a case study that explains the development of a real-world road network and section 4 is dedicated to showing the results, followed by discussion.

Exploration of this phenomenon is significant in part because knowing who is likely to leave a trucking company helps ==== in trucking firms identify effective measures needed to reduce driver turnover. Estimation results of a discrete driver quit choice model along with findings from estimating a driver wage equation, are used to predict the driver compensation needed to mitigate high driver turnover. These findings show that at the mean, drivers who stay on the job receive $54.25 (2018 dollars) more per week than drivers who leave, which translates to $2836.20 annually and is 6.02% percent above the mean wage of drivers who leave their job. The value of this annual wage differential is less than the mean value of the conservatively low estimate of $3654.72 (2018 dollars) computed in past research as the per driver cost of truck driver turnover. We interpret these results to suggest that it is cost effective for trucking companies to increase driver compensation. Indeed, truck driver wage trends do show a recent pattern of wage gains.","In an increasingly hyper-competitive global business environment, access to an efficient and affordable transport system is essential to the success of US manufacturing, the online retailing sector, and to the US economy in general. The movement of cans, cars and construction materials (e.g. automotive, food and beverage, packaging, construction materials, and aircraft components transportation) has been a bellwether for the health of the economy. Shippers frequently rely on trucking transport services to deliver their products nationally as well as delivering these loads to ocean ports and airports for international shipment. In contrast to other modes of transportation such as rail, ocean liner, barge, and air, trucking is characterized by a large transportation operative workforce (especially for the market sectors above). For instance, by 2019 the work force for truck drivers totaled 3,098,643 drivers.==== In comparison, by 2019 rail transport services employed 124,268 transportation operatives; water transport services (barge and containerized ocean shipping) employed 62,892 transport operatives; and air transport services employed 234,023 transport operatives.==== Hence, the number of truck drivers employed in the US workforce by 2019 was 7.35 times as large as the number of transport operatives in other major transport sectors. Evidence of trucking's heavy reliance on a large pool of available drivers (and driver teams) indicates how important having a reliable and large pool of drivers is to this industry and to economic prosperity. The significance of these drivers to the operations of the trucking industry is depicted in part by the relatively high wages drivers employed in the trucking industry received prior to regulatory reform in this industry. For instance, past research by Hirsch, Macpherson, and Peoples (1998) report by 1979, the year usually viewed as preceding significant regulatory reform, drivers in the trucking industry received a 14.49 percent mean wage premium over an economy-wide control group of male non-professional employees.====Regulatory reform in the last quarter of the 20th century, though, changed the dynamics of the labor market for truck drives by providing trucking employers the negotiation leverage to set lower wage rates as an approach for maintaining competitiveness. Relatively lower wages have contributed to creating a labor market characterized by costly high turnover rates and an erosion of carriers’ access to a reliable pool of drivers.==== The American Trucking Association (ATA) reports that the turnover rate at large carriers reached 102 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 (ATA quarterly Trucking Activity Report, 2016). At this rate, a trucking company replaces slightly more than its entire driver payroll for the year 2015. By comparison, the US labor force turnover rate only reached 3.1 percent.==== Such high rates of labor churn (in this case truck driver) push trucking costs higher (direct and indirect) due to labor shortages and new-driver training requirements.==== These higher costs are inevitably passed on to shippers in the form of higher freight rates and shipment delays to customers. Moreover, high labor turnover disrupts the supply chain by reducing service capacity because less freight is hauled or delivery disruptions occur. Transportation safety risks also increase because trucking companies may be forced to routinely recruit newer, inexperienced drivers (Faulkner & Belzer, 2019; Cantor et al., 2011, Suzuki et al., 2009, pp. 538–550).====Given these examples of operational costs associated with high turnover rates and driver shortages, the persistence of driver turnover runs counter to economic theory. In the long-term markets should clear such that there is an absence of shortages and so that successful firms operate efficiently with minimal operational disruption associated with high turnover rates. In contrast, the duration of high turnover rates seems to indicate the labor market for truck drivers is broken. Past research, though, observes high driver churn is concentrated in the long-distance truckload segment of the industry and such labor market activity is not indicative of the overall trucking industry (Burks & Monaco, 2019).==== They observe the challenges posed by operating in a highly competitive market as an explanation of the persistence of high driver turnover in this segment. Burks and Monaco (2019) note in a competitive market high turnover is a cost-minimizing response to competitive price pressures from rivals. Further evidence suggesting the labor market for truck drivers is not broken is derived from examining whether high turnover rates present trucking companies the opportunity to achieve competitive rates of return (Suzuki, 2007). That research uses simulations to show trucking companies can achieve a competitive rate of return of 2.8 percent while operating with turnover rates equaling 116 percent. Critical to that analysis is the assumption of driver homogeneity. However, the industry employs drivers from diverse backgrounds. For example, approximately one-third of truck drivers are minorities (Source: Current Population Survey files). Given the possibility that drivers from different demographic groups have different quit rates, accounting for the heterogeneity of the workforce of truck drivers then would likely change the critical turnover level needed to achieve a competitive return.====This study relaxes the assumption of driver homogeneity when examining the operational cost of driver turnover. It is through our recourse to estimating a driver discrete choice model that driver characteristics are specified as determinants of the probability a driver will voluntarily leave his/her company. Mean findings on driver characteristics and their voluntary departure probability associated with those characteristics are then used to predict the potential gains from trucking employers targeting drivers who are less likely to leave the company. Additional driver wage estimations are used in conjunction with characteristic profiles of drivers who voluntarily leave and stay in order to compute the labor costs needed to mitigate driver turnover. The findings from these estimations depict a job-stayer vs job-leaver wage differential for drivers. This value is significant as it indicates how low of a wage a driver is willing to accept, all else equal, before quitting the job. This results in a threshold minimum incremental amount needed to pay drivers in order to mitigate labor turnover. This driver leaver-stayer wage differential is then compared with trucking companies’ turnover cost per driver which has been reported elsewhere in the literature (Suzuki, 2007). Comparing retention costs (the pay needed to mitigate labor turnover) with replacement costs contributes to our understanding whether trucking companies facing high turnover rates have the potential to generate profits exceeding competitive rates.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly describes the US motor carrier industry with a focus on those sectors prone to high turnover. This section also includes a discussion of the industry and driver characteristics associated with high turnover. Section 3 presents a conceptual framework, which is used to construct this study's hypotheses on driver turnover. Findings from past research are also presented in support of this study's hypotheses in that section. That section is followed by a description of the data sources and empirical approaches used to predict the probability of driver turnover and the minimum cost needed to retain the services of the typical truck driver.

Several studies have identified the main factors that model real estate value. Accessibility is one of those factors. This article describes the influence of transportation infrastructure on property valuations, using the mean value of real estate transactions in NUTS-III administrative regions of mainland Portugal as a proxy for valuation, based on an analysis of the period between 2000 and 2018. This study expands the existing body of knowledge by explicitly considering ==== from investing in infrastructure. A cross-regressive spatial model is developed with typical investment and infrastructure stock variables and more complex accessibility indicators. These indicators express different levels of accessibility within regions and are influenced by the development of both road and railway infrastructure. The results show evidence of spatial autocorrelation between real estate values, confirming that the positioning of each region is crucial for the development of the market. However, the results yielded by the cross-regression model are not consistent across all 23 regions, showing both positive and negative impacts of road infrastructure investment on real estate values.","Real estate prices and valuation are critical to an understanding of existing urban and regional economics patterns, and they are valuable in helping to forecast future real estate cycles with a real impact on policymaking (Brooks & Tsolacos, 2010). Real estate is the largest form of capital stock and, therefore, understanding the determinants of its value is advantageous for policy decision making. In fact, there is a substantial body of knowledge in the field of real estate valuation modelling, which, in essence, focuses on identifying the relevant factors and their quantitative influences (Ibeas, Cordera, dell’Olio, Coppola, & Dominguez, 2012).====This research fits within the existing literature of real estate prices modelling, but it also augments the existing body of knowledge offering two distinct innovations: i) it makes no a priori assumption on which transport variables to use, and it considers physical infrastructure stock (e.g., network km), simple accessibility metrics (e.g., travel time), and more complex accessibility indicators (e.g., weighted road accessibility indexes); and ii) it considers the potential spillover effects of improved infrastructure/accessibility on neighboring regions. To achieve this, we started by analyzing the spatial autocorrelation of real estate values across the country, followed by developing a cross-regressive model to account for spillover effects.====Our study's dependent variable is average transaction real estate prices within the NUTS-III administrative regions of mainland Portugal, based on an analysis of the years 2000–2018. During this period – in particular, during the first decade – Portugal witnessed significant investment in infrastructure (Pereira & Pereira, 2017), similar to that experienced in Spain in the 1990s and 2000s (Holl, 2007) and Poland in more recent years (Komornicki, 2007; Stępniak, Rosik, & Komornicki, 2015).====The existing literature suggests that there are signs of a positive impact of infrastructure investment on property values (e.g., Bowes & Ihlanfeldt, 2001; Cohen & Paul, 2007; Shin, Washington, & Choi, 2007). Even on the scale of cities, Martinez and Viegas (2009) concluded that increased accessibility in urban areas leads to increased property valuations. Our literature review will provide a careful analysis of these existing studies.====Our paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, section 2 presents a review of the literature.

In this paper, we explore the relationship between railway networks and real GDP controlling for energy consumption, over the period 1861–1970 in Italy. The empirical strategy uses both AutoRegressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) model and the Wavelet Analysis (WA), which is able to ==== support====. Our applied findings show that the two series are generally positive correlated (being in phase), but also that railway networks cause real value added in the long-run. Thus, through an innovative approach, we can confirm previous results in literature: in fact, railway networks represent a determinant of economic growth in the Italian case.","This study aims to analyze the relation among railway networks, energy consumption, and real value added in the transport and communications sectors for Italy in the long-term (1861–1970). With the fast social and economic development in the world, railway transportation plays an increasingly important role. As more railway industry expands, reduction in energy consumption and pollutant emissions in railway systems constitutes a key factor for further deployment of railway transportation (Gu et al., 2010). The evolution of the variables is crucial to understand the causal links, and determine the contribution (if any) that the infrastructure gave to the development process of the country. Infrastructure contributes to economic growth in two ways: (1) provides services in residential consumption bundles, which increases the quality of life and (2) provides inputs, which augments other factors of production in the private sector (Ayogu, 2007; Kessides, 1993, p. 213). Moreover, Bougheas et al. (2000) assert that infrastructural investment promote specialisation, which leads to economic growth. The link between infrastructural development (mostly public funded) and economic development/output has been a longstanding issue in the development economics literature, albeit both the theoretical and empirical literature remain inconclusive as to whether infrastructure contributes to economic growth/output or not. Theoretically, the capital hypothesis emphasizes the positive contributions of infrastructure to private sector output, productivity and capital formation (Rosenstein-Rodan, 1943). According to this view, public infrastructure provides direct inputs into private sector output and enhances the productivity of other inputs (i.e., labor and capital). Thus, the capital hypothesis argues that public infrastructure complements private capital formation, leading to economic growth/output (Ayogu, 2007). On the contrary, the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis argues that some services that are provided by private capital are substitutes to those from public capital (Aschauer, 1985). Therefore, by increasing public capital infrastructure, it lowers the return on private capital and thereby ‘crowds out’ private capital formation and hence lower output. In other words, according to the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis, there is a resource cost of infrastructural investment.====The above suggests that the approach to analyze the transportation infrastructure – economic growth nexus should be capable to capture simultaneously the scale, frequency, and potential nonlinearity associated with the relationship. However, current methodological approaches adopted in the literature, at best, are capable of addressing either one of these issues or a combination of any of them in an independent way. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by using the wavelets method to study the economic growth–infrastructure nexus in Italy, in a secular perspective. Not with standing, we complement the wavelet analyses (WA) with a novel time-series estimator, the Dynamic AutoRegressive Distributed Lag (DYNARDL), as well as with the ARDL bound test. Moreover, we used the recently reconstructed data provided by ISTAT.====The ability of wavelet methods to adopt to scale and time support enables one to escape the Heisenberg's curse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies the wavelet analysis to the Italian railway data.==== ==== ==== literature.

However, as the global epidemic control situation improves, the pace of recovery of the air transport industry is also accelerating. Although the measures taken by countries in response to the COVID-19 have led to a decline in air transportation demand and carbon emissions, this downward trend was short-term, as the society's economic, transportation, and energy operation patterns of the whole society have not structurally changed. The long-term forecast of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) shows that global passenger traffic will return to the level of 2019 by around 2024.====According to the IATA statistics in 2019, worldwide air passenger numbers continued to rise, moving beyond 4.5 billion passenger journeys on a flight-segment basis, and demand for air passenger services remained solid, with industry-wide RPKs increasing 4.2% (IATA, 2020). However, the increasingly serious air pollution problem cannot be ignored. According to IATA's estimation, CO==== emission from domestic and international flights around the world in 2019 was about 927 million tons, accounting for about 2.4% of the global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, and this proportion was expected to increase in the coming decades (IATA, 2020). The increasing awareness of energy conservation and environmental protection has brought great pressure on Air Transportation industry to reduce emissions.====Airlines and aviation organizations around the world have recognized the impact of international aviation emissions on global climate, and are determined to minimize the impact while ensuring the sustainable growth of international aviation. They have made many efforts and attempts in formulating aviation carbon emission abatement policies and strengthening environmental regulations. In January 2012, the European Union formally incorporated the aviation industry into the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS). This regulation was not only applicable to European Union airlines, non-EU flights that take off and land within the EU were also compulsory for taxation. The rationality, legality of taxation measures and emission abatement effect have been questioned and protested by other countries, so EU ETS has not formed a global action framework for aviation carbon abatement (EU ETS, 2020).====At the 39th Session of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in 2016, States finally adopted a global market-based measure scheme for international aviation, in the form of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), to achieve the goal of carbon neutral growth from 2020(CNG2020 strategy). CORSIA represents a cooperative approach that moves away from a “patchwork” of national or regional regulatory initiatives through the implementation of a global scheme that has been developed through global consensus among governments, industry, and international organizations (ICAO, 2020). It offers a harmonized way to reduce emissions from international aviation ensuring that there is no market distortion, while respecting the special circumstances and respective capabilities of ICAO Member States. CORSIA is the first global market-based measure and the only global industry market emission abatement mechanism applicable to international aviation carbon emissions (Li & Cui, 2017). Studies have shown that green investment policies will have more advantages than traditional fiscal stimulus policies. Therefore, under the major impact of the COVID-19 on the economy, most countries, especially developed countries, have introduced economic recovery plans, and part of the investment has entered green fields such as clean transportation and clean energy, the CNG2020 strategy will promote the formulation and implementation of the green recovery plan.====The analysis of emission abatement behavior and potential at the industry or sector level can provide a good reference for decision-making in the sharing of emission abatement responsibilities in related industries, so as to promote the realization of overall emission abatement targets in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, considering the influence of aviation carbon emission abatement policies, scientifically and reasonably estimating the emission abatement costs in the production and operation of airlines and formulating targeted strategies is the prerequisite for achieving the global ideal goal of carbon neutral growth. With increasing attention to environmental and energy issues, scholars have carried out many studies on energy efficiency and emission abatement behaviors of various sectors, but these studies were mainly concentrated in the industrial sector, the agricultural sector, and the road transportation sector et al. However, researches on the abatement potential and cost of the air transportation were scarce.====A new network environment production function was proposed by Cui et al. (2017) to discuss the changes in pollution abatement costs of 12 European airlines with or without the EU emissions trading system, the results of the study showed that EU ETS had little impact on pollution abatement costs. Cui (2017) applied the network environment production function to 29 international airlines' abatement costs to study the impact of CNG2020 strategy on airlines' abatement costs. Cui et al. (2018) defined the pollution abatement cost (PAC) as the ratio of the output when the undesirable outputs were freely disposed to the outputs when the undesirable outputs were weakly disposed, and used the dynamic environmental DEA model to calculate the change index of pollution abatement cost of 18 international airlines. However, there is currently no relevant research on the impact of the introduction of CNG2020 strategy on airlines' abatement costs.====The key issues that this paper attempts to solve include: 1. How to select appropriate model methods to measure and analyze the airlines' pollution abatement costs? 2. How to analyze the impact of the CNG2020 strategy on airlines' pollution abatement costs? 3. How to compare the change characteristics of the abatement costs of various airlines before and after the CNG2020 strategy was proposed? Based on the above problems, this paper incorporates the price of input and output into the second-stage network environment production function, and proposes a new Profit Pollution Abatement Costs (PPAC) index, which better correlates pollution abatement costs with profits, and is more suitable for Input-output is the case of physical indicators. PPAC was used to discuss the differences in abatement costs for airlines before and after the CNG2020 strategy was proposed.====The remainder of this paper is organized as: Section 2 proposes the literature review.

However, freight consolidation initiatives lack a focus on financial viability early in project design. Dependence on government subsidies is a typical long-term outcome. Thus, this study presents a theoretical cost model to explore the profitability of an inner-city freight consolidation facility and determine the operational variables that derive a profitable facility. The analytical approach develops a mixed integer linear programming cost model to optimise the facility's profitability. A unique aspect is that the model considers the stochastic demand for consolidated delivery services from other freight carriers The numerical solution of the model produced using a genetic algorithm estimated that personnel costs comprise the largest share of total costs. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis reveals that the vehicle fill-in rate has the greatest effect on profitability. Unlike other studies in the literature, this study provides evidence that these facilities could be profitable without government subsidies. The findings offer valuable insights about the development of financial and non-financial incentives to support freight consolidation venture. As a guide for the future, the model provides a theoretical basis to evaluate planned consolidation facilities.","Freight carriers experience increasing difficulties when involved in delivery and pick-up activities in inner-city areas due to traffic congestion, diverse delivery requirements of receivers, and limited parking infrastructure (Marcucci et al., 2015). This causes wasted resources and unreliable operations in the last leg of delivery for freight carriers as compared to the overall freight transport network (Behrends, 2016). As well, the increasing movements of freight vehicles negatively affect the liveability and amenity of the area due to traffic accidents, harmful emissions, safety hazards, noise and visual pollution (Browne et al., 2012).====Focusing only on freight solutions such as promoting eco-friendly vehicles, congestion charging, or off-peak deliveries overlooks the fact that freight land-use as well as shippers and receivers’ delivery requirements highly dictate the operational practices of freight carriers (Aljohani & Thompson, 2018, pp. 23–46). Freight consolidation schemes offer an alternative solution for freight carriers. Freight carriers could transfer their parcels to an intermediate consolidation facility. These facilities would accept parcels from various delivery routes and under-utilised freight vehicles would be combined into optimised loads for neighbouring receivers (Browne et al., 2005). The literature used several terms interchangeably used in the literature to label consolidation facilities such as a freight consolidation facility (FCF), urban consolidation centre (UCC), urban distribution centre (UDC) and public logistics terminal. Overall, the consolidation scheme would result in improved vehicle fill rates, reduced distribution distance, and pre-retailing services to receivers (Allen at al. 2014). The consolidation facility provides participating freight carriers with a suitable alternative to avoid inefficient delivery operations in congested inner-city areas, which are typically the most expensive and least efficient link the overall urban freight transport network.====Vahrenkamp and Berlin (2016) reported that many consolidation initiatives throughout Europe have failed once the government subsidies stopped. A major reason for these failure was that consolidation projects overlooked examining the long-term financial viability of the consolidation facility in the early stages of planning and evaluation (Quak et al., 2014; Zunder & Marinov, 2011). This underlines the difficulties in establishing and operating financially viable consolidation facilities, i.e. a net profit-generating and self-sustaining facility without government financial incentives. However, there have been several successful consolidation facilities especially in Europe and Japan such. These include Motomachi UCC, Yokohama city, Japan (Taniguchi, 2014) and Bristol UCC, UK (Allen et al., 2014).====According to Björklund et al. (2017), previous studies of FCFs mostly stressed the operational, social, and environmental feasibility of the facility rather than the business and financial aspects. Janjevic and Ndiaye (2017a) and Estrada and Roca-Riu (2017) highlight that a limited number of mathematical cost models that perform an assessment of the financial viability for FCFs. It can also be argued that studies on FCFs missed quantifying the profitability of the facility when highlighting the operational conditions under which these facilities could be profitable. Moreover, the problem formulation for several cost models of FCFs uses a deterministic approach with known information. This ignores the uncertain nature of daily demand. Specifically, the literature does not include the case of dynamic demand shown by freight carriers involving transfers of their parcels into the FCF. This uncertainty has a profound effect on revenue estimates.====Therefore, this study examines the financial viability of a proposed inner-city freight consolidation facility. It offers a generalisable mathematical model. In this regard, the model forms a comprehensive theory for many instances existing in practice. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to optimise the profitability of a consolidation facility. The goal is to determine the operational specifics that could develop a financially viable consolidation facility without government subsidies. This makes a valuable contribution early in the planning process. The cost model includes various inbound parcel demand scenarios for the facility. This reflects the stochastic nature of the transfer of parcels into the facility by many freight carriers. A heuristic approach, namely a genetic algorithm, is applied to solve the optimisation problem. The cost model presented in this paper is theoretical and comprehensive. It applies to many different instances for a consolidation facility. The strength of the model is in quantifying the net profit by involving major and minor cost components for the facility. Moreover, sensitivity analysis offers an improved understanding of the variables that significantly affect the financial viability of the consolidation facility. With this level of analytical power, the benefit to policy making and the operation of consolidation facilities is significant.====This article is structured as follows: the next section evaluates the literature on the financial viability of consolidation facilities while section 3 presents the formulation of the MILP cost model. Section 4 describes the genetic algorithm used to solve the MILP cost model while section 5 analyses the computation results of the solution and the sensitivity analysis.

We analyzed air passengers' demands for international round-trip flights using an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) model. Most research on airline choice has only included observable factors. To fill this gap, this study hypothesized that the airline choice process depends not only on a set of measurable factors but also on passenger satisfaction which, in turn, is influenced by travelers' ","Predicting consumers' airline choice has become increasingly important, due to the competitive airline market (Belobaba, Odoni, & Barnhart, 2015). Airline choice behavior has been considered a key element in air transportation planning, as it is the basis for airline strategies. Particularly, consumers' flight choices are dependent not only on airline attributes but also on consumers' sociodemographic and traveler characteristics, perceptions, and motives. Therefore, understanding consumers’ decision-making processes is a key interest in air transportation research, and multidisciplinary approaches are often used to represent and predict traveler behavior. The DC model is a typical economic research method for analyzing consumer choice behavior. According to consumer choice behavior theory, a highly relevant aspect of decision-making is the important role passenger satisfaction plays in airline choice behavior (Adeola & Adebiyi, 2014). Thus, traveler satisfaction is a key element of any airline strategy program.====Several studies have considered the suggestion made by McFadden (1986) and have introduced attitude factors in choice models as explanatory variables. Within the field of air transportation, ICVL models have been developed to investigate airline itinerary choice. Theis, Adler, Clarke, and Ben-Akiva (2006) found three latent variables related to connection time that a passenger might consider when choosing an itinerary. The inclusion of the latent variables, the risk of misconnection, the discomfort associated with rushing through an airport terminal, and the trust in an airline to provide reliable connections demonstrated the effect of these variables on itinerary choice. Brey and Walker (2011) included the preferred travel time as a latent variable in a jointly estimated time of day and itinerary choice model. Regarding satisfaction latent variable, Ben-Akiva et al. (2002) analyzed a case study based on Polydoropoulou (1997), where the willingness to pay for advanced traveler information systems was estimated. The model included the latent variable of satisfaction as an explanatory variable in the usage decision. Thus, the utility was a function of the service attributes such as cost and payment method, as well as the overall satisfaction with the service. Tam, Lam, and Lo (2011) assessed the impact of satisfaction with service quality on airport ground access mode choice. The latent variable of satisfaction was included in the mode choice model as an explanatory variable, and it was found to be a larger magnitude compared to other variables. Besides, travel time, gender, age, and education level were identified as explanatory variables of the satisfaction latent variable. Ben-Akiva et al. (2002) and Tam et al. (2011) found that satisfaction latent variable had a positive estimated parameter. That implied that the utility increased with the traveler satisfaction level. They also found that including satisfaction in the utility function significantly improved the goodness-of-fit of the choice models.====Travelers' perceptions of various air carriers differ due to travelers' socioeconomic and personality characteristics and airlines’ intrinsic attributes, which cannot be directly observed or measured. Thus, airline choice behavior is influenced not only by measurable factors (e.g., travel time, airfare) but also by non-measurable factors, such as traveler satisfaction with airline service. Therefore, traveler satisfaction should be added to the DC model to include the influence of subjective factors on airline choice. Some researchers have identified a need to analyze how air traveler satisfaction relates to loyalty (Leong, Hew, Lee, & Ooi, 2015; Park, 2019). This highlights the importance of passenger satisfaction in airline choice and describes how specific airline attributes influence air travel demand, which is the first step toward ensuring more equitable and targeted strategy responses.====The most general framework for modeling latent variables has been proposed by Ben-Akiva et al. (2002) and it consists of two components. The structural model, in which the latent variable is explained by exogenous and endogenous variables, while the measurement model describes the relationship between the indicators and its corresponding latent variable. Most studies on latent variables (LVs) have only considered socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory variables in the structural (Dekker, Hess, Arentze, & Chorus, 2014; Li, Jia, Zhang, & Wang, 2019; Motoaki & Daziano, 2015; Yáñez, Raveau, & Ortúzar, 2010). Numerous studies have defined customer satisfaction in terms of psychological factors (Rust & Oliver, 1994; Cronin, Brady, Hult, & Tomas, 2000; Eklöf & Westlund, 2002; Matzler, Faullant, Renzl, & Leiter, 2005; Al-Refaie, Bata, Eteiwi, & Jalham, 2014; C.; Zhang, Liu, Lu, & Xiao, 2019). For example, Siddiqui (2012) and Castillo (2017) suggested that consumers' personality traits contribute to understanding customers’ satisfaction.====The above studies have identified psychological characteristics into customer satisfaction description. However, the role of personality traits in modeling LV has been ignored in the structural models. In this study, in addition to socioeconomic characteristics and air travel experiences, we considered personality traits as explanatory variables of air traveler satisfaction, which have not previously been reported in the literature of transportation choice. The modeling challenge is to develop an ICLV model that is not only able to predict air traveler preferences but also recognize the impact of perception variables (i.e., satisfaction with airline service) and psychological traits on traveler satisfaction. Although transportation research reflects a steady interest in ICLV models, none of the studies we examined applied this modeling approach to investigate the influence of passenger satisfaction on airline choice. Thus, to contribute to a better understanding of this field, this study included not only observable factors but also individual attitudes influencing airline choice.====To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to incorporate the influence of personality traits on passenger satisfaction with an airline and, in turn, the association of traveler satisfaction with airline choice preference for international round-trip flights. The model specification allowed for capturing population heterogeneity through LVs. The findings of the case study on international round-trip flights from Colombia corroborated our hypothesis that individual perceptions are crucial for airline choice and allowed for defining air carrier policies relying on travelers’ heterogeneity.====Our research contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we introduced the effect of traveler satisfaction with airline service on air carrier choice, which had not been covered in other studies within this field. For this purpose, customers’ satisfaction with each airline has been assessed. Second, we introduced personality traits as explanatory variables of traveler satisfaction. Although personality factors have been previously investigated in the transportation field, the influence of personality traits on traveler satisfaction has not been thoroughly examined.",Airline choice model for international round-trip flights: The role of travelers’ satisfaction and personality traits,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000937,31 August 2021,2021,Research Article,100.0

In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences approach to examine the causal effect of highway concessions on road safety outcomes using daily data from Brazilian Federal highways over 11 years between 2007 and 2017. We exploit the transition from public to private management in some but not all Brazilian states to provide both within- and between-states comparison. We find that concessions promote a small but significant reduction in the number and fatality of road crashes as well as and the number of people and vehicles involved in crashes. Between 2007 and 2017, procured roads had on average 16 fewer deaths then publicly managed highways for every 1000 crashes each year. These road safety benefits only become statistically significant a few years after a concession implementation, but they are marginally larger for every additional year of concession. Finally, our results suggest that including safety-based incentives in concession contracts can substantially improve road safety performance. The findings of the paper have important implications for the social and economic evaluation of road concessions and for road infrastructure policy more broadly.","Road traffic crashes represent the eighth leading cause of death globally, summing 1.35 mil-lion deaths and 50 million injured people each year (WHO, 2018). Various studies investigate how road safety is influenced by factors such as weather conditions (Theofilatos and Yannis, 2014; Brijs et al., 2008), speed limits and road design (Pauw et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013), law enforcement and awareness campaigns (Lewis et al., 2007), as well as individuals attitudes and skills (Shinar, 2017; Anstey et al., 2012). Nonetheless, there is still little understanding about whether the implementation of road concessions can help improve road safety performance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.====Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly common for governments to use road concessions via Public Private Partnerships (PPP) as an alternative means to finance and manage roads (Bel & Foote, 2009; Galilea & Medda, 2010; Albalate & Bel-Pinãna, 2019). Between 1990 and 2015, several countries worldwide have awarded over 950 PPP road projects totaling an investment of 267,039 million dollars (Albalate & Bel-Pinãna, 2019). A common motivation behind road procurement is the expectation that private sector operators can more efficiently upgrade and maintain road quality, bringing about both economic as well as road safety outcomes (Grimsey & Lewis, 2007). Nonetheless,private operators can often face potential conflicts of interest due to trade-offs between profits and the quality and safety of services (Hart, 2003), raising questions about whether road concessions could effectively bring any road safety benefits.====This paper examines the impact of road concessions on road safety outcomes using daily data aggregated by month and year on traffic crashes in all of Brazilian federal highways over a 11-year period between 2007 and 2017. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we test whether the introduction of road concessions significantly reduces the number and severity of road crashes in treated roads after concession. As exogenous variation in the road safety, we exploit the transition from public to private management in some but not all Brazilian states to provide both within- and between-states comparisons over time. We test whether these concessions, which are expected to promote more efficient road improvements and maintenance, can lead to road safety benefits by reducing number of road crashes and deaths. The analysis looks at various road safety outcomes including number of crashes per kilometer, number of deaths per crashes, number of vehicles involved in crashes, among others. A small number of studies that previously have addressed this question suggest that the road concessions through PPP could reduce the number of traffic crashes (Rangel et al., 2012; Rangel & Vassallo, 2015; Baumgarten & Middelkamp, 2015; Albalate & Bel-Pinãna, 2019). Nonetheless, these studies are largely focused on developed countries, even though most global road traffic deaths occur in the Global South (Abubakar et al., 2015). Moreover, the methods used in previous studies are largely based on negative binomial or panel regression models that do not capture causal effects (see section 2). This paper advances this literature by showing how a quasi-experimental research design can help estimate more robust evidence of the causal effect of road concessions on road safety outcomes. It also shows the importance of capturing how the effect of road concessions on road safety varies over time. Finally, this study brings new evidence on the relationship between road procurement and road safety using detailed data from a middle-income country with one of the largest road networks under private concessions in the world (Brochado & Vassallo, 2014; Neto et al., 2018).====The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on road safety and road concessions. Section 3 presents a brief context about road concessions in Brazil. Data and methods are presented in Section 4 and results presented in Section 5 Finally, Section 6 discusses the main conclusions about the case study of Brazil and some lessons that can be drawn for road safety performance more broadly.",Highway concessions and road safety:Evidence from Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000901,10 August 2021,2021,Research Article,101.0

This study seeks to improve upon existing fleet evolution work, by simulating the adoption of autonomous, electric, and shared vehicles in a single fleet evolution simulation, calibrated with results of a recent survey of Americans. Statistical models are used in the household-level microsimulation to model decisions regarding vehicle transactions, travel behavior, and land use decisions.====The simulation predicts a shift in the powertrain makeup of the United States fleet, with hybrid-electric and plug-in ==== each comprising over 40% of the private fleet by 2050. The rate of decline of the price premium for self-driving vehicle technology has a significant effect on autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption rates. Allowing the ability to retain a human-driving option in self-driving vehicles increases AV adoption rates by roughly 10% by 2050. Shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) use rises to roughly 35% of overall VMT by 2050, about one third of which is via dynamic ride-sharing (DRS). VMT among private vehicles roughly follows adoption rates, though technologies with greater adoption generally experience disproportionately higher VMT.","Many new travel options are emerging, including electric scooters, electrified buses, and very small aircraft (with vertical take-offs and landings). Among these new modes, self-driving or “autonomous”, electric, and shared vehicle technologies are poised for rapid growth. Very-short-term rentals in urban areas launched the relatively new concept of shared vehicles and can serve as an alternative to privately-owned vehicles. Ride-sharing en route (with strangers, as in Lyft Shared and Uber Pool) has emerged in the last few years, enabled by cell phones equipped with GPS technology. Fully self-driving vehicles, once they become available, will impact these options and others. They can be adopted with or without a human driving option and can be owned privately or shared by multiple users. If self-driving vehicles are shared, they can be dynamically shared among the users by matching them in real-time. Dynamic ride sharing (DRS) has become possible with smartphone applications and network technologies, while non-DRS represents traditional matching of users for car-pooling. When shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are combined with DRS, they can increase demand for motorized-vehicle trips and even undercut demand for public transit, bikes, and non-motorized modes (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2016).====Among various changes expected in the future, this research focused on the evolution of powertrain and adoption of autonomous vehicles. Among powertrains, the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) may increase because of their environmentally friendly features and lower energy cost. EVs can reduce emissions and negative health impacts in many power-generation settings, compared to conventional internal combustion vehicles. Reiter and Kockelman (2017) find a typical EV to generate about half the emissions externalities as that of a gasoline vehicle in Texas cities. Nichols et al. (2015) estimated EVs in Texas to lower emissions of every analyzed pollutant except SO₂, which increases due to the burning of coal for electricity generation. According to Noori et al. (2015), lower emissions of air pollutants can be achieved with EVs, since EVs have a lower environmental damage cost in the US for each air pollutant compared to combustion vehicles. EVs will lower emissions of all pollutants if generation is shifted away from coal and toward cleaner sources. Many national, state, and local governments have initiatives to accelerate EV adoption, seeking air quality, climate change, and energy-security benefits. As long as generation is sufficient to meet demand, revenues from EV charging may minimize electricity rate increases, while EV owners may be able to save money via overnight charging (Tonachel, 2017). Gallagher and Muehlegger (2007) expand this economic effect by arguing that government incentives and changing gasoline prices might affect the adoption of EVs and changes in powertrain.====Shared and autonomous vehicle technologies may also change the US fleet composition, since SAVs may alter vehicle ownership and demand for various transportation modes. Perrine and Kockelman (2017) indicated that autonomous vehicle (AV) travel may partially replace airline travel, while generating more short-distance travel. It stands to reason that intercity rail and bus modes may also be affected. Fagnant and Kockelman (2014) found that each shared autonomous vehicle may replace 11 personal vehicles but increase vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) by 10%, while decreasing overall emissions. If SAVs entice people to give up personal vehicles, the vehicle fleet may shrink, necessitating less parking space. Increased VMT of SAVs may drive higher vehicle production rates of SAVs, since they will accumulate miles quickly. Thus, the adoption of SAVs would derive different travel characteristics for US vehicle fleets in the future.",America’s fleet evolution in an automated future,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000792,22 July 2021,2021,Research Article,102.0

The well-known ,"Trip generation models play a crucial role in the structure of transport modelling frameworks. The classical 4-step transport modelling process includes trip generation as the first step replicating the overall demand for mobility followed by three other steps namely trip distribution, mode choice, and traffic assignment. The trip generation models provide a high-level picture of the travel demand. The breakdown of trips across different modes of transport and destinations is determined in the consecutive steps. This means, the performance of trip generation models highly affects the performance of the following steps (Badoe and Steuart, 1997), which leads to a major impact on the capacity of the model for assessment of policies and proposals. Transport planning is typically formed around policy appraisal tools which are responsible to identify and measure consequences of different polices and projects. An ideal policy appraisal tool should provide a holistic view of costs and benefits of different future scenarios. One of the main promises of transport projects is to improve welfare by facilitating movement within and between cities and, however the existing transport policy appraisal mechanisms are not designed to measure welfare. For instance, transport infrastructure projects such as railroads provide benefits such as decreasing trade costs and increasing income that are expected to lead to higher welfare (DONALDSON, 2018). Since income has an impact on travel demand (PAS, 1986), change of income affects trip generation and mobility pattern of people which consequently contribute to reformation of the transport system. However, the current transport project assessment mechanisms are focused on the improvement of level of service where the overall impact of policies on the society are overlooked. The most commonly used assessment tools are based on the classical cost-benefit analysis (CBA) method. This method imposes limitations as it assumes that market operates perfectly, which is therefore unable to capture the impact of externalities, imperfections, monopolistic firms, taxes and excess demand/supply. In addition, for large transport projects (compared to the economy) where the project impacts the whole economy including other markets, CBA fails to provide a realistic appraisal as it does not account for the linkage between transport projects and other markets (Prest and Turvey 1965) which might be significantly affected as employments might be created or lost.====Another appraisal tool that can be used to economically compare projects is the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. A CGE model considers the impact of a project on the entire economy by simulating supply and demand in markets using microeconomic functions for economic agents, including both households and ﬁrms. The economic agents interact through price mechanisms. Since the supply and demand of each market is a function of all prices in the economy, any change in a market can affect other markets as well. As a result, a CGE model is capable of capturing the interaction between different markets (ROBSON, 2018).====A CGE model can be used as an appraisal tool which considers the impact of the project in the whole economy without the limitation of CBA such as the incapability to evaluate the eventual distribution of benefits among economic agents (Bröcker et al., 2010). A trip generation model is one of the important components of the transport planning framework is expected to be an integral part of the CGE tools to better capture the consequences of transport projects. In this structure, the travel demand is modelled using a trip generation model which then informs the CGE model about the number of trips being generated to and from different industries and between origins and destinations for passenger trips. In previous studies with zone-based travel demand modelling approaches, static pre-estimated factors (rates of generated trips per worked hour estimated from survey data) have been used to exogenously account for trip rates (ROBSON & DIXIT, 2017). Using static factors for trip generation imposes limitations including, but not limited to, the model being unable to capture the impacts of socio-economic attributes of agents as they change given different equilibria obtained from the CGE model. Such attributes such as age (Calvo et al., 2019), industry type (JANG, 2005), income (PAS, 1986), are known to affect the trip generation patterns. This should clarify the importance of having a communication channel between the transport model, in this case the trip generation model, and the appraisal tool, in this case the CGE framework.====This study contributes to the literature by introducing an endogenous trip generation model integrated into the CGE model which enables the CGE structure to directly reflect changes in the socio-economic attributes of agents in the trip generation model. The introduction of an endogenous trip generation model to the CGE-transport integrated model allows the trips to become sensitive to the economic variations determined by the CGE model, and the other way around. This better aligns the proposed CGE structure with the classical 4-step modelling framework which contributes to the introduction of CGE-based travel demand models like an ABM-CGE model. This paper presents the first step of a research direction to fully integrate the 4-step modelling structure into a CGE model where trip rates are not ==== estimated using household travel survey data, but instead are sensitive to economic and demographic attributes while iteratively communicating with the CGE model.====This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the literature of trip generations models and appraisal tools for transport projects are reviewed, and the identified research gaps are discussed. Section 3 first introduces the development of the household travel demand dataset used in this study. In the second part of Section 3, the trip generation model is presented. In Sections 4 the application of developed model on two case studies is investigated.

In this dynamic environment, the mobility of people and goods represents a key element of urban life, determining economic advantages, while also generating high social costs (e.g. pollution, congestion). Transport policies usually aim at improving citizens' quality of life, by focusing on increasing the level of service of the transport system and reducing its negative externalities (Banister, 2008). Nevertheless, especially in cities with a strong touristic vocation, policies should also consider the specific needs of tourists (Hall, 1999). Their general experience correlates to the fruition of the city's transport system. In this respect, tourism and transport are strictly interwoven and reciprocally affect one another. From one side, the touristic experience of a city is strictly related to the fruition of its transport system whereas from the other, especially in cities with a strong touristic vocation, touristic flows affect the urban transport system, thus requiring appropriate transport policies to satisfy also these specific needs.====Encouraging the use of active transport modes for tourists, e.g. walking or cycling, is one of the best strategies to foster sustainable mobility and tourism (Page, 2004). Besides, they usually represent the last mile of any trips tourists perform. Their walking experience is very important to determine their satisfaction level with respect to the touristic destination. Nevertheless, this has rarely been considered in research and, even less, in planning. In this respect, Hall and Ram (2019) acknowledge that walking is one of the most common activities tourists undertake when travelling, but it is also one of the less investigated activities when it comes to tourism research.====This paper scrutinises tourists' preferences in Rome (Italy), with respect to the “last mile” of their transport experience which usually takes place by walking.

Most railways in Africa, built in the colonial period and then managed by state owned companies, experienced poor performances and deteriorated since independence. From the end of the last century, ==== and traditional donors promoted private concessions in the railway sector, but results were generally below expectations. Based on project level data about official financial flows from the World Bank and from China, the study shows that China is now a main foreign ==== provider for the railway systems in Africa. Through panel data regressions on flows at country leveland considering the determinants of funding, we find that financial allocation by China does not seem to be biased in favour of public or private management, nor to favour countries supported by the World Bank before the privatization phase. The needs of recipient countries seem to shape the allocation of funds by China, but also commercial interests play a role in this allocation. Overall funding from China seems to complement World Bank funding in the effort to fill the financing gap of the sector.","Official flows from China to Africa have been growing in the recent decades, making China a main finance provider for many African countries, particularly for the infrastructure sectors, where the amounts provided by China closely compare with those of all traditional donors taken together. Within the transport industry in 2009, railway was the first sector by value of the projects financed by China in Africa, and the second one, preceded only by the energy sector, when all infrastructural projects are considered, (Foster et al., 2009). African infrastructures have long been recognized to suffer from a huge financing gap, that domestic governments, bilateral and multilateral donors and private investors have been struggling to fill over years. For railways particularly, long-term maintenance neglect was estimated to have caused as of 2010 a backlog investment of up to $3 billion, before considering new projects (Foster and Briceño-Garmendia, 2010). Since the emergence of China as a main provider of official finance==== in Africa at the turn of the millennium, a vibrant debate on the interests and motivations behind its engagement in the continent has emerged (Naim, 2007; Kaplinsky et al., 2007; Bräutigam, 2011; Eisenmann, 2012; Dreher and Fuchs, 2015; Broich, 2017) and coordination with traditional donors has proved to be challenging (Bräutigam, 2009; Humphrey and Michaelowa, 2019; Zeitz, 2020). The study aims at exploring the determinants of Chinese funding for African railways, also considering the financial efforts by traditional donors in the same sector.====Railways in Africa, such as most other infrastructure, were first set up by colonial powers, that were driven by economic and political interests. Rail transport initially was preferred to road transport and, jointly with ports, attracted huge investments, for its capacity to carry for long distances large quantities of heavy, bulky and low value-added commodities, like agricultural products and minerals. However, roads soon became more competitive, especially for passenger services and for all the time-sensitive goods. In fact, African railways were not designed to ensure speed and have high fixed costs, rarely under 70 percent of total costs, including capital and maintenance costs (Olievschi, 2013). Low traffic flows make the railway transport less efficient and more expensive compared to road transport. Average traffic density in Sub-Saharan African railways in 2010 was less than 1 million traffic units per rail-route-km, a very poor value, while the situation was better in North Africa (Olievschi, 2013). Since independence of African nations and until the ‘90s, almost all African railways were publicly owned and operated, but they often failed to recover costs, and became burdensome for public finance. Despite support by international donors, maintenance tended to be poor, while rehabilitation and new investment works stalled. By 1990 most of the sub-Saharan African railways were in virtual bankruptcy and needed large investments in infrastructure and rolling stock.====From the ‘90s, in line with the prevailing market orientation of policies, many concession contracts were signed, with governments remaining as the owner of infrastructure and transferring rolling stock, operation and maintenance of the railway to a concessionaire.==== This was often promoted and financed by bilateral and multilateral organizations, which, in a period of increasing focus on sector reform rather than infrastructure investment (McKinnon, 2010),==== blamed government inefficiencies and raised expectations on private sector performances (Bullock, 2009). Observers agree that results were at best mixed while there is no consensus in literature about the interpretation of the trends in the financial support to African railways from the World Bank and on the responsibility of traditional international donors in the neglect of the sector (Olievschi, 2013; Amadou et al., 2015).====This study analyses trends in the railway sector financing by the World Bank from the ‘70s and proposes a comparison for the period 2000–2014 between funding from China and from the World Bank. Moreover, we model financial flows from China to the railway sector in the period 2000–2014, to test the effect of different variables which might motivate its support to African countries in this sector, including, among regressors current and past funding by the World Bank. Our results contribute to the scientific debate on the presence of China as a new finance provider in Africa and to the one on infrastructural financing gap.====The analysis is based on data on official flows retrieved from two databases: World Bank operations dataset, which provides basic information on all the World Bank's projects; AidData dataset, which records the overseas official finance from China between 2000 and 2014 and it is based on an open-source methodology. The ultimate objective of the study is to shed light on the drivers of official funding allocation by China to the railway sector of African countries, including if there is a relationship between World Bank funding allocation and allocation of funding by China. By analysing competition and complementarity dynamics, the study contributes to the debate on financing gaps for African infrastructures.====The study shows that China now represents the largest provider of official finance for African railway infrastructures. Between 2000 and 2014 China committed more than ten times the amount provided by the World Bank to the same sector in this period. African railway infrastructure seems to be not a priority sector for the World Bank in the period considered, possibly due to mixed results of the Bank's railway sector reform strategy and persisting challenges in financial sustainability of the systems. Funding from China seems to be explained by its commercial interests, by the actual need of the recipient countries, as captured by income per capita, and by the level of assistance received from the World Bank. We argue that China contributes to fill the funding gap left by the relative withdrawal of traditional donors from the sector, supporting the renewed interest of African governments and institutions in railways.====This paper is organized as follows.

Prioritization of such projects over a multi-period planning horizon (under a limited budget) is a difficult task, as it is usually formulated as a bilevel network design problem (NDP). Although multi-period network investment is studied in the literature, its application by public agencies is limited because of the complexities involved in network design problems and the computational time needed to analyze large scale networks (i.e., performing the traffic assignment at the lower level of the NDP). The contribution of this research is two-fold. First, it extends a previously published single year discrete network design formulation to a multi-period discrete network design problem (MPNDP) to capture both the spatial and temporal patterns of multi-period network investment decisions. Second, using the MPNDP investment results; and the network characteristics, this research develops and evaluates a new ==== model the Multi-Period Econometric Network Investment Model (MENIM). MENIM can be used by agencies in place of MPNDP to approximate network investments.

Patterns of multi-period network investments from these numerical experiments are also extensively discussed along with policy recommendations for public agencies.","Decision for roadway transportation network investments either for improvement (capacity or operational) or maintenance are needed on a regular basis to ensure that travel demand is satisfied within acceptable congestion levels and safety. Planning for such improvements requires a strategic approach that considers budget availability and policy limitations over a period of multiple years, while at the same time accounting for network utilization changes by the users (due to the investment, land use changes, and population growth). Even though developing and adopting a multi-period network improvements plan is a preferred strategy, when compared to single year planning, the literature suggests that multi-period network investment research is limited (Ukkusuri & Patil, 2009; Wei & Schonfeld, 1994).====The roadway transportation network investment problem is typically formulated as a network design problem (NDP see Johnson et al., 1978). Depending on the definition of the decision variables the NDP can be classified as: (i) continuous or CNDP (Suwansirikul et al., 1987), (ii) discrete or DNDP (Chang & Chang, 1993; Farvaresh & Sepehri, 2012; Haas & Bekhor, 2016; Lou et al., 2009; Mishra et al. 2014a, 2015; Miandoabchi & Farahani, 2011; Wang et al, 2013, 2015; Welch & Mishra, 2014a), or (iii) mixed (MNDP) network design problem (Yang & Bell, 1998). NDP is typically formulated as a bi-level problem where: (i) the upper-level problem determines the network improvements decision, and (ii) the lower-level problem determines the travel pattern of the network users. This bi-level structure and computational complexity of the lower-level result in the NDP being one of the most challenging problems in transportation investment (Allende & Still, 2012; Chen & Chen, 2013; Colson et al., 2005; Fontaine & Minner, 2014; Zhang & Gao, 2009).====Formulating the NDP is easy but solving it is computationally challenging. As a result, public agencies seldom use it as a decision-making tool while at the same time limited literature has been published for cases of medium to large-scale transportation networks with single- or multi-period planning (Mathew & Sharma, 2009; Wei & Schonfeld, 1994). To address these issues, this research proposes an alternative approach and has the following contributions. First, we extend the single year NDP approach proposed by Wang et al. (2013) to a multi-period NDP (MPNDP) and present patterns of network investment (i.e., network size, planning period, budget, and demand) for several test and real-world networks. Second, we develop, calibrate, and evaluate a Multi-Period Econometric Network Investment Model (MENIM) that can be used as a surrogate to the NDP with comparable accuracy but slightly higher computational efficiency.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A summary of the published literature on DNDP and MPNDP is presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents the methodology for MPNDP. Section 4 discusses the results from an application of MPNDP and their effects on policy analysis. The fifth section presents the econometric framework, calibration, and validation of the MENIM model.

There are several motivations for this choice, among which one may recall its:====Indeed, the food supply chain has recently changed a lot (====). Firstly, many traditional grocery retailers started to utilize their existing distribution network for delivering grocery, ordered online, directly to the customers'places (====). Furthermore, online supermarkets (without physical stores) fulfill home deliveries directly from their warehouses (====). Lastly, also internet-based pure player retailers entered the market with their own online grocery shops (====).====Focusing specifically on the logistics aspects, which largely affect the quality of the service (====) and the consequent channel choice (====), there are two main last mile delivery solutions: “home delivery” (HD), i.e. a direct home (or workplace) delivery from either warehouses or stores, and “click and pick/collect” (C&P), when customers can collect products in stores or at specific pickup points (====; ====). The first remains the current dominant e-grocery distribution model (====; ====; ====), despite it requires the attendance of the customer at the moment of delivery (====), due to the perishability and storage condition-sensitivity of fresh and frozen items; for the same reason, boxes at specific pickup points seem not very reliable (====).====Nonetheless, despite its importance for both consumers and retailers, and its diffusion,====). Consumer preferences for delivery attributes in online retailing had only received limited attention in the literature (====), as well as their dependence on product or consumer characteristics (====). In order to fill these gaps, ==== analyse the grocery market in Shanghai (China), where not only product price, but also service cost and product range might affect the consumer's channel choice.====In this paper, a similar study is conducted and applied to the case of Italy, focusing on two major cities, i.e. Rome and Milan. A stated preference survey is performed, where respondents are asked to describe their Grocery Shopping (GS) habits and to choose among different options and delivery characteristics. A Multinomial Logit model is estimated and preference heterogeneity investigated ==== segmenting the sample (====), which is not very common in logistics literature (====).====To the best of the authors' knowledge, no similar studies have been conducted to understand Italian consumers' preferences for different grocery strategies. Under this respect, Italy is an interesting case study: its share of e-buyers in 2019 was one of the lowest in Europe (38%, compared to the EU-28 average 63% based on ====) and specifically, out of these, the Italian individuals buying food and groceries online are only 13% (EU-28 average 27%), i.e. 5% of the whole population (EU-28 average 17%). However, even if Italian consumers seemed not very attracted by online GS, this niche is growing, in terms not only of individuals, but also of frequency and value of the purchased goods (====). This can be ascribable to an increasing service coverage, to the spread of Internet, to innovative and flexible innovations, such as C&P or drive in, which reduce delivery costs and waiting times (====), and to an improved information on product availability. For this reason, results of the demand analysis could be useful to shape the service according to user preferences and trying to prevent negative consequences of e-grocery.====The paper includes six sections.

A ==== survey was performed in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, using the following attributes: lead time, order fill rate and delivery-service price. Age and gender of interviewees were also considered in this decision-making process. The sample was composed of 222 interviewees. Mixed Logit models and Decision Trees were used to analyze the data and their interactions. Order Fill Rate was found to be the most important attribute. Failure to satisfactorily fulfill the order at the moment of shopping can significantly compromise e-groceries. Some interactions among the variables, such as between order fill rate and delivery-service price, have also led to interesting conclusions that should be taken into account by the grocer when planning special offers. Short lead times do not seem to be a very important priority for regular e-grocery purchasing. This research approach combines two statistical methods to better understand consumer behavior concerning e-grocery, in addition to providing insights for grocery retailers on the importance of some attributes for the effectiveness of e-grocery and their consequences on business logistics, which are particularly challenging during pandemics.","The use of the Internet and smartphones between companies and people (B2C) for commercial purposes has been growing rapidly around the world as customers feel more confident in relation to correctly receiving the intended product and about the payment transaction. For those products already known and frequently purchased, such as a lot of groceries,==== this process tends to be intensified. It is likely to represent significant money and time savings for the customers, which could be used to carry out other more interesting activities than going personally to the stores, picking products, standing in the checkout queue and carrying heavy bags. In addition, e-grocery is particularly helpful for people with certain physical and mental disabilities that prevent them from going to the stores.====However, especially for e-grocery and home delivery, logistics is a challenge. On one hand, companies need to handle large product variety and inventory to fulfill most of the orders and get the products to the consumers, preferably allocating deliveries into truck routes. The presence of perishables and frozen food in the order demands extra requirements, such as temperature control. Special care should be taken by companies when selecting and dealing with certain products such as fruits and vegetables. Customers expect to receive these foods in good condition, the same that would be obtained if they went to the store and could see, touch and smell them to determine the freshness or appropriateness of the product. Regarding delivery, normally customers are not willing to wait the whole day or even a significant amount of time to receive the products at home. Saskia et al. (2016), when comparing the rise of e-grocery in France and Germany since 2012, identified several innovative concepts to deal with e-groceries, such as products ordered online then collected in store via chilled lockers (click and collect) instead of home delivering, and direct selling of goods from the wholesalers to the consumer, as they can provide better assortments than the retailer. These and other concepts primarily aim at appealing to customers, but some of them contribute to mitigating logistics issues as well.====On the other hand, the profit margin for grocery products in general is relatively low if compared to other products. This, together with the additional logistics costs of home delivery, require the companies to sell a reasonable amount of groceries in a single purchase to each customer in order to make this business profitable.====Regarding environmental impacts to the city, Comi and Nuzzolo (2016) developed a modelling framework that can be used to forecast shopping flows in city logistics scenarios, including shopping mobility, shop restocking mobility and e-purchase delivering mobility, under future demographic and socioeconomic changes in an urban area.====The purpose of the present research is to investigate the importance of considering certain attributes (order fill rate, lead time and delivery-service price) that both strongly impact logistics requirements and influence consumer decision-making in choosing to buy groceries from brick-and-mortar==== stores (in-store shopping) or receiving them at home through online shopping. We estimated the likelihood of choosing between these two alternatives, according to certain choice tasks, having the Greater Belo Horizonte, Brazil as the study area. In addition to the attributes of e-groceries service, some characteristics of the customer, such as age and gender were considered in order to determine whether or not the service should be addressed in specific market niches.====This paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a review of the literature focusing on the determinants of e-grocery and on the reasons for the attributes chosen for the modelling presented in this study; section 3 describes the data collected from a Stated Preference survey; section 4 presents the methodological approach, including two complementary modelling, used to evaluate the importance of the attributes and their interactions on the alternatives (brick-and-mortar and online shopping); section 5 reports the obtained results.

Indeed, underdeveloped transport infrastructures may limit growth by increasing transportation costs, thus constraining trade (both within country as well as with foreign trade partners) and thereby limiting the exploitation of both scale and agglomeration economies, the division of labor, the efficient matching of employers and employees, the intensity of competition and the associated firm dynamics, the diffusion of knowledge and, more generally, the development of the full potential of the internal market.====While the early literature on the economic effects of public and transportation infrastructure capital had a clear macroeconomic flavor,==== more recently, in the regional science and economics literature==== there has been a surge of studies that have sought to evaluate the impact of different transportation networks on various economic outcomes using rigorous counterfactual impact evaluation methods in a regional setting.==== Interestingly, with the exception of China, the empirical evidence on middle-income and developing countries is still scant.==== In this respect, Brazil is an interesting case study since it is a middle-income country that grew reasonably fast in the 2000s, while barely grew over the period 2010–2017. Some authors (e.g. Goes et al. (2018); Raiser et al. (2017)) have blamed its recent disappointing performance to various bottlenecks that characterize Brazil's transport infrastructures. Indeed, the logistic system ranks poorly (Goes et al., 2018) and, in particular, the road network - that accounts for the movement of about 60% of goods in Brazil - still largely relies on the infrastructure investments realized in the 1960s and 1970s.==== Recently, some increases in the rate of infrastructure investment in the road network have been realized, possibly as a result of the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) infrastructure program (Amann et al. (2016)).==== However, investment rates still lag behind the minimum required levels necessary to cover depreciation (Raiser et al., 2017); as a consequence, the road network is relatively underdeveloped and with a large fraction of unpaved roads.====In the light of the shortage of road infrastructure investments, of the low quality which characterizes the road network and the necessity to increase it in the near future, this is a timely moment to assess the impact of recent expansions in the road network that have occurred in Brazil, especially after the 2007 launch of the PAC program.====We conduct such analysis by studying the effect of road network expansions on value added for a panel of industries in Brazilian states observed over the period 2005-15 by using a differences-in-differences research design. In particular, we follow the approach originally proposed by Fernald (1999) in order to evaluate the effects of the construction of the US federal highways network and recently implemented by Li et al. (2017) for the Chinese highways. The identification assumption is that road network extensions in any given state are likely to display relatively stronger effects, if any, in those industries that tend to purchase transport services relatively more. Indeed, if roads expansions were unrelated to growth and a correlation with the latter emerged only via macroeconomic trends at the state level, data should not show a stronger correlation with value added in industries that rely on transport services more intensively. Therefore, in this identification framework, industries that, for technological reasons, tend to rely less on transportation services (e.g. because they move heavier goods that tend to be more “road intensive” (Duranton et al., 2014), or because their employees do not need to travel long distances for business trips) act as a sort of control group for the “treated” ones, i.e. those that rely more on transportation services.====The main result of our study is that road network extensions have been associated to larger increases in value added precisely in those industries that are more likely to display stronger reliance on transportation services. We find this result to be robust to various sensitivity checks; in particular, we verify that it holds even when we allow other state-level variables - possibly correlated with road network extension - to have a differential effect on value added in transportation intensive industries, such as other transport infrastructures (railways network, airports and ports) among the others. We also find that this effect tends to be larger in those states whose capital is located further away from an important seaport. This result suggests that the improvements in the road network might positively affect production by reducing the transportation costs that are necessary to reach an important port, which in turn favors the import and export activity.====Surprisingly, we also find that the quality of roads, proxied by the percentage of roads that are considered to be in good or excellent shape, does not have any independent effect on value added, once we control for road length. Finally, we find empirical evidence consistent with the existence of positive spillovers from road network extensions in nearby states. Such finding suggests that the effect that we uncover is more likely to be akin to a net effect, as opposed to a simple spatial reorganization of economic activity (Redding and Turner (2015)).====This study contributes to the previous literature on different dimensions. First, it provides new empirical evidence on the role played by road network extensions for the case of middle-income countries, which have received so far limited attention by the economics and regional science literature.==== Second, unlike previous studies that have identified the impact of the road network using either an event-study approach (exploiting the variation over time in the “arrival” of an highway or a railway in a given area) and/or instrumental variable techniques (e.g. Yu (2016); Lin (2017); Baum Snow et al. (2018); Faber (2014); Duranton et al. (2014)),==== we exploit the availability of sector level data in various states and use variation in the dependence on transportation services across industries (and states) in order to identify the causal effect on value added of increases in road network at state level, along the lines of Fernald (1999) and Li et al. (2017). Third, following the approach of Duranton and Turner (2012) and Agrawal et al. (2017), we add to the literature on the economic effects of transport infrastructure by providing evidence on the debate on the net effects versus the spatial reorganization of economic activity. Such debate, according to Redding and Turner (2015), is still one of the areas that warrants further research in the regional science field.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The ICEVs are the primary source of urban pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The alarming levels of urban pollution are putting enormous pressure on the Indian automobile industry to switch from ICEVs to zero emission vehicles such as electric vehicles (EVs). Even though the potential of EVs as a safe transportation alternative has been acknowledged and encouraged by Indian government, the commercialization of EVs has not received the desired success as of now. There are many hindrances to large-scale adoption of EVs such as high initial price, driving range anxiety, lack of proper charging infrastructure, and underdeveloped battery technology etc. This study aims to evaluate the conducive factors for EV adoption and completes in three phases. In the first phase, supporting forces to EV adoption in India are explored using political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) analysis, and capability needs for EV manufacturing business in India are identified in phase two using the people, process, technology, and ==== (PPTF) framework. Finally, segment analysis is performed to find out the most profitable segment to foray into the current situation.","The increasing number of automobile users globally has resulted in genuine ecological concerns like deterioration in air quality, ozone-layer exhaustion, and an unfavorable climatic change. Most of the automobiles in India and all across the world are primarily internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) which utilize petroleum fuel for propulsion. Additionally, this excessive use of petroleum fuel in vehicles is leading to gradual depletion of petroleum reserves across the globe. The growing natural concerns and exhausting petroleum derivatives have driven automobile producers to move their focus from ICEVs to electric vehicles (EVs) (Kumar, Nema, & Gupta, 2020). Besides, to enhance sustainability of the transportation ecosystem, it has become imperative to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollutants and dependence on petroleum fuel. In this regard, increasing the use of EVs has been recommended as a potential strategy to reduce fuel consumption as well as mitigate the harmful effects of GHG emissions with the aim to alleviate the reasons for unfavorable environmental change (Soltani-Sobh et al., 2017). This realization about the harmful effects of environmental pollution and diminishing natural resources along with the various incentive schemes instituted by governments across the world have led to a surge in the sales figures of EVs in the recent years.====EVs are gaining widespread popularity due to their zero tail pipe carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions; hence they provide a safer alternative for the realization of pollution free environment. Global EV Outlook, in its 2020 issue has reported that there were approximately 2.1 million electric car sales globally in 2019, thereby boosting the stock to 7.2 million electric cars. Electric cars, which accounted for 2.6% of global car sales and about 1% of global car stock in 2019, registered a 40% year-on-year increase. The surge in the popularity of EVs can be ascertained by the fact that EVs contributed around 54% of the total car sales in 2020 in Norway (Klesty, 2021). However, this surge in the demand of EVs has not been uniform globally. As of 2018, of all the EVs sold worldwide, China alone accounted for about 39%, whereas Europe and the United States contributed 24% and 22%, respectively (Global EV Outlook, 2019). India accounts for less than 1% electric four wheelers considering its overall car ownership (Rajper & Albrecht, 2020). This could be due to the higher initial price of EVs over ICEVs. Conversely, in terms of running cost per kilometer, EVs are around 80–85% cheaper than ICEVs considering the current electricity and petrol/diesel prices in India. Assuming a five-year running period, the total cost of the vehicle and the running cost of fuel are cheaper by approximately 20% in favor of EVs. Hence, the initial high price is negated by savings in the running cost over time (Pawar, 2020; Supriya, 2018).====With a huge potential market for EVs, interest in EV manufacturing is witnessing a steady increase. However, owing to the presence of different segments of automobiles in Indian market such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, transport vehicles etc., the obvious challenge for a manufacturing company is to make the correct choice of the most lucrative segment from among these segments. In view of the ensuing discussion, this study endeavors to serve the following research objectives (ROs):====RO1: What are the supporting forces of the EV industry in India from the lens of political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) analysis?====RO2: What are the capability needs for the EV manufacturing business in India from the people, process, technology, and finance (PPTF) perspective?====RO3: Which is the most profitable segment to venture into in the current Indian scenario based on various financial ratios?====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

It also discusses some of the policy initiatives taken by the Indian government for a smooth transition to EVs. Section 3 explores and reviews the extant literature pertaining to EVs.

In order to optimise the timing and size of such projects, the literature has indicated that ==== (RO) are better suited than the more traditional net present value (NPV) approach. The models are very theoretical and difficult to implement in practice. The objective of this paper is to extend the empirical RO literature in transportation and logistics by bringing continuous-time continuous-state RO models closer to practitioners. This is done by means of developing a blueprint for a practical software application through which port investment managers can easily calculate their optimal decisions. Additionally, the blueprint of this practical implementation allows for a better understanding of the continuous RO logic and way of working. As the discussion of the RO advantages shows, optimising the decision through continuous RO models, rather than applying NPV, can allow ports to realise a much better investment and generate a lot more value from port investment projects. Nevertheless, depending on the specific situation, practitioners might require supplementary assistance of econometricians or consultants to estimate the RO model input parameters. This paper also adds to the literature by quantifying these potential gains and costs.","Good logistics performance of ports exhibits two important characteristics, namely low logistics costs and high reliability of the operations (Munim & Schramm, 2018). In order to perform port operations effectively and efficiently and generate added value in a port, investing to build new or expand existing ports is crucial. A port's ability to provide cargo throughput services is quantified in terms of its capacity. Next to building new capacity-increasing elements, capacity can also be increased through the optimisation of existing terminals (ESCAP, 2002; Kauppila, Martinez, Merk, & Benezec, 2016). Each of these investment types will allow generating more throughput at better service levels (Musso et al., 2006). Since port capacity installed by investors increases the service level of the operators, the generalised cost in the logistics chain will fall, and also shippers and consumers will experience benefits from these investments (Talley et al., 2014). Musso et al. (2006) refer to this concept as a port investment chain.====Having insufficient service capacity to handle cargo could cause congestion, leading to increased logistics costs (Novaes et al., 2012). In a port, a service environment, and in transportation in general, it is even more important than in a production environment to have the right amount of capacity, since the transportation service is not storable (de Weille & Ray, 1974). Capacity that is not used at the actual time period cannot be stored and used in the next, as opposed to warehoused goods. Undercapacity cannot be covered either by unused outputs from a previous period. Since the demand for cargo throughput is uncertain and variability may become high, it might occur that moments of empty berths are followed by moments in which ships are waiting to be serviced at a berth that is currently occupied. In this way, congestion and waiting time might start to build up in the port at occupancy rates of about 50% of the theoretical design capacity, the maximum amount of throughput that can be handled by a port in a certain time period. Above an occupancy rate of 75%–80%, waiting times increase more than linearly (Blauwens, De Baere, & Van de Voorde, 2016; Kauppila, Martinez, Merk, & Benezec, 2016; Leachman & Jula, 2011).====A mismatch between demand and capacity can result in periods of capacity scarcity or overcapacity. Without sufficient capacity, i.e., undercapacity, the port risks losing customers, throughput and profit due to the congestion building up. This results in a loss of social welfare in the form of lost consumer surplus. However, installing capacity comes at an investment cost, positively related to the amount of installed capacity. As a result, installing too much capacity, i.e., overcapacity, poses a problem as well, as money is invested in capacity that is not used and that hence does not generate revenues. This gives rise to a trade-off between investing too much money in unused capacity and investing in too little capacity, which leads to higher user waiting costs and which might eventually lead to losing customers and profit (Meersman & Van de Voorde, 2014a). This capacity investment trade-off is even more complicated by the uncertainty in the port (Musso et al., 2006). As a result, installing the right amount of capacity at the right moment is crucial (Vanelslander, 2014).====In practice, the traditional net present value (NPV) approach based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is often used to evaluate port investment projects, because practitioners, managers and decision makers find it easier to model and explain (Pimentel, Couto, Tavares, & Oliveira, 2020). However, this traditional approach neglects the value of flexible options in irreversible projects and uncertainty, such as the option to delay investment. Even if uncertainty is low or absent, the NPV decision rule can be (very) wrong, because the irreversible investment decision is considered as a now-or-never decision (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). Oppositely, real options (RO) models offer a more appropriate method to evaluate flexible investments under uncertainty and make better investment decisions, especially in case of large, very costly, irreversible and uncertain projects with long construction lead times, such as port infrastructure investments. Initially, the RO theory has been elaborated by Dixit and Pindyck (1994), Trigeorgis (1993) and Trigeorgis (1996). RO models monetarily quantify the value of managerial flexibility to react to uncertainty in the best possible way. Only when all relevant options of flexibility are included in the project appraisal, the investment decision can be valued correctly. To this end, RO models use stochastic calculus and dynamic programming to optimise an objective function (such as the value of the firm), including a random term related to an investment decision variable (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). It is however important to point out that RO models should not necessarily be seen as a replacement for NPV with discounted cash flows. It is complementary to it, because the value of a project can be calculated as the static NPV plus the value of the real options present (Hu & Zhang, 2015; Van Putten & MacMillan, 2004).====The majority of the RO models developed in the academic literature are theoretical models. They allow deriving theoretical insights into the optimal investment decision under uncertainty. Mathews et al. (2007) advocated more than 10 years ago that RO models are often too complex to implement, due to the difficulty to derive realistic parameters that are needed as input for these models. Since this statement, little has changed for continuous-time continuous-state RO models. Some authors however propose useful applications of discrete-time discrete-state RO models to real-life cases in transportation environments. For instance, Pimentel et al. (2018) apply RO to an investment in high-speed rail, whereas Oliveira, Couto, & Pimentel, 2020 consider the expansion of Ponta Delgada airport as an RO application. RO have also been applied to investments in airlines (Hu et al., 2019) and container shipping capacity under uncertainty (Haehl & Spinler, 2018; Rau & Spinler, 2016, 2017). A nice case study containing an application of RO to the expansion of an existing port, is given by Pimentel, Couto, Tavares, & Oliveira, 2020. They confirm that the RO value is the sum of the static NPV and the option value of flexibility under uncertainty. Another interesting example is provided by Martins et al. (2017), who consider port expansion options of a given size (expressed in TEU) and given timing (when the existing capacity has an occupancy rate of 80%), as American-style call options, without taking congestion costs into account. However, since these discrete-time discrete-state models only consider a limited number of (discrete) states and involve Monte Carlo simulations, not all possible investment scenarios are considered by the model in the analysis.====Notwithstanding the large number of applications of discrete-time discrete-state RO models involving binomial trees, Pimentel, Couto, Tavares, & Oliveira, 2020 argue that these models are not sufficiently accurate for complex project evaluation under uncertainty. Moreover, Martins et al. (2017) advocate for a maximal inclusion of flexibility in projects. This is exactly what continuous-time continuous-state RO models do, overcoming some shortcomings of binomial tree models. These continuous-time continuous-state RO models allow to optimise complex port investment decisions under uncertainty with respect to the decision variables that are considered, as an infinite number of possible investment strategies are considered. Balliauw (2020) for example considers the timing and size of a container port expansion as flexible decision variables that need to be optimised, modelling demand uncertainty using a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). His theoretical model shows the management of a port with a single actor that, if demand starts to grow stronger, they are better off by delaying port expansion and investing in more capacity once they invest. In addition, the characteristics of the economic environment, the port type and the investment project type have an influence on the optimal port capacity investment decision as well. The theoretical directions of these influences provide useful information for port managers at the moment when the economic environment changes. However, a practical application of such continuous RO models is still lacking. This would be very useful, since an infinite number of scenarios can be considered, each with a different size and timing of the investment, and the best one can be chosen in the end.====In order to apply continuous RO port models in practice, two conditions need to be fulfilled. On the one hand, the port management needs to have the information at hand to derive and estimate the values of the model parameters. On the other hand, the user needs to be able to apply advanced econometric methods in order to calculate the optimal investment timing and size, possibly supported by external econometricians (Dikos, 2008). This latter condition is less straightforward, as Marmer and Slade (2018) illustrate. They use the model of Bar-Ilan and Strange (1996) with time to build and apply it to the U.S. copper mining industry using advanced econometrics on reduced forms of a set of theoretical equations.====The question however remains: “How can a specific port implement continuous-time continuous-state RO models to derive its own optimal investment decision in reality?” A subsequent question that arises is: “What are the potential gains and costs of implementing RO, compared with currently-used decision making methods.” Therefore, the objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to develop a practical application of continuous-time continuous-state RO models for port investments, to make the gap between theory and practice smaller, and (2) to quantify potential monetary gains from actually using real options models for decision making, compared to NPV, in order to convince port managers to use RO models to improve their decisions. Both objectives are crucial empirical extensions of the existing RO literature in transportation and logistics, in order to allow practitioners to use the theoretically derived insights from continuous-time continuous-state RO models in practice and improve their investment decisions. The intended extension will also allow considering as much flexibility as possible in projects, due to the possibility to select the optimum from many more considered scenarios, compared to NPV and discrete RO models. Moreover, the complex RO model will be moved to run in the back end of the application, whereas the front end will only require relatively easy-to-determine inputs from practitioners. Although the application in this paper considers a seaport, the insights and approach can be used in other transportation settings too.====To respond to both research questions in this paper, the necessary information that serves as the input for the RO models is discussed, as well as a possible, basic programming approach to transform the model into an optimal real-life port investment decision. The required steps that are needed to move from the complex, theoretical RO models available in the literature to a more applicable, user-friendly implementation are discussed. These steps are gathered in a blueprint for a practical tool that can help to come one step closer to the practical implementation of the developed models, since the complex calculations are left for the algorithm. Hence, this tool should be seen as a simplified approach to yield a first approximation of the optimal investment strategy for a port expansion project, based on existing continuous-time continuous-state RO models. This tool could also support transforming the port management's input into the model parameters. Nevertheless, the quality of the input, such as the complex estimates of economic characteristics such as demand growth and uncertainty, will always be important and are left for the human user. Using the entered parameters, the RO model yields an approximation of the optimal investment size and timing in terms of observable, meaningful decision variables. It is however not the objective of this paper to explore the large number of complex estimation techniques for the parameters. These are nonetheless required to accurately implement the RO port models available in the literature. More advanced econometrics and further model extensions (e.g., including phased investment) will be crucial objects of further research to support decision makers and increase the realism and the applicability of RO investment analysis in ports. As for every model, also for this tool the wisdom “Rubbish in, rubbish out” holds.====In order to illustrate the proposed tool, the specific model of Balliauw (2020) has been chosen, because the majority of port capacity investment decisions are expansion decisions (De Langen, Turró, Fontanet, & Caballé, 2018) and involve considerable time to build (Kauppila, Martinez, Merk, & Benezec, 2016; Vanelslander, 2014). Moreover, ports can be owned privately or publicly, which has a specific impact on investments under uncertainty (Li & Cai, 2017). Both types are accounted for in this model. However, the hypothetical case study in this paper, to which the tool is applied, involves a private port expansion. According to Mort et al. (2002), a case study should contain a problem with real or hypothetical set-ups, involving real-life complexities. Since it was not possible to find a complete dataset of an existing port expansion scenario in this study, a hypothetical port expansion project with realistic data, from the Hamburg - Le Havre port range, and assumptions has been considered. Although the model of Balliauw (2020) does not explicitly model port competition, it is still useful to gain insight into the unrestricted optimal investment decision of a single port and to illustrate the model implementation in practice. To take into account the competition of nearby ports, the insights and different strategies of Ishii et al. (2013), who however did not take the endogenous timing decision into account, and Balliauw, Kort, and Zhang (2019) need to be considered afterwards. Subsequently, the aggregate optimal investment decision (valid for a service port model as is used in this paper) might need translation into the decision of multiple actors that are present in a port which is organised as a landlord port. This requires insight into the revenue and cost structures of the port authority (PA) and the terminal operating company (TOC) in order to derive their shares (the α′s of Balliauw et al. (2020)) in the total revenue and costs generated in the port.====This paper is structured as follows. The next section summarises the real options model that is used for the application developed in this paper. Section 3 discusses the blueprint of the practical tool to implement a simplified version of the developed continuous RO models for port managers to get a first idea about their optimal investment decision. Subsequently, Section 4 provides a reflection on the advantages and difficulties of using RO in a port context. These advantages are discussed and quantified for the hypothetical case studied in this paper. The final section provides the conclusion and potential extensions of the tool, based on future research outcomes.","From theoretical real options models to pragmatic decision making: Required steps, opportunities and threats",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000354,31 March 2021,2021,Research Article,112.0

As such, low-income identities are more likely to walk, frequently in parts of the city where walking infrastructure is minimal (if at all), and may therefore find it more difficult to exercise their RTTC than their high-income counterparts. To challenge the status quo, this study concludes that more ‘hubs’ of opportunity must be created to make walking more equitable in addition to improving the most urgent infrastructural shortages.","In the light of global climate pressures, rapid urbanisation and widening income inequalities, cities around the world have the responsibility to develop inclusively and sustainably. Examples from Europe point at viable transitions from car-oriented trajectories to people-centred development as public transport, bicycles and walking are favoured in city planning policies (Jones, 2016; Pucher & Dijkstra, 2003). Such transitions have been suggested by recent research as possible in cities of the global south at a comparatively earlier stage in private motorisation uptake and a modal share marked by use of public and non-motorised transport (T-SUM, 2020). In African cities, governments are tasked with the challenge of addressing such redefinition of urban development trajectories towards sustainable urban mobility while addressing pressing challenges at all scales, such as extreme poverty, unequal access to material infrastructures and essential opportunities, limited resources for public investment, and corruption. In this context, it comes as no surprise that even the most prosperous cities on the continent, including Cape Town, Johannesburg and Accra, are still overwhelmingly car-centric.====Studies and experience from walkable cities have shown that improved walkability correlates with narrowed income disparities, better air quality and improved road safety (e.g. Adkins, Dill, Luhr, & Neal, 2012). Barcelona's ‘superblocks’ are one example of a more pedestrian-friendly urban environment, benefitting from reduced death rates from road accidents and improved air quality (Bausells, 2016). As a mode available to all able-bodied citizens of all income groups, walking is potentially the most equitable means of transport (Forsyth & Southworth, 2008). Walkability, the extent to which the built environment encourages walking trips both as a principal mode of travel and for leisure, entails the reconfiguration of the urban form to the spatial requirements of a person, thus establishing equitable walking distances for all members of society (Said, Abou Zeid, & Kaysi, 2017). This essentially remedies the spatial mismatch of opportunities endemic in cities of the global south by promoting mixed land-use and polycentrism. Alas, in much of the global South walking is associated with poverty, and many citizens aspire to own a car (Porter, 2002).====This research challenges this misconception, drawing from conceptual development and empirical evidence not often explored in African cities. Building on the premises of transport equity, urban mobility and the production of pedestrian space, this study aims to explore pedestrians' (im)mobility as a way of unravelling deeper-rooted issues of inequity in developing cities. Borrowing Lefebvre's concept of the ==== (RTTC) – that citizens have rights to the resources of the city as well the collective right to change it (Harvey, 2008) – this study investigates the influence of transport infrastructure on pedestrian behaviours and how different members of society access daily opportunities and experience the city. Our analyses are structured under an analytical framework that considers, individual, physical and social determinants of walking as an exercise of the RTTC, reflecting on the structural drivers of walking inequalities across income groups. Set in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, the study seeks to understand the need to improve pedestrian space in the city, and to consider the bargaining power of different groups of citizens in shaping the urban form. By taking this perspective of the RTTC – adding to it the potential of walking – the study also makes a methodological contribution to the existing literature as discussed in section 3.====Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries, with extensive social and economic disparities manifest in a Human Development Index ranked 180th out of 188 countries, and 70% of the population living below the poverty line (World Bank, 2017). These inequalities exist microcosmically in Maputo, where spatial segregation was used to keep the Portuguese and ‘native’ Africans apart during colonialism (Newitt, 1995), with the Europeans creating their own ‘==== (Cement City), and the Mozambicans living in the peripheries known previously as the ‘==== (Cane City) as references to the construction materials of buildings in each part of the city. These spatial distinctions persist, with the minority affluent population inhabiting the Cement City, whilst low-income groups are confined to rudimentary housing in what are now referred to as the ‘====. In order to access jobs, schools and healthcare, the vast majority of ==== must embark on long, strenuous and unsafe daily commutes made predominantly on a combination of semi-formal “==== minibuses, unregulated and ad hoc pickup trucks (commonly known as “====”), and walking. Under these circumstances, anyone who can afford one opts to buy a car. Maputo thus provides a useful case study for exploring perceptions of walkability and how these affect the ability of all members of society to exercise their RTTC.====The paper will critically examine how the intersections of income, race and gender influence walking behaviours and experiences of the Right to the City and the influence of the walking environment on walking attitudes. The analysis presented in the paper build on a qualitative dataset composed of 22 semi-structured interviews and a journey audit exercise. The paper interrogates the links between walking and social and economic inequalities in an under-researched urban context in the global South. Our analysis allows dissecting details about the role of (un)favourable pedestrian infrastructure for walking practices of different socioeconomic groups, social stigmas and people's perceptions of walkability. The paper provides empirical evidence on the contradictions of a walking environment that least accommodates low-income residents' needs, despite them being more likely to walk than their higher-income counterparts. By examining practices, perceptions and attitudes, this research develops a context-sensitive reflection about the role of walking in the exercise of the RTTC. This research contributes to debates around walkability in African and Global South cities, highlighting specific learnings for Maputo. While the paper does not aim to generalise its findings, it brings to the fore a snapshot critique of structural issues around walking practices and environments with the potential to inform broader debates about walking and the RTTC. It also provides insight into the perceptions and social norms that shape the city's pedestrian space, which are likely to manifest in similar contexts.","Walkability and the Right to the city: A snapshot critique of pedestrian space in Maputo, Mozambique",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000214,31 March 2021,2021,Research Article,113.0

One of the most popular city logistics schemes is probably the Urban Consolidation Centre, which aims to reduce the number of freight movements in urban areas through consolidation of goods and optimisation of deliveries. Due to its potential to reduce the negative impact of urban freight transport, the consolidation centre has been widely supported by local, national, and European authorities. However, there is a lack of performance evaluation (ex-post analysis) and little research on methods and tools to evaluate and quantify the actual benefits. This research work proposes a model based on a set of indicators that allow assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of an Urban Consolidation Centre in terms of costs, time, quality, productivity, and environmental sustainability. Ex-ante and ex-post evaluations are performed through a case study approach to validate the model. Results show that the model is suitable to both applications and can be customised to deliver tailored performance evaluations.","Urban freight Consolidation Centres (UCC) have been widely named as a promising solution to improve the efficiency of logistics companies’ operations through the consolidation of goods (Wagner, 2010; McKinnon & Woodburn, 1994), while reducing congestion and emissions from last-mile deliveries (Nordtømme et al., 2015). However, despite the high benefits of an UCC, a successful implementation strongly depends on the degree of involvement of the city stakeholders in the decision-making process (Macharis, 2000; Anand et al., 2019, p. 100797), and on the ability of logistics operators in offering a competitive delivery service to their customers. According to Paddeu (2017), considering the high environmental benefits and the related social advantages, usually UCCs are economically supported by European, national, or local authorities especially during the first period of their lifetime. However, usually they are not able to reach the critical demand to become financially self-supporting and they stop operating when the public subsides finish (Dablanc, 2007). Also, all the claims towards benefits coming from an UCC are based on theories and weak evidence, as the literature provides little contribution on quantitative data analysis, and usually ex-post evaluation is not carried out (Dablanc, 2007, Zenezini and De Marco, 2016). This makes it difficult to understand the actual contribution of UCCs to reduce the negative impacts of urban freight, while ensuring operational efficiency of freight flows (Paddeu, 2017). Thompson (2014) highlights the importance of evaluating the performance of urban freight measures in order to understand the efficiency of a system, and to identify potential problems and related solutions in case of inefficiencies. However, only a very limited number of cities monitor the performance of urban freight policies and measures (Akgün et al., 2019).====This paper proposes a model to assess freight transport and logistics performance of an Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC). The model draws on five performance attributes, which include a set of specific key performance indicators (KPIs). The model was tested either for an ex-ante and ex-post evaluation within two case studies: (1) the UCC serving the neighbouring cities of Bristol and Bath, UK (ex-post evaluation); (2) the potential implementation of a UCC serving the city of Cagliari, Italy (ex-ante evaluation). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents previous works on urban freight evaluation tools and models; Section 3 presents the FAPA framework, which is tested in Section 4.

We develop an augmented ,"The emerging economies focus on spatial transformations through infrastructure development to achieve competitiveness and collective prosperity. Infrastructure reshapes geographical connectivity and helps in the agglomeration of economic activities (Fujita & Krugman, 2004). It reduces trade costs and facilitates trade flows between countries, therefore positively influences economic development (Cohen, 2010). The collective regional prosperity and growth depend on the spillover effects of infrastructure (Chen & Haynes, 2015b). Several attempts have been made to quantify the spillover effects of the infrastructure. These studies, however, provide inconsistent results regarding the direction and significance of spillover effects. Some studies have shown positive spillover effects of infrastructure (Dehghan Shabani & Safaie, 2018; Li, Wen, & Jiang, 2017; Qi, Shi, Lin, Yuen, & Xiao, 2020), while others have shown negative or no spillover effects of infrastructure on economic growth (Ozbay, Ozmen-Ertekin, & Berechman, 2007).====The lack of consensus on outcomes of these studies stems from prevailing conditions of proximate factors that channel the spillover effect of infrastructure (Esfahani & Ramı́rez, 2003). Calderon, Cantu, and Chuhan-Pole (2018, p. 2) stated that “====.” A strand of literature signifies the role of institutions and regional integration as underlying factors to shape infrastructure contribution (Calderon et al., 2018; Chen & Haynes, 2015a). Institutions reduce transaction costs, thus providing a favorable environment for channeling the impact of infrastructure on economic growth (Calderon et al., 2018; Tanzi & Davoodi, 1998). Regional integration allows free access to the regional markets, ensures the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers, promotes intra-regional trade and investment, hence economic development (Iqbal & Nawaz, 2017).====We contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of infrastructure by examining the impact of multidimensional infrastructure development on economic growth after controlling institutions and regional integration in Asia. We further evaluate the spillover effects of infrastructure using spatial analysis. We develop an augmented endogenous growth model to test the complementarity between proximate factors and infrastructure to explain regional growth dynamics. The case of Asia is exciting due to several reasons. First, the region has shown steady economic growth of more than 5.5%, with significant variations across countries, accompanied by a substantial poverty reduction.==== Secondly, since 2009, the annual infrastructure investments have reached 8% of GDP, mainly financed by the public sector. Despite mega investments, the quality of infrastructure is low in the region compared to developed regions.==== Thirdly, regional integration has been intensified in Asia since the 1990s, as evident from free trade agreements, foreign direct investment, and financial integration.==== Lastly, Asian economies lag in institutional quality than developed countries.==== These facts provide a unique platform to study the economic contribution of infrastructure in Asia. The varying quality and differences in the provision of infrastructure in the region help to examine the relative importance of quantity and quality dimensions to explain the economic spillover effects of infrastructure.====The empirical analysis is based on 35 Asian economies during the 2006–2016 period using the spatial Durbin panel model. The results show that infrastructures have a positive and significant effect, both direct and spillover, on regional development. The quality of the infrastructure has a relatively higher direct impact, and the quantity has a relatively high spillover effect. These results show that the amount of infrastructure is more beneficial for the regions. On the contrary, quality is more fruitful for the country. Furthermore, the analysis confirms the complementarity of infrastructure with institutions and regional integration, which implies that these factors act as a stimulus to improve the spillover effects of the infrastructure.====We add to the literature on the impact of infrastructure on economic growth in three important ways. First, we develop an augmented endogenous growth model that incorporates institutions and regional integration in defining the spillover effects of infrastructure. Earlier literature does not explicitly include underlying factors in their modeling framework (Chen & Haynes, 2015b; Esfahani & Ramı́rez, 2003). The augmented model helps to investigate the complementarity between infrastructure and proximate factors to boot economic development. Second, the impacts of infrastructure on economic development may differ in Asian regions due to variation in proximate factors. Evidence on the effects of infrastructure on economic growth in Asia is, however, scant. Earlier, studies have examined the effectiveness of infrastructure in developed regions, mainly focus on the USA, Europe, and China (Álvarez, Barbero, & Zofío, 2016; Chen & Haynes, 2015b; Ojede, Atems, & Yamarik, 2018).====Third, we build a multidimensional infrastructure index using the Alkire and Foster (AF) method, including quantity and quality dimensions (Alkire & Foster, 2011; Nawaz & Iqbal, 2020). The quantity dimension is attained using telecom, power, broadband, and air, while the quality dimension is based on electricity, port, and road. This allows capturing the multidimensionality of the infrastructure. Finally, our study uses the latest available data on cross-country infrastructure indicators to develop a multidimensional infrastructure index for empirical analysis. Our study is closely related to Wang, Lim, Zhang, Zhao, and Lee (2020). This study shows that transport infrastructure (roads and railway) plays a positive role in enhancing economic growth in the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) countries. This study finds a significant positive spillover of transport infrastructure effects on economic growth in the BRI countries. We differ from Wang et al. (2020) in terms of our region focus, infrastructure measures, and the inclusion of proximate factors in the analysis.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of existing literature with gaps.

Urban walkability can improve economic performance (Leinberger & Alfonzo, 2012). It encourages trade and competitiveness and increases land and property values (TFL, 2005). Walking benefits the environment by reducing vehicle miles traveled (Diao & Ferreira, 2014) which could itself reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption (Lovasi et al., 2012). Walking causes practically no noise or air pollution. Improving walking conditions also improves physical and mental health (Howell et al., 2017; Sallis et al., 2016) which is an important concern for many societies in Europe (James et al., 2004), the US (Ogden et al., 2006) and many developing countries (Prentice, 2006). Because of many benefits associated with walking, plenty of local and regional authorities have been planning to promote walking for transportation in daily travel in recent years. Among various travel purposes, commuting between home and work is an aspect of everyday life that could be an opportunity for increasing walking and making communities more vibrant and helping to have a healthy lifestyle. In order to motivate people to walk more in daily travel, previous researches have tried to understand the influence of different factors on walking trips actually taken (i.e., the objective amount of walking). However, an important research question which is probably interesting to transportation planners and policy makers, would be that whether there is any potential to walk more in daily commute patterns (i.e., work-tours) or not. In fact, do people have any alternative commute pattern relative to their current pattern in which walking time (or distance) is more? If so, how can different measures encourage people to their alternative pattern? Which measure is more attractive to commuters?====This study sets out to answer the questions raised above by exploring the role of various factors on workers’ likelihood to use an alternative commute pattern in which the walking time is more. In other words, this study examines the tendency to walk more in work tour(s) by examining the probability of encouragement to the alternative commute pattern. Among various factors, the main focus is to understand how various measures could activate the potential for walking in work-tour(s) and what is the relative strength and order of different measures. In addition to various measures, the effect of built-environmental characteristics, individual/household characteristics and travel characteristics including the type of commute mode that is currently used by workers have been examined. A tour is defined in this paper as a complete home-to-home journey where the origin of the first trip is home and the destination of the last trip is home. No intermediate home stop is present within the tour and whenever the home location is reached, a tour is formed. This study takes place in the city of Rasht, Iran, and tries to provide an insight into the case of walking in a country which has not been well addressed in previous research. Rasht suffers from heavy traffic jams and the city officials are very interested in providing more opportunities for walking in daily travel patterns.====The results of this study could have implications for transportation, and even public health professionals and planners who are trying to effectively increase the overall use of walking and also more physical activity in daily travel patterns. The paper starts with a review of the literature on walking behavior focusing on policy approaches, and empirical findings. This is followed by a description of data used in this paper.

However, there is a significant gap between the demand for large-scale transport infrastructure and investments in such infrastructure. An investigation into the causes of the above gap brings to light the inefficiencies of the current capital deployment practices throughout the project life cycle that result in additional expenditure over the optimal investments. This paper aims to review the existing body of knowledge on capital deployment efficiencies of large-scale transport infrastructure investments. The review looks into the causes of inefficiencies and practices applied for efficiency enhancement. Pareto analysis is used to prioritise the causes, and a cause and effect diagram is drawn to identify the root causes for inefficiencies. Finally, practices applied in different stages of the project life cycle are discussed. Based on these findings, a decision support outline is suggested to enhance the efficiency of each identified cause. The findings of this study provide an important foundation to set up a strategic approach to improve capital deployment efficiency of large-scale transport infrastructure investments. Accordingly, a strategic approach is proposed in policy, organisation, and project level activities to improve the capital deployment efficiency of large-scale transportation infrastructure investments in developing countries. Existing studies primarily focus on the technological advancements, without focusing on healthier ","Well-functioning resilient infrastructure and timely investments improve citizens' quality of life and enhance a country's economy (Aldonat, Karacal, & Yetkiner, 2014; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013). Global population growth and urban sprawl are the key to stimulating demand for infrastructure development. According to Oxford Economics, between 2016 and 2040, the world requires 3.5% of the global Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in transport infrastructure investment for each year to meet the rising transport infrastructure demand (Global Infrastructure Hub, 2017; PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2014a; World Economic Forum, 2018b). Emerging markets and developing economies require approximately $400 billion to $452 billion USD in transport infrastructure investments annually. However, the current investments are nested within a range of $200 billion to $250 billion per year (Ruiz-nuñez & Wei, 2015). This indicates that the current expenditure on infrastructure investments must be doubled to create a healthy infrastructural network in future.====Transport infrastructure investments amount to 31% of the total infrastructure funds, and represent the second-largest financing category (Ruiz-nuñez & Wei, 2015; World Economic Forum, 2018a). Large-scale transportation infrastructure investment (LSTII) projects are typically federal or provincial-level improvements, funded by the public sector, private sector, or donors. The main purpose of these types of projects is to meet the essential infrastructure requirements through speedy and convenient transport systems, which are required to fulfil the gradually growing demands coming from passengers and freight (Yucelgazi & Yitmen, 2019b). It is evident that transport infrastructure investments have long-term impacts on the economic growth countries, in terms of increasing GDP and reducing unemployment through enhanced accessibility and mobility (Gharehbaghi & Georgy, 2015; Magazzino & Mele, 2020).====Actual transport infrastructure investments vary significantly compared to the predicted global infrastructure investment needs (Aldonat et al., 2014). According to literature, South Asian countries report the largest gap between actual and budgeted infrastructure investments. This gap is followed by China and the East Asian countries (Kim, Hewings, & Amir, 2017; Ruiz-nuñez & Wei, 2015). North America and Europe have lower gaps compared to other regions; the majority of their investments are to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure (Locatelli, Mariani, Sainati, & Greco, 2017). There is limited investment relating to growth in demand in North American and European countries compared to other regions of the world (Locatelli et al., 2017; Ruiz-nuñez & Wei, 2015).====Almost all countries have experienced differences in the actual and budgeted investment capitals (Love, Sing, Wang, Irani, & Didibhuku, 2014; Makovšek, 2014). Hence, different practices are employed to minimise the investment cost to gain maximum capital efficiency. Integration of processes, selecting efficient management practices, and gaining the expected levels of capital management by aligning with the overall project life cycle are the applied practices that enhance the capital deployment efficiency (Global Infrastructure Hub, 2017; Locatelli et al., 2017). Capital deployment efficiency in the LSTIIP can be enhanced by introducing better practices, policies, and procedures with a view of improving planning at each phase of the project life cycle (Odeck, 2014).====Literature reveals that several research studies have been conducted to evaluate the possible reasons for inefficiencies in cost performances and to improve investment efficiencies (Raimondo, 2016). However, little focus is observed on the total project life cycle or investigations into causes of inefficiencies at each stage, generally due to unavailability of data (Odeck, 2004). Besides, different practices to improve cost performance are applied ad hoc without enhancements to the overall capital deployment efficiency throughout the project life cycle (Chartered Professional Accountants Canada, 2019). Therefore, the comprehensive literature review shows that the existing studies have only investigated either the causes of inefficiencies in cost performances or the application of practices to improve capital deployment efficiency of LSTII project life cycle (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2016). To improve the capital deployment efficiency of LSTIIs, however, a study that combines both these aspects must be undertaken (Sumana & Hegde, 2014).====This paper presents a comprehensive content analysis of both the causes for capital deployment inefficiencies and the practices that improve capital deployment efficiencies. The objective of this study is to identify the causes of capital deployment inefficiencies in LSTIIP and to investigate literature-based solutions to minimise those inefficiencies. In order to achieve this main objective, the following sub-objectives are defined: 1) identifying and categorising causes for the inefficiencies in cost performances for LSTIIP, considering different stages of the project life cycle; 2) reviewing the existing practices that reduce the capital deployment inefficiencies in LSTIIP; 3) discussing the relationship between possible causes and potential solutions in order to improve capital deployment efficiency of LSTIIP, and 4) proposing a strategic map to be deployed in the South Asian countries. The findings of this paper guide the development of a strategic approach to improve capital deployment efficiency. The detailed analysis of the root causes that make an impact on the capital deployment and application of the most applicable practice to reduce the specific cause fulfils the gap in the literature by providing a holistic picture. However, causes that make an impact on the project may be identified from the similar completed projects and then the practices are incorporated in future projects. If a similar type of completed project is limited, then it is difficult to recognize the most critical causes that affect the new projects. Moreover, the conclusions in this study will help save public funds, enhance investment opportunities, and improve short-run capital deployment efficiencies. Furthermore, these results will favorably make an impact on the economic growth and citizens’ quality of life in the long run (Makovšek, 2014).",Improving the capital deployment efficiency: An infrastructure investment planning process in transportation project,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000202,10 March 2021,2021,Research Article,117.0

We find that airlines tend to follow the market leader and enter a route already served by the incumbent. Moreover, using multilayer network variables, our analysis confirms that entry is more likely when the airline operates other routes at the two endpoints of the target route. On the managerial side, our results may help each airline to foresee and therefore anticipate the competitors' entry move. On the policy side, our approach, based on multilayer network theory, may be adopted by competition authorities to detect possible firm's practices that can result from airlines' network, and, more generally, by national public authorities to understand the centrality of each airline's network in each country.","In the past two decades the U.S. airline industry has experienced several mergers and acquisitions which redefined the route map of the carriers. Although it is possible that the same route was served by the two merging airlines, in general there was little overlap in the nonstop routes. In some cases, the route map, henceforth network, of the two merging airlines would even complement perfectly. For example, the merger between US Airways and America West gave the East Coast-based US Airways a hub in the west, forming a network which could allow the newly merged airline to cover most of the U.S. domestic market.====Such a consolidation process may affect the way in which airlines think of route entry, since it is plausible that the decision to enter a route may depend on the extent to which the route endpoints are linked to the network of the incumbent and to the network of the entrant.====Our work gives emphasis to such network component and studies the route entry decision by airlines using elements of multilayer network theory. Our approach is new to the airline literature, since most of the applications of multilayer network theory pertain computer science, physics and mathematics (Bassett & Sporns, 2017; Boccaletti et al., 2014; Kivelä et al., 2014).==== In this way we contribute to the empirical literature on entry adding the important tool of multilayer network theory that could not only be applied to the airline industry, but also to other emerging transport sectors, such as high-speed rail or long-distance bus service, which base their operations on networks.====Our empirical analysis uses data on the U.S. domestic market observed during the period 2012–2019 and estimates the entry decision of the main U.S. carriers using a random effect probit panel data model. We find that airlines tend to follow the market leader and prefer to open a route already served by their competitor, unless the airport concentration at one endpoint of the route is high. Moreover, our analysis confirms, with multilayer network variables, that entry is more likely when the airline is already present at both route endpoints by operating other routes, in line with the seminal work by Berry (1992).====The implications that originate from our analysis can be both managerial and policy oriented. On managerial side, this paper provides airline managers with a tool to foresee which route(s) the competitors have more incentive to enter, so that any entry-deterrence strategy can be anticipated and applied to few specific routes with surgical precision. On the policy side, our methodology may be adopted by national public authorities to understand the centrality of each airline's network in each country. Competition authorities may also be interested in our approach to detect possible airlines' practices stemming from their route network that can eventually affect the entire market structure.====This paper continues with the review of the relevant literature, followed by a description of the data used in our analysis.

To this end, weekly data on the air service volumes are analyzed through an ==== SARIMA model and a counterfactual analysis covering the 2016–2020. We find that the real effect of COVID-19 was a reduction above 80% in all world's macro-regions in May 2020, and still a decrease of about 70% at the end of the Summer 2020, with the only exception of China and Eastern Asia, and North America, where the reductions are, respectively, −29% and −54%. The empirical evidence confirms that the impact of the pandemic crisis and of the subsequent lockdown has been dramatic, much higher than any previous crisis. We also find that the impact is greater for intercontinental connections and for FSCs, while LCCs appear to be slightly more resilient. These results confirm that airline economic sustainability is currently at high risk, and that the unequal resources of the various countries in subsidizing national airlines could generate a competitive imbalance in the future."," and ==== points out a +6.7% annual increase in passengers demand since year 2010). ==== reports lower annual demand increase in Europe (+1.9% in the period 2019–2040), but shares the same optimistic view.====These positive sentiment was literally destroyed by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, which started in China in January 2020 and then spread to Europe and all over the world (it currently involves 188 countries). Since the beginning of the crisis, the numbers have shown that the lockdown adopted in most countries with infections has had dramatic effects in the industry. ==== estimates for the full year 2020 an overall reduction ranging from 32% to 59% of seats offered by the airlines, an overall reduction of 1815 to 3213 million passengers, and about USD 236 to 416 billion potential reduction of airlines’ gross operating revenues (if we take the central value of this range we get that airlines are losing 1 billion USD a day). ICAO considers some scenarios relating to the easing period and the end of the lockdown, i.e., V-shaped, U-shaped, or L-shaped. At the moment it is not possible to say with certainty which of these scenarios is the prevailing one. However, the latter scenario, at least for year 2020 and probably also for 2021, it is very likely to prevail. Hence, it is highly likely that the air transport sector will not quickly return to pre-crisis levels.==== Furthermore, the greater use of smart-working during the lockdown could lead executives to severely limit business travels in the future, negatively impacting long-distance business flights, which represent the most profitable segment of the market.====Despite the above uncertainty about the future, it is now possible to provide estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the consequent lockdown on the air transportation activities, and of the recovery taking place in the post-lockdown period. Moreover, using an appropriate ==== method, it is possible to identify the real effect of COVID-19. To this purpose, a simply intertermporal comparison of observed data may be misleading. A proper estimate must rely on the comparison to a conterfactual scenario, i.e., the levels that would have been observed in the absence of COVID-19. It is also interesting to analyze whether the outbreak has had the same impact on the different world's macro-regions, and if full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs) have been affected in the same way. These are precisely the goals of this paper, namely (1) to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the air transport sector using a counterfactual analysis, and (2) to identify which macro-regions and airline business models have been most penalized.====The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent phenomenon. The first official data for China date back to the beginning of January 2020. Towards the end of February 2020, the pandemic spread to Italy, and within a few weeks across Europe and the world. The resulting lockdown was generally implemented since mid-March, and has forced about 4 billion people into their homes and stopped the vast majority of businesses, including air transportation. After about two months the lockdown was gradually lifted, maintaining more limited restrictions on the movement of people between some countries. This coincided with a general resumption of activities during the summer of 2020. Regarding air transport, the recovery was partial, as will be seen below. In fact, many people have not resumed flying, merely moving within national borders, and business travel is still significantly reduced.====Being the COVID-19 a recent event, there are not many contributions in the literature. As far as we know, the majority of the few available studies have analyzed the impact of the air travel ban on the spread of coronavirus. ==== study the impact of lockdown on the COVID-19 contagion rate in the Wuhan area in China, and find that the restrictions on flights from/to China delayed the progression of the epidemic in that area but they didn't have a big impact in limiting the spread all over the world. ==== investigate the same issue and find that the air travel ban and the consequent lockdown have led to a significant decrease in the contagion rate, i.e., from 2 to 4 days to observe a doubling in the number of infected people. ==== analyze the vulnerability of African countries to the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak using the volume of air travel departing from China and directed to Africa and find that aviation is a driver of contagion and this exposes some countries more than others. ==== develop a model to measure the risk, in the early months of 2020, of the disease spreading outside China, and identify the countries most affected by the pandemic. The predictive model identifies the passengers from the Hubei region as the main driver of the growth of the first COVID-19 cases in many countries.====Some recent contributions have instead investigated the impact of COVID-19 on different dimensions of aviation. ==== analyze the changes in the global aviation network due to the pandemic, focusing on network metrics, number of O-D pairs, and number of aircraft in operation. They find a stronger impact in the Southern hemisphere and a more marked connectivity reduction in international flights compared to domestic ones, especially in the US. ==== examine the impact of COVID-19 on airports’ performances, and highlight that, given the large decrease in passengers and traffic, there is a need for public subsidization. ====Some other contributions have investigated the influence of other exogenous shocks on air transport. ==== study the impact of the 11th September 2001 terrorist attacks on US air travel demand, and find that both domestic and international air traffic were significantly impacted, but only temporarily. After only one month following the terrorist attack to the Twin Towers, the industry had recovered to pre-shock levels. Other papers have exploited some quasi-natural experiments due to exogenous shocks to identify either the contribution of air transportation to regional growth in the US (====).==== ==== analyze, instead, the effects of a new European airport regulation on aeronautical charges.==== and ====. Hence, differently from ====, ==== and ====, we do not assess the impact of COVID-19 on aviation activity using observed data, but we estimate its causal effect by comparing the observed trend with a counterfactual, i.e., a trend that would be observed in absence of an exogenous shock. This means that the counterfactual trend is generated by using the data before the exogenous shock (the lockdown) in order to have a projection after it (the post-period trend).====We analyze the effects of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown on air transportation by applying a ITS framework with errors following a SARIMA model to a weekly data set from the beginning of 2016 to 8th September 2020. The reference date chosen for the lockdown is different among the world macro-regions, and it is identified using the share of grounded scheduled seats due to the travel ban. Consequently, the lockdown started in different weeks of March 2020. This means that our data set can be divided into two sub-samples: several pre-lockdown weeks (ranging between 220 and 222) and 24–26 post-lockdown weeks. Such a structure, combined to the utilization of an ITS model with SARIMA errors, allows to study the observed trend of the industry for the period before and after the lockdown, and to check the magnitude of the recovery during the Summer 2020.====Regarding aviation activity, we focus on three key supply-side variables of the air transport industry: seats available on scheduled commercial flights around the world, flight frequencies, and total ASKs.====The data are extracted from the OAG archive and are grouped by 10 world macro-areas: North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, Oceania, Central Asia & India, South-East Asia, and Eastern Asia & China.====Clearly, it may be interesting to study other supply-side effects due to the lockdown. For instance, many airlines have adopted a cancellation strategy after the lockdown: flights are scheduled (and hence seats are available), but then are canceled if the load factor is too low. This cancellation policy may further reduce the available seats during the recovery period. However, we have no data regarding offered and then canceled seats.====Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak has also exerted a strong effect on the demand for air transportation. Both business and leisure travels have been dramatically reduced. This may be a long-lasting effect, since the pandemic may have changed the willingness to travel. We can observe some features of the demand side, since we have data regarding the bookings up to June 2020, i.e., the first month of resumption of activity in air transport after the lockdown. Hence, we can only look at some short-run effects regarding the demand side, while the long-run impact on the willingness to travel, and on the interaction with airlines capacity and supply strategies, might be explored when more data will be available.====Last, the lockdown has affected cargo activities. The e-commerce market has exploded because consumers, not being able to go to brick-and-mortar stores, have provided a very strong impulse to online orders using channels such as Amazon, Alibaba, etc. This significant push in demand for products transported by air has mainly turned towards integrators (DHL, Fedex, UPS, etc.). In fact, full-service airlines carry out cargo services mainly using the hold capacity on passenger aircraft. ==== find that integrators capacities surpassed their nominal values in North-East Asia, North America and Europe since March 2020. ==== argue that the significance of air cargo has been vindicated by the Covid-19 crisis. Shipments of food and medical supplies have been protected by governments to ensure the supply of basic necessities. ==== focus on the China market and confirms that air cargo suffered a less severe depression than passengers during the period December 2019–May 2020. The IATA cargo industry outlook (====) points out that, despite an extra-utilization, freighters are insufficient. The ongoing capacity crunch continues to be driven by the lack of international passenger traffic. In July 2020, international belly cargo capacity was down by 70.5% on year-on-year base, a modest progress from the peak of the crisis in April (−82.5%). All these contributions highlight that the impact of COVID-19 on full-cargo traffic has been exactly the opposite than the dramatic decrease occurred in passenger activity. However, we do not have data on cargo volumes and focus only on the passenger segment effects, which is, in any case, the most important one in the air transportation sector.====The paper is organized as follows: Section ==== presents the econometric model adopted to estimate the effect of the lockdown and the counterfactuals in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Section ==== presents the data and provides a first descriptive analysis of the impacts. Section ==== shows the results of the econometric analysis, while Section ==== highlights the main evidence achieved.

For this purpose, the impacts for each stakeholder were identified, their monetization was incorporated in the analysis and the results were discussed in light of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. Two Brazilian cases are used to apply the proposed methodology. The results show that when socio-environmental impacts, such as a reduction in traffic congestion and pollution emissions, are incorporated into the economic evaluation, implementation is justified for cities with high levels of traffic congestion. This study might improve the future analysis of urban consolidation center projects by performing a more comprehensive economic evaluation. Notably, it includes social, environmental and monetary benefits for different stakeholders, and is relevant for practitioners and public administrators.","The world population is already more urban than rural. The global urbanization rate increased from 30% in 1950 to the current 55% and it is expected that it will reach 68% in 2050 (WB, 2017). In Brazil, the rate was 84.4% in 2010 (IBGE, 2017) and it will reach 91% in 2050 (UN, 2014). Cities play an important economic role, where more than 80% of world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is generated (WB, 2017). It is quite common to find cities' neighborhoods with a high concentration of retail stores, restaurants and bars, pharmacies, service shops, etc. Supplying this variety of different types of stores is a challenge, especially as they are attractors of people and cargo and consequently, of traffic; urban freight distribution is often characterized by high transaction costs, asymmetric information and conflict of interest among stakeholders (Danielis et al., 2010).====The combination of optimizing urban goods flows and minimizing the adverse social and environmental effects is the cornerstone of City or Urban Logistics (Taniguchi et al., 2001; Dablanc, 2007; Thompson & Taniguchi, 2008; Taniguchi, 2014). The Urban Consolidation Center (====) is one of the most implemented and studied city logistics initiatives (Björklund & Johansson, 2018), mainly to support last-mile deliveries (Aljohani & Thompson, 2019; Paddeu et al., 2018). UCCs can be defined as logistics facilities established in urban areas whose objective is to organize the cargo flow, coming from outside, to be delivered inside the service area, consolidating deliveries in cargo vehicles with maximized load factor and optimized routes (Allen et al., 2012; Björklund et al., 2017; Browne et al., 2005; Lebeau et al., 2017; Panero et al., 2011). Some examples of the benefits reported by a UCC implementation are improvements in vehicle load factors of 15%–100%, reductions in vehicle kilometers traveled ranging from 60% to 80%, and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions between 25% and 80% (Allen et al., 2012). Then, it can be used for coordinating cargo flow within an urban area or act as the connection between urban and long-distance transport (Olsson & Woxenius, 2014). Moreover, environmental improvements can be achieved by using a UCC, reducing truck kilometers driven in the city by about 65% and reducing emissions by about 70%, as in the case of Copenhagen (van Heeswijk et al., 2019).====Regardless of the benefits, relatively few UCCs are in operation. According to Allen et al. (2012), from 1970 to 2010, from 114 studied UCC schemes, only 50 were operational. Costs of extra transshipments affect the economic viability which is commonly cited as a relevant constraint for UCC implementations and also dependence on subsidies is also a common issue for implementing UCCs (van Heeswijk et al., 2019). Many studies indicate that UCCs are not financially sustainable (Nocera & Cavallaro, 2017). Some stakeholders of city logistics (i.e., shippers, receivers and carriers) are not willing to pay additional costs for using them (Kin et al., 2016) and public funding is often mentioned as required, mainly in the first years of the operation (Browne et al., 2011; IPPUC, 2014; Janjevic & Ndiaye, 2017; Kin et al., 2016; Panero et al., 2011; Van Rooijen & Quak, 2014), perhaps for a few years (Akgün et al., 2020). According to Paddeu et al. (2018), UCCs add the complexity of supply chain management, requiring additional contracts, different movement stages and efficiency in communication among players. Moreover, according to Holguín-Veras and Sánchez-Díaz (2016), in a UCC scheme, shippers can be negatively impacted by their participation. The authors state: “====”.====Considering the concepts of Welfare Economics, the impact on society (embracing different interests of stakeholders in urban freight distribution) and the environment might be part of the comprehensive economic evaluation. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can be understood as an application of the Kaldor-Hicks Criterion, which is described as a less stringent criterion than Pareto's efficiency. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion considers that a change is desirable if the “winners” would be able to compensate the “losers” and still be better off. The compensation is not actually paid, otherwise having the “winners” compensating the “losers”, the analysis becomes Pareto's efficiency, where the change leads to a better situation and nobody loses (Coleman, 1980; Hicks, 1939; Hohl & Tisdell, 1997; Jones & Sugden, 1982; Kaldor, 1939; Platts, 1978; Posner, 1980). The Kaldor-Hicks Criterion is applied in analyses focused on public policies, sustainability and wealth distribution and the implementation of the proposed change (a project or policy) might be considered if their social benefits exceed their social costs (Jones & Sugden, 1982; OECD, 2006; Posner, 1980). In Kaldor-Hicks criterion applications, each stakeholder is analyzed separately, helping to understand which ones are benefited and hampered by the new situation.====Some scholars have been addressing socio-environmental benefits in project analysis by monetizing externalities as pollutant emissions, such as CO====, NOx and PM2.5, associated with urban distribution, especially for European cities (Alessandrini et al., 2012; Estrada & Roca-Riu, 2017; Fernandez-Barcelo & Campos-Cacheda, 2012). Considering environmental aspects in the implementation and operational phases of a UCC, CBA was provided by Browne et al. (2007). However, establishing a business model that can balance environmental, economic and operational requirements to implement a UCC, considering different stakeholders' interests, is still a challenge (Björklund et al., 2017). In line with this, there is a gap in studies for developing countries, as well as in methodologies to evaluate if the social benefits of implementing a UCC exceed its social costs.====The objective of this research is two-fold: to present a methodology to include socio-environmental impact monetization in the economic evaluation of urban consolidation center projects, and to discuss the result of UCC projects' economic evaluations considering foundations of the Welfare Economics. For this purpose, the impacts were identified for each stakeholder, their monetization was incorporated into the analysis and results were discussed in light of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. The research contributes to developing a comprehensive UCC economic evaluation, which incorporates external impacts, such as losses due to traffic congestion and exposition to local pollutants. It proposes to shift the focus of analysis restricted to UCC freight and operating costs to a more inclusive analysis, considering the impact on society.====This research is structured considering: the UCC impact analysis for each stakeholder and their proposed monetization (Section 2); the methodology applied to two Brazilian cases, São Paulo and Curitiba, where the first considers hypothetical data and the last is based on data from a real UCC case study (Section 3); the results and discussions considering the Kaldor-Hicks criterion (Section 4); and conclusion of this work (Section 5).",Urban consolidation centers: Impact analysis by stakeholder,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000172,27 February 2021,2021,Research Article,120.0

In the wake of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), our findings suggest that future investment in the transport sector should focus more on railways in improving the industrial growth and output of the country.","Transport infrastructure is a precursor to sustainable economic growth in Pakistan. Improving transport and connectivity remains one of the seven priorities in the government's Vision 2025 plan, as it aims to achieve significant, sustained, and inclusive growth.==== Major institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are actively working with the government to formulate transport policies and strengthen governance and regulations within the sector.====Improving transport infrastructure will have a positive spillover effect on economic growth, creating greater access to global markets, higher foreign investment, opportunities to exploit economies of scale, and enhanced employment opportunities. Transportation investment has been the single largest item in the budgets of developing countries and development aid agencies alike (World Bank, 2008). Transport infrastructure consists of all the basic means of transportation, including roads, railways, airports, and seaports (Deng, 2013). Since the 1990s, the National Highway Authority (NHA) has been responsible for the maintenance of all national highways in Pakistan. An investigation into the effect of different types of transport infrastructure on sustainable industrial growth will shed light on the formulation of transport policies in the near future in Pakistan.====Geographically, Pakistan is centrally located in South Asia, sharing borders with China, India, Afghanistan, and Iran. It is strategically located at the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz, through which 70% of the world's oil trade occurs, and, with more than 700 km of coast on the Arabian Sea, it provides the shortest route for the landlocked, resource-rich countries of Central Asia to access warm waters.====Due to its strategic position in the region, Pakistan has been a key player in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative spearheaded by China. One of the corridors of OBOR is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has been prioritised by the Chinese Central Government. This will be the first corridor to be completed under the OBOR initiative, to be undertaken in three phases by 2030. The CPEC has already attracted a total investment of US$62 billion, a significant part of which is directed towards building roads, ports, and railways.==== Fig. 1 depicts a map of this project.====Transport-related infrastructure development can contribute to economic growth in multiple ways (see Phang, 2003; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013; Short & Kopp, 2005; Wang, 2002; Yamaguchi, 2007). It helps to generate employment opportunities, increases industrial productivity, improves the cost-effectiveness of businesses, and provides access to various public services for citizens engaged in socio-economic activities (Brueckner, 1997; Esfahani & Ramı́rez, 2003; Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2007; Looney & Frederiksen, 1998; Osei–Kyei & Chan, 2016; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013).====However, the literature to date has observed that the economy- and industry-wide effects of transport infrastructure vary significantly, particularly in the cases of developing and emerging economies (Crescenzi et al., 2016). This may be due to differences in geography, physical terrain, and economic structures that direct domestic policies vis-à-vis the development of transport infrastructure in different countries (Clark et al., 2004). In this research, an empirical investigation is conducted in a country-specific setting to analyse the impact of different types of transport infrastructure on industrial growth, using data from Pakistan that spans more than four decades.====Why did we select Pakistan for the analysis?====Following Imran (2009), there is an ongoing discussion amongst the professionals and policy makers about the role of the inter-modal distribution of traffic. The sustainability of the different types of modes cover the foundation of the national transport system. One of the primary goals of the One Belt and One Road initiative (OBOR), otherwise known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is to promote the efficiency and connectivity of transport networks.==== The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), being a key corridor of the six corridors planned for the BRI, connects China and Pakistan through a number of infrastructure projects. The CPEC initiatives account for around $62 billion in development deals; this figure represents approximately 20 per cent of Pakistan's annual GDP (Stevens, 2015). These initiatives have become an integral part of the economy (McCartney, 2018). We focus here on the role of different types of transport in Pakistan in the wake of the CPEC project. This development will increase both public and private investment in the CPEC regions, and will have spillover effects on industrial development, capital investment, and economic output. To our knowledge, there is no study analysing the role of the transport sector with respect to industrial development in Pakistan. We believe that this research is timely, and that it will contribute insights that can be used by policymakers in implementing the CPEC project.====In a comprehensive review, Macharis and Bontekoning (2004) emphasize that there is a growing need for intermodal freight transport research—i.e., for research encompassing roads, railways, ports, and airways. In this connection, the present study makes three major contributions to the existing literature. First, we analyse the impact of different types of transport infrastructure on the industrial value added (a measure of industrial growth) for Pakistan. Roads, railways, ports, and airways are considered separately in our analysis of transport infrastructure. This is the first attempt to include different modes of transport in Pakistan linking industrial value added.====Second, our analysis covers data spanning more than four decades. Accordingly, we consider the possibility of structural breaks in our model, in order to determine whether there are any significant trend breaks with respect to our key variables. Over the last four decades, Pakistan's transportation sector has undergone significant changes. At issue are changes in internal and external policies that may have direct and indirect effects on the transport sector, and thereby influence forecasting.====Third, forecast-error variance decomposition, a contemporary macro-econometric technique, is used to identify the direction of causality and to forecast the effects of different types of transport infrastructure on industrial output. Our findings thus have policy implications, and can provide guidance for investment decisions involving infrastructure and related budgetary allocations.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the literature, highlighting the major findings of related research. This section also provides a brief overview of the transport sector in Pakistan. Section 3 describes the data in detail; it also outlines the time series model and the various robustness checks that we use. Section 4 presents the findings. Finally, section 5 analyses the significance of our key findings, and discusses the relevance of our research for policy decisions.",Transport infrastructure and industrial output in Pakistan: An empirical investigation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000123,24 February 2021,2021,Research Article,121.0

A before-after assessment of an urban horticulture scenario is presented to address the negative impacts of goods distribution within cities. A baseline scenario for the current food system is compared with the proposed one, adapted to local production and consumption through a case study for Belo Horizonte (Brazil). A ","By 2050, the world population is estimated at 9.7 billion people, and two-thirds will live in cities (World population pros, 2019). Food nutrition, security, conventional production, and distribution have been impacted by this rapid urbanization and more prolonged and recurrent events related to climate change; the urban population is dependent on the affordability of purchase food (Giseke et al., 2015; Scharf, Wachtel, Reddy, & Säumel, 2019; Sumner, Hoy, & Ortiz-Juarez, 2020). Therefore, climate change implies additional challenges for cities and peri-urban areas. Events such as droughts and floods have nearly doubled in the last two decades. They can compromise the production capacity and food supply for the urban population, resulting in greater inequity in food access due to the consequent increase in low-order food products (O and City Region Food Sys, 2018; O and The Place of Urban a, 2011; PovertyHunger, 2010).====Even though agri-food and agricultural sectors are important drivers of climate change, they can be considered as a means for mitigation and adaptation concerning the impacts of climate change shocks and stress (O and City Region Food Sys, 2018; O and The Place of Urban a, 2011; Game & Primus, 2015; Benis & Ferrão, 2017; Hallett, Hoagland, & Toner, 2016; Niles & Ahuja, 2017). The discussion concerning agriculture and climate change is extensive, but little has been addressed considering the food system more broadly (Giseke et al., 2015; Niles & Ahuja, 2017; Scharf et al., 2019). Food systems are complex, diverse, and dynamic and concern all activities, resources, and outputs related to pre-production, production, processing, distribution, preparation, and consumption, including food loss and waste (Niles & Ahuja, 2017). The more perishable the food products, the more frequent the replenishment, which contributes to increased congestion levels, longer distances traveled by freight vehicles, increments in emissions of pollutants, visual intrusion, and enhanced accident risks. Also, there are no guarantees of food quality due to the need for agrochemicals and preservatives to support the long journeys to the final consumer, resulting in significant loss and waste due to handling and transportation activities (Angelo, Du Plesis, & Odoemene, 2017; Dimitri, Oberholtzer, & Pressman, 2016; Stone, 2016).====Cities need to change the paradigm of development from prioritizing economic growth to more valuable urban systems' sustainability and resilience. In this perspective, urban agriculture has been consolidated in different cities worldwide to address the challenges presented before. This agri-food model can produce positive results considering environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Such effects concern reducing greenhouse gas emissions, microclimate upgrading, water management improvement, healthier diet habits, and stress reduction, among other benefits (Romeo, Vea, & Thomsen, 2018). Urban agriculture can be performed in different approaches, from community agriculture, small farms, rooftop gardens, among others (Cabannes, 2015; Ding, Liu, & Ravenscroft, 2018; Hallett et al., 2016; Poulsen, 2017; Si et al., 2016; Wiskereke, 2017).====Out of the ten reasons why cities should stimulate sustainable and resilient agri-food systems in urban areas (Network and R, 2019), five issues were investigated, directly or indirectly, in this paper (i) reduce the emission of GHG from activities related to production, transportation, processing, and consumption of agri-food products; (ii) make cities more resilient to climate changes; (iii) support global environmental goals and sustainable development policy; (iv) enhance the resilience of agri-food systems through the diversification of production and distribution systems; and (v) integrate public and private stakeholders in the alimentary governance.====Sustainable urban food systems are more effectively developed by collaboration through shared knowledge and resources among different actors. The concept of “urban commons” (Niles & Ahuja, 2017), which signifies self-organized community systems that do not depend on the market or the state, helps the organization of bottom-up approaches concerning urban food systems' sustainability and resilience. In this perspective, the concept of “urban food commons” was defined as “a shared immaterial or material resource in urban spaces that is food-related (…)"" (Scharf et al., 2019). Food resources are developed and sustained by the community through growth, distribution, processing, storing, and related activities, which imply sharing and creative economic solutions, namely edible city solutions (ECSs) (Scharf et al., 2019; O and City Region Food Sys, 2018; De Cunto, Tegoni, Sonnino, & Michel, 2017). Examples of collaboration in the search for more sustainable urban food systems are establishing wholesaling activities in food hubs (Morganti, 2011; Morganti and Gonzalez-Feliu, 2015a, 2015b, p. 106).====Addressing research efforts to urban food distribution systems can be an efficient way to promote sustainability and resilience concerning food supply, especially in low-income countries. Most food loss and waste in these countries occur in storage and transportation, from production to food retailing (Gustavsson, Cederberg, & Sonesson, 2011; Niles & Ahuja, 2017). These losses in Latin America, the most urbanized region of the Global South, with more than 75% of the population in cities (World population pros, 2019), are the highest globally, estimated at 200 kg per capita annually at upstream distribution stages of the supply chain (Gustavsson et al., 2011). In Brazil, agriculture is an important economic activity, responsible for 5% of Gross Domestic Product, and the per capita emissions regarding this activity are 2163.94 kg CO2 equivalent (Niles & Ahuja, 2017). Even though most of the Brazilian population is urban (86%) (—Brazilian Institute, 2017), agriculture is still incipient in Brazilian cities, and little has been developed regarding the scientific investigation in this country (Sanyé-Mengual et al., 2015, 2018).====Despite their importance, research considering sustainable urban logistics, especially those considering a three-bottom perspective (environment, society, economy), applied directly to cities' food supply has not been numerous (Gonzalez-Feliu, 2018; Morganti, 2011, p. 106; Morganti & Gonzalez-Feliu, 2015a, 2015b; Palacios-Argüello, Gonzalez-Feliu, Gondran, & Badeig, 2018). Sustainability issues for urban food logistics were investigated, to our knowledge, mostly in Europe (Morganti and Gonzalez-Feliu, 2015a, 2015b; Palacios-Argüello et al., 2018). A few studies have considered before-after assessment to measure urban agriculture impacts as an urban logistics solution (Morganti & Gonzalez-Feliu, 2015a, 2015b; Notarnicola et al., 2017a, 2017b; Pérez-Neira and Grollmus-Venegas, 2018; Sala et al., 2017). Some authors (Sanyé-Mengual et al., 2015) have analyzed rooftop greenhouses' environmental and economic performance (RTG) in Barcelona implementing Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Cost methods. RTGs are environmentally efficient options to develop urban agriculture, but yield needs to be further investigated in this production structure. In another study performed for Bologna's city, the authors investigated urban food production's sustainability regarding a stakeholder's perspective through participatory methods and network analyses (Sanyé-Mengual et al., 2018). A longitudinal literature review was performed (Peña & Rovira-Val, 2020) to understand the application of life cycle costing in urban agriculture (UA). Most of the studies consider horticulture (growth of vegetables and fruits) as the scope, and among those reviewed, only 3 investigate the traditional form of UA, such as home gardens. None of the studies presented in this review (Peña & Rovira-Val, 2020), which also considered urban agriculture's environmental dimension, discuss urban agriculture in Latin America. Finally, in (Pérez-Neira and Grollmus-Venegas, 2018), the authors investigated the carbon footprint of peri-urban horticulture in Seville, Spain. They assessed three scenarios considering conventional farms that deliver food products to the city and local community-supported agricultural initiatives, selling directly to the consumer. The methodological approach was a life cycle assessment. The findings show that the direct distribution of vegetables can reduce more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions.====Some of the research gaps presented in the literature, aiming at sustainability in the urban food supply, concern urban food distribution systems directly, including “assessments of the GHG emission balance between the location of food production (local vs. distant, to include location-specific agronomics), transportation, and seasonal supply dynamics” (Niles & Ahuja, 2017). More specifically, logistics and transportation turn out to be aspects of urban agriculture upscaling that has not been well investigated (Peña & Rovira-Val, 2020; Skar et al., 2020; Weidner, Yang, & Hamm, 2019). This gap is addressed in this work. Therefore, this paper concerns a before-after environmental assessment of the impacts concerning the spatial structure changes of production and consumption of vegetables in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In other words, the objective of this work is to perform a comparative analysis between the current production system and an urban horticulture scenario that regards direct distribution to the end-consumer and food waste transformation into organic fertilizer. To this first assessment effort concerning the impact of locational changes between the scenarios, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed, focused on the urban logistics systems' carbon footprint.====This paper is organized as follows. First, the background of this research is introduced. Then, the before-after assessment applied to sustainable urban logistics is conceptualized. The methodological framework for estimating flows and developing the scenarios is presented in the third section, together with the assessment databases and methods and the comparative indicators. The results are presented and discussed in the fourth section. Finally, the practical implications, limitations, and concluding remarks of this study are presented.",A sustainable approach for urban farming based on city logistics concepts for local production and consumption of vegetables,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592100010X,23 February 2021,2021,Research Article,122.0

Through an in-depth literature review, three important theoretical constructs and core determinants have been identified and further validated by a Structural Equation Model (SEM) using continuous indicators either as observable variables or as latent variables. The results show that the cableway supply in the Italian Aosta Valley Region, as a case study representing the typical alpine biodiverse region, is based on a shade public intervention. The success of the cableway system depends mainly on a loyal segment of demand, on middle/high income and on multi-elastic prices policy. Furthermore, the results provide evidence of possible cooperative competition (or win-win co-opetition) amongst agents.","The literature has recently begun to explore the role of cableway systems in sustainable transportation, though studies on this topic are scarce (Brand & Dávila, 2011; Brida et al., 2014; Težak et al., 2011, 2016). Research has also examined the demand and supply of winter cableway services (Evren & Kozak, 2018); however, cableway profitability remains under-researched, and extant studies fail to consider cableways’ multifaceted business environment (Falk & Steiger, 2018; Steiger et al., 2019).====In mountain areas, cableway businesses serving both residents and tourists often struggle to maintain and grow profits, especially during the winter season. The literature shows that ski activity relying on cableway systems has reached maturity in many mountain areas (Kuščer et al., 2017; Steiger et al., 2019). This phase denotes a peak of tourism overnights, at which point a destination begins to lose appeal for first-time visits, attracting mostly repeat customers. To maintain profits, stakeholders must create novel interest by enhancing key infrastructure and marketing. This often creates social and economic conflicts that negatively affect cableway profitability. By the end of a skiing enterprise's life cycle, competition has increased, and many companies suffer losses. Within such a market, it is important to profile customers and target repeaters, who tend to be less price-elastic (Tjørve et al., 2018). Public intervention can be also pivotal in restructuring obsolete infrastructure and planning new revitalization projects. Through taxation, venture capital, and even direct participation, the public can revitalize a sector and guarantee infrastructure maintenance, upgrades and steady water supply for artificial snowmaking. Public action can also protect the environment in less-inhabited areas and facilitate green mobility in remote valleys (Cobo-Soler et al., 2018; European Union, 2019; Scuttari et al., 2016).====This paper provides a multifaced overview of tourism and cableway demand, public intervention and business profitability and competitiveness that mirrors the actual business environment within a mature mountain destination (Falk & Tveteraas, 2019; Zanetti et al., 2005, pp. 28–29). To achieve this aim, the author uses a two-stage flexible framework (i.e. an iterated principal factors [IPF] analysis with no rotation and structural equation modelling [SEM]) to identify the main business drivers. Such a framework connects several elements that are generally analysed separately: in this case, consumers, companies and destination. It also introduces novel indicators, such as the profitability of ski lift companies and online customer satisfaction, that are still under-researched (Cristobal-Fransi et al., 2018; Matzler et al., 2019). In addition, the simultaneous framework supports the identification of short-, middle- and long-run determinants; increased revenues; reduced business risks; greater business opportunities; and better evaluations of economic and financial costs and benefits. From a methodological perspective, SEM is a flexible tool because it deals with a system of regression equations, rather than a single or multiple linear regression (Bollen, 1989; Golob, 2003; Nachtigall et al., 2008). More generally, SEM allows: 1) hypothesis testing, 2) inclusion of both empirical variables and latent variables; 3) inclusion of multiple groups, 4) multilevel analysis, and 5) goodness-of-fit tests (Tarka, 2018).","Demand, business profitability and competitiveness in the cableway system: A multidimensional framework",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000135,21 February 2021,2021,Research Article,123.0

This finding is further supported by the decoupling statuses found. I Improvements in energy efficiency appear to have been effective for environmental protection.","The diversification of the energy mix and the promotion of energy efficiency has been pursued with the aim of attaining environmental sustainability. These mechanisms could well be an effective way to reduce the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions associated with energy use. If supported by appropriate policy frameworks, economies should be able to achieve economic growth without increasing emissions. However, sectors highly dependent on fossil fuels, such as transportation, may frustrate this desired goal. The transition to clean energy in the transportation sector is more challenging than in other sectors where the use of other types of power, such as electricity, is widespread. As a result, the transportation sector has acted as a barrier to altering the existing energy paradigm in many economies. For these reasons, a detailed study of diversification in the transportation energy mix is of singular importance, both to fill a glaring gap in the literature, and to provide guidance for policymaking.====This study aims to examine the potential role of alternative energy sources (renewable fuels and electricity) in reducing oil consumption in the transportation sector. Furthermore, it intends to investigate how economic growth and CO==== emissions are being affected by the penetration of alternative energy sources in the transportation sector. The implementation of alternative energy sources and the promotion of energy efficiency should contribute to reducing CO==== emissions. To examine this, our study also set out to determine whether there is a decoupling effect between economic growth and CO==== emissions in relation to energy consumption by the transportation sector, and energy consumption overall. In the case of the US, this could provide a deeper understanding of the potential pathways to reduce CO==== emissions. Therefore, this paper also aims to capture other aspects related to the introduction of alternative energy sources in the transportation sector, such as the promotion of energy efficiency and the diversification of the entire national energy mix.====An examination of the situation in the US seems to us to be particularly timely and important for both academic literature and for a better understanding of the worldwide context. As a global economic leader, the decisions the US makes have global consequences. Furthermore, it is the world's largest consumer and producer of oil. The historical data shows that, in 2017, the US was responsible for 14.1% of global oil production, and 19.8% of global oil consumption. Moreover, it was responsible for 15.2% of global CO==== emissions (BP, 2018). Additionally, the US is the world's largest producer of biofuels, producing 43.9% in 2017 (BP, 2018). This research appears even more timely given the guidance in the US nowadays. Arguing that it did not want to damage its economic growth and domestic industries, or cause job losses, the US recently opted out of various environmentally friendly international commitments, most notably the Paris Agreement. Thus, the US is not currently involved in setting international guidelines to reduce CO==== emissions and promote the replacement of current energy sources with cleaner ones.====This paper makes several contributions to the literature. Firstly, it analyses the effects of the simultaneous use by transportation of conventional and alternative energy sources on both economic growth and CO==== emissions. Secondly, it analyses the potential of alternative energy types to substitute conventional ones in transportation. Both of these approaches address gaps in the literature that this paper is intended to fill. Thirdly, the paper makes an examination of the current situation in the US that is particularly timely, given the political agenda followed in recent years, and the influence of the US on policy decisions worldwide. Lastly, it looks at the country's global environmental policy in depth, by analysing indicators of the decoupling of CO==== emissions from both energy consumption by the transport sector and by the overall economy and economic growth. Although the decoupling indicator proposed by Tapio (2005) has previously been used for the US (see Li & Jiang, 2020; Song, Zhang, & Zhou, 2019), these studies only considered the emissions caused by total energy consumption. The Tapio elasticity approach, using emissions from transportation was analysed by Wu, Zhu, Zhong, and Zhang (2018), who complemented their study with a decomposition analysis to ascertain the main differences between the Chinese and US economies. In short, this paper contributes with new empirical evidence regarding the effects of the simultaneous use of both conventional and alternative energy sources in transportation, with respect to economic growth, and to decarbonizing the economy. It also provides empirical evidence on the decoupling of emissions from economic growth, paying particular attention to the role of transportation in this decoupling.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Each driver prefers to park closer and walk shorter to the workplace. We present a new equilibrium model by involving ridesharing and parking behaviour. The equilibrium solution implies that the parking density and parking price can significantly influence commuters’ ridesharing choices and arrival times. The optimal parking density is presented to enhance the parking supply. A parking fee discount for ridesharing (PDR) scheme is proposed to encourage ridesharing and hence mitigate congestion. The optimal PDR scheme can save 50% of the system cost at most.,"Traffic congestion has become a challenging issue in most metropolises, especially at peak hours in the morning, which causes economic loss to both individual travellers and governments (Agatz et al., 2012). The bottleneck model, first introduced by Vickrey (1969), is one of the most insightful and tractable approaches to the modeling of queuing overtime and trip-timing decision for each traveller. In the classic bottleneck model, a fixed number of homogeneous commuters travel from home to a single destination of workplace through a bottleneck with a fixed flow capacity. If the arrival rate of commuters at the bottleneck exceeds this capacity, a queue develops. All commuters have the same desired arrival time at the workplace, and incur cost from schedule delay, i.e., cost of arriving early or late. Each commuter has to decide his or her departure time to make a trade-off between the travel time and the schedule delay. A substantial stream of development has been made in the literature, such as heterogeneous commuters (Arnott et al., 1994; Li & Huang, 2019; Lindsey, 2004), stochastic capacity and demand (Arnott et al., 1999), and multiple travel modes (Huang et al., 2007).====In order to relieve congestion, transport economists generally see congestion toll as the best measure to alter the distribution of departure times and consequently improve the system efficiency in the morning commute problem (Arnott, De Palma, & Lindsey, 1990, 1994; Fu et al., 2018). Besides the first-best toll, various second-best tolls were developed to improve the operability, for instance, coarse toll (Arnott, De Palma, & Lindsey, 1990), step-tolling (Lindsey et al., 2012; Li et al. (2017), and distance-based toll (Meng et al., 2012). But congestion toll usually receives political boycott from the public and is hard to implement in practice (Ren & Huang, 2020). In fact, it has been proposed and then scrapped in many places, such as New York, Hong Kong and Copenhagen (Fosgerau & De Palma, 2013). Parking pricing has emerged as an effective substitute in altering commuters’ travel behaviour since travelers are more ready to pay parking fees (Albert & Mahalel, 2006; Fosgerau & De Palma, 2013; Jansson, 2010; Tian et al., 2018).====Chan and Shaheen (2012) defined ridesharing as a non-profit service that connects drivers and passengers who share similar origins and/or destinations. It is an alternative for solo car use and can significantly reduce the number of vehicles on road and ease traffic congestion (Agatz et al., 2012). With the spread of smart phones, a match can be made instantly via a platform, such as Uber and Didi. The main stream of ridesharing literature focuses on the matching of drivers and riders. Various models and algorithms have been proposed to improve ride-matching, e.g, Lee and Savelsbergh (2015); Masoud and Jayakrishnan (2017a, b). Another line of development in the ridesharing study is to explore travellers’ decision-making when ridesharing is introduced as a new optional travel mode and the effect of ridesharing on mitigating traffic congestion. Liu and Li (2017) incorporated ridesharing into the bottleneck model for morning commute problem, and proposed a time-varying toll to eliminate the queue. Ma and Zhang (2017) studied the traffic flow patterns in a single bottleneck corridor with ridesharing program. Instead of recent paid ridesharing service, which allow travellers to be paired in real time, the traditional acquaintance-based carpooling is usually pre-arranged among families and friends. Literature about carpooling is also a valuable reference when considering modal choice and parking. Huang et al. (2000) presented deterministic and stochastic models to investigate how commuters choose from carpooling and driving alone modes. Xiao et al. (2016) optimized the lane capacity allocation in the morning commute problem with carpooling behaviour under parking space constraint.====It has been widely accepted that parking spaces are scarce resource in metropolises. A traveller usually has to spend roughly 30% of the travel time and €1 per day in cruising for a parking space (Shoup, 2006; Van Ommeren et al., 2011). The availability and accessibility of parking spaces may considerably influence commuters' travel behaviour (Albert & Mahalel, 2006; Yang et al., 2013). Thus it is of interest to investigate how parking would affect morning commuters’ travel mode and trip-timing decisions. Existing researches usually treated the parking availability as a physical restriction, and formulated the morning commute problem as bottleneck models with parking space constraints, e.g.,Yang et al. (2013); Xiao et al. (2016). However, the heterogeneity of parking spaces and preference of drivers were ignored in all these constrained models.====This study extends the existing work on morning commute problem with ridesharing by considering commuters' parking competition. We assume that each commuter prefers the parking spaces closer to the final destination and hence walks for a shorter time after parking. A new equilibrium model is established to describe commuters' travel mode and trip-timing choices, and competition on parking spaces. On this basis, two approaches are then introduced to mitigate congestion and improve the system performance. From the supply side, we propose an optimal parking density to balance commuters' travel cost and the construction cost of parking facilities. From the demand side, inspired by the fare-reward scheme in transit (Yang & Tang, 2018), we present a simple parking fee discount for ridesharing (PDR) scheme to encourage ridesharing participation in morning commute and consequently relieve congestion. The optimal PDR scheme aims to minimize system cost, subject to the constraints that commuters are not made worse off and the parking manager's revenues do not fall.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes a new bottleneck model with ridesharing and parking behaviour. The equilibrium condition is presented and the arrival order at the bottleneck is solved analytically. Section 3 proposes the optimal parking density to balance commuters' travel cost and parking owners’ construction cost. Section 4 introduces the PDR scheme and addresses the equilibrium solutions in the presence of the PDR scheme. The optimal PDR scheme is also presented. Section 5 concludes the paper.",Parking management in the morning commute problem with ridesharing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000093,9 February 2021,2021,Research Article,126.0

Additionally, the screening process for a US-bound CV (i.e., Mexico to the United States) is more complicated than the Mexico-bound process (Cornejo et al., 2017). A typical border crossing process at El Paso, Texas for US-bound CV/trucks involves: (i) random inspection by the Mexican customs agency (Aduana), (ii) toll payment to Mexican toll agency, (iii) inspections by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and (iv) inspection by Department of Public Safety (DPS) to ensure compliance with Texas motor vehicle safety standards and regulations. Fig. 1 illustrates these steps followed at US-Mexico border crossings and the location of Radio Frequency Identifiers (RFIDs) for calculating performance measures.====The performance of these border crossing is measured using two border crossing performance measures—wait time and crossing time. Wait time is the measurement of the time it takes for a vehicle to reach the CBP primary inspection booth after arriving at the queue's end. Crossing time is the time for a vehicle to exit the border crossing process after joining the queue before the DPS primary inspection booth (Fig. 1). Currently, these performance measures are reported using the Border Crossing Information System (BCIS) (====. BCIS is designed to provide a real-time and archived wait and crossing time information for US-bound CVs.====The two primary border crossings on the US-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas are Zaragoza (Ysleta-Zaragoza) and Bridge of the Americas (BOTA) (see Fig. 2). In addition to travel time performance measures through BCIS (wait time and crossing time), various new technologies have been investigated for reliable border traffic volume/counts at Zaragoza and BOTA in the last decade. Recently, LeddarTech™ Light-Emitting Diode Detection and Ranging (LEDDAR) scanner proved to provide accurate counts for commercial vehicles crossing the congested border. This was a significant development, as in the past, various technologies have failed to provide a reliable count, mainly because of queuing and overlap between axles/vehicle signatures. Further, LEDDAR can provide the CV counts at a similar resolution as wait time and crossing time from BCIS—this was not the case before.====At both these border crossings, some CVs have a permit that minimizes their wait time for inspections because of the trusted-traveler/trusted-shipper program known as the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program. The FAST is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico and allows expedited processing for CVs who have completed background checks and fulfill certain eligibility requirements. The CVs that do not have this permit are supposed to travel through non-FAST lanes and go through standard screening and checks. Recently BCIS was upgraded to obtain disaggregated wait time and crossing times for FAST and non-FAST lanes specifically for US-bound CVs.",Machine learning methods for commercial vehicle wait time prediction at a border crossing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921000068,8 February 2021,2021,Research Article,127.0

We have collected revealed and stated choice data and attitudinal data in order to investigate the mode of transport used before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. We studied the main choice determinants jointly with respondents’ psychological attitudes using an integrated choice/latent variable modelling framework. The model incorporates choice data, generalized cost variables, random parameters, and latent variables. The latter capture the concern for the environment, both at global and local level, the attitudes towards ==== and the Covid-19-related risks. The model is applied to assess the impact of extending the density of the cycling lanes on active mobility. Our estimates indicate a potential increase in cycling which, however, would not translate into an increase in active mobility, since the bike would substitute some trips currently made by foot. We also detect a high substitutability between the bike and the bus, while the motorcycle and the car are much less affected. It is confirmed that the Covid-19 pandemic altered significantly the transport mode choices, having a strong negative impact on bus and shifting bus users towards private modes, both motorized and non-motorized.","Cities are crucial for human development and agglomeration economies (Glaeser, 2011; Zheng et al., 2011). A proof of their importance is their continuous growth in both developing and developed countries, the two decades of the 21st century being not exception (Duranton & Puga, 2014). Transportation costs have been acknowledged to be a fundamental determinant of both the city size and its patterns of land use (Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1967; Muth, 1969). Since the late 19th century, a population shift from central urban areas into suburbs (suburbanization) has been taking place due to the dramatic decline in transportation costs, the advent of personal automobile after World War I and the growth in housing finance that made single-family houses affordable for a larger share of the population (Jackson et al., 1985). In parallel, historical city centers have declined since they were perceived as having obsolete housing and commercial structure. More recently, there has been a slowdown of decentralizing forces to the benefit of city centers both in the US (Acolin et al., 2016, pp. 2–10) and in Europe. In a service oriented economy, city centers have become increasingly attractive to young adults, retirees and immigrants (Voith & Wachter, 2009). In Europe, historical city centers are particularly relevant as a place of identity, memory and belonging (Ertan & Eğercioğlu, 2016); due to the still high number of commercial functions, offices, public buildings and historical monuments, city centers represent the economic and social core of a city. Consequently, many cities in Europe and around the world have increased their efforts to revitalize their historical city centers (Al-Hagla, 2007; Elnokaly, 2011; Ertan & Eğercioğlu, 2016). It is evident that the quality of the environment in urban areas is of vital importance and one of the main factors for their attractiveness. One of the key factors hindering the attractiveness of city centers is motorized traffic, with its associated poor air quality, unacceptable levels of noise, visual intrusion and congestion. The challenge for city authorities is to develop traffic management techniques and approaches that promote less intrusive modes of transport, and many European cities have already made huge progress as documented by a handbook published by the European Union (European Commission, 2004).====The active modes==== of transport such as walking and cycling could help achieving the goal of revitalizing the historical city centers and enhance their attractiveness. A high share of active modes within the historical city centers has many potential benefits both at individual and system level. At individual level, walking and cycling provide opportunities to exercise and keep healthy. It is documented that walking and cycling reduce the risk of a variety of long-term conditions including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity and diabetes (Beaglehole et al., 2011; Hamer & Chida, 2008). At system level, non-motorized travel modes increase the overall sustainability, containing air and noise emissions and traffic congestion. Since half of all journeys in urban areas are less than 5 km long and a third are less than 3 km (European Commission, 2004), walking and cycling may play a major role in accessing locations within the city centers.====The paper investigates the choice of the mode of transport to access the historical center of an Italian city. As a case study, we have selected the city of Trieste, a medium-sized city located in the northeastern border of Italy, where the authors of this study work and reside. In Italy urban trips are performed 31.5% by foot, 7.1% by bike, 52.1% by private motorized modes (car and motorcycles), and 9.3% by bus (ISFORT, 2018). Trieste has a much higher bus share (27%), a similar walking share (31.2%) but a much lower cycling share (2%), mostly likely due to the higher share of elderly population and to the hilly nature of some parts of the city which makes it difficult to cycle with regular bikes. Compared to previous years, the share of active mobility is rising, but relative to some countries like the Netherlands and Denmark (Copenhagen's bicycle share was 27% in the period 2011–13; Haustein et al., 2020), much progress could be still made especially concerning bike use.====The recent Covid-19 pandemic is having serious repercussions on the transport sector and mobility. Containment policies aimed at contrasting the spread of the disease have locked most of the population at home, causing significant repercussions on the demand and supply for services with a stronger impact on passenger mobility. As a consequence, many externalities normally associated with motorized transport modes, as journey times, accidents, congestion and pollution radically decreased (Aloi et al., 2020). Public transport systems have been the most negatively affected. Public transit usage declined by 90% in Italy and France, 85% in Spain, 75% in the United Kingdom and 70% in Germany, with some variability across cities (Falchetta & Noussan, 2020), due to both the users’ fear of contagion and the recommendations of health authorities to avoid using public transport. This might result either in an increase in the motorized modes (car and motorcycles), thus causing an increase of congestion and air pollution, or in an increase of active mobility, depending on the available infrastructure and on the existing regulatory and traffic policies. In fact, several Italian cities, such as Rome and Milan, accelerated the construction of (temporary) bicycle lanes and strengthened the supply of bike-sharing systems. So far, the city of Trieste has kept unaltered the supply of cycling lanes, while the bike-sharing system became available, coincidentally, just before the beginning of the lockdown period.====Making use of the CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing) methodology, we have investigated the choice of the mode of transport to reach the Trieste city center made by a sample of 315 respondents before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since it is widely recognized in the literature that mode choice depends on observable characteristics of the transport modes and of the decision maker and on unobservable characteristics (latent variables), we have adopted an integrated choice/latent variable modelling framework (McFadden, 1986; Ben-Akiva et al., 2002; Bolduc et al., 2005). The model incorporates revealed and stated preference data, random parameters accounting for preference heterogeneity, and latent variables. We have considered 4 latent variables: concern for the global environment, concern for the local environment, attitude towards physical exercise and attitude towards Covid-19-related risks. We have then applied the estimated model to assess the impact of the increase in the number of cycling lanes on active travel towards the city center of Trieste. The results indicate potentially high increases in cycling but with non-negligible substitution effects for walking and bus use.====Section 2 describes the related literature.

After a review of the differing performance of the three phases of expansion by Chicago's Divvy bikeshare system, this study uses multivariate adaptive regression splining (MARS) to select among more than 100 community- and station-level factors to explain variations in Divvy system usage at the station level. MARS demonstrates that neighborhood racial and ethnic diversity, proportion of condominium units, and job accessibility to public transit are strongly and positively correlated with total annual station trips, whereas percentage unemployed, average distance to Divvy stations, and percentage of residential foreclosures are negatively correlated. Model results are compared with those of earlier studies to foster insights into ways to more accurately predict the use of bikesharing systems across urban neighborhoods.","Over the past several years, city planners have increasingly made the case that active transportation can contribute positively to the safety, health, and attractiveness of urban places (Beatley, 1999; McCann, 2013; Speck, 2018; Wolfe, 2013). Yet a growing body of research shows that the utilization of non-motorized modes of transportation can differ in systematic ways between cities, neighborhoods and even across categories of travelers (Kim & Ulfarsson, 2008; Schiller, Kenworthy, and Kenworthy 2017; Schneider, 2013). Observed frequencies in bicycling, for example, have shown to vary with respect to a wide range of inter-related economic, social and environmental factors such as transportation cost (Sheller, 2015), convenience (Fishman, 2014), mode familiarity (Schoner et al., 2016), land use patterns (Zahabi et al., 2016), public transport integration (Tran, Ovtracht, and D'arcier 2015), perceived safety (Aziz et al., 2017), weather (Gebhart & Noland, 2014), topography (Rudloff & Lackner, 2014) as well as investments in education and access programs (Pucher et al., 2010).====In the early 2010s, the development, adoption and expansion of information technology-based public bicycle sharing systems, which make bicycles available to the public on an as-needed basis, was seen as a viable strategy for increasing active transportation movements within US cities (Midgley, 2011; Shaheen et al., 2014). The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) estimated that riders took 36.5 million station-based bikeshare trips across the US in 2018, up nine percent over the previous year (NACTO 2019). However, as city budgets tighten and the usage of public bikesharing systems and other micromobility options (e.g., dockless bikes and e-scooters) ebb and flow, the once widespread optimism that conventional, dock-based bikeshare will ultimately improve public health and diversify urban travel shows signs of easing (Bauman et al., 2017). In response, city planners, mobility companies and transportation researchers are seeking out evidence-based strategies to incrementally improve the equity and effectiveness of such systems. Critical to this effort is a nuance understanding of how particular contextual factors affect system ridership.====Toward this end, the present study builds on previous work to develop a series of statistical models that help explain subtle variations in public bikeshare usage within the city of Chicago. The article begins with a brief summary of public bikeshare planning research with special attention paid to the various analytical strategies employed to evaluate system performance. The authors then layout an alternative multivariate adaptive regression splining (Friedman, 1991) or MARS-based approach for examining variations in bikeshare usage at the station level, using Chicago's Divvy system as a case study.

Hence, in most cases road continues to be the preferred solution. This condition is valid especially in the Alps, due to its morphological and infrastructural characteristics. To increase the attractiveness of CT in the Alpine context, this paper discusses the appropriateness of introducing a “small-scale corridor terminals” scheme along Brenner, i.e. the transalpine axis with the highest freight volumes, by assessing the opportunity of a new intermodal terminal in the Italian region of South Tyrol as part of an integrated system. The expectations of local firms and the development of alternative scenarios indicate that the geographical distribution is fragmented, and the potential demand is currently not sufficient to justify an investment with public funds. Thus, the proposed scheme seems not suitable for this context. At the same time, our analysis underscores the need to implement other policies to reorganise the freight movement at Brenner. An effective coordination with the neighbouring and underused terminal of Trento may be a first step towards this goal.","In the EU-28, the road component counts for about 83% of all transport externalities, generating damage quantified at 4.8% of the continental Gross Domestic Product (GDP; EC, 2019a). Road freight transport contributes to this condition, since at the EU level represent about 75% of overall freight transport (Eurostat, 2018) and its costs are more than three times higher than rail (EC, 2019a). The shift of goods from road to rail can reduce its negative impacts without curbing mobility. Combined Transport (CT) is recognised as a possible solution to encourage this modal shift. CT refers to the intermodal transport where the major part of the journey is by railway and any initial and/or final legs carried out by road are as short as possible (UN/ECE Economic Commission for Europe United Nations, 2001). Ideally, this service merges the strengths of road and rail, using the area-wide flexibility of the trucks combined with the reliability and the economies of the train on medium and long journeys. In practice, several aspects prevent this from being diffused: it may be more expensive than road transport especially in the first and last-mile legs, total travel times are normally higher, and flexibility is lower (Nocera et al., 2020; Troch et al., 2015).====Alpine areas suffer more than other contexts from transport externalities, due to their morphological and topographic conditions, characterised by narrow valleys and settlements located near the infrastructural corridors. Here, effects of transport externalities can be up to five times higher than in flat lands (Sutter et al., 2017). For such reasons, developing an attractive CT option is set as one of the priorities by EUSALP, the macro-regional strategy for the Alps (EUSALP, 2019). Currently, more than 73% of transalpine freight transport is performed by road-only services and CT is limited to 20% (Lückge et al., 2019), thus preventing a more balanced development of the transalpine mobility.====In the alpine area, some high speed/high capacity (HS/HC) railway lines are under development in the framework of the TEN-T program (EC, 2019b), which identifies the most important transnational corridors where the movement of passengers and freight should be concentrated. TEN-T network has the primary objective of linking the main European cities and metropolitan areas, by providing a competitive and reliable transport infrastructure. However, this network may have relevant implications also for those non-metropolitan areas that are located along the infrastructure, according to the conceptual scheme called “small-scale corridor terminals” (Woxenius, 1997). This scheme has been already assessed for sea-rail transport (e.g., Eger et al., 2003; Kreutzberger and Konings, 2016; Šakalys & Batarlienė, 2017). However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been discussed for land transport (rail + road). Indeed, this form of combined transport may be very different in terms of handled volumes, technologies and stakeholders that are involved in the whole chain. The Alpine context represents an ideal location to test the validity of this scheme, due to the high environmental and social pressures presented above and to the morphology of its territory, crossed by few main infrastructural axes.====The success of this initiative is ultimately decided by those stakeholders that are supposed to use these infrastructures and is based on market and policy-driven mechanisms that are related not only to their location (Cavallaro et al., 2020). The expectations of local stakeholders are essential to define the most appropriate solutions for achieving a modal shift towards rail (Cappelli & Nocera, 2006), here including the construction of a new intermodal terminal in non-metropolitan areas.====This paper discusses the efficiency of the “small-scale corridor terminals” layout along the Brenner corridor, which is the transalpine corridor with the highest traffic volumes (Nocera et al., 2018). The analysis is focussed on South Tyrol (ST), i.e. the Italian Autonomous Province with the highest GDP, which does not have its intermodal terminal – unique region among those crossed by the corridor. Indeed, only with the introduction of such an infrastructure in ST the proposed scheme could become operative. To this aim, the point of view of local firms about the introduction of a new intermodal terminal along the Brenner corridor is presented. The volumes of those firms in favour of the terminal are adopted to design alternative scenarios that can verify whether a technical and economic feasibility analysis for a terminal in ST is justified or not. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the theoretical framework related to intermodal terminals that will be used in the paper. Section 3 describes the Brenner corridor and its infrastructural equipment, focussing on ST. Section 4 describes the methodology adopted in order to understand stakeholders’ perception about a new intermodal terminal in ST.

Such impacts translate into measurable health outcomes inherent to life expectancy as well as mortality and morbidity outcomes related to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, accidents, mental health, and citizen's quality of life. Coherently with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the new version of the European Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) Guidelines features a topic guide linking transport and health. This paper assesses the inclusion of health provisions and methodologies in urban mobility policy and planning documents of four European cities using a multi-level perspective. It considers the adoption of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) tools to integrate health evidence, objectives and measures in the decision-making process. The establishment of a link between active mobility and environmental risk reduction is observed across the countries analyzed. HIAs have been carried out to evaluate the benefits of mobility measures on health only in some cases.","Since the formulation of the notion of Healthy Public Policies by the global public health community (WHO, 1988, pp. 5–9), the impact of non-health public policies on social determinants of health and health outcomes has been progressively brought forward. According to Dahlgren and Whitehead (1991) social determinants of health (SDoHs) are all the living and working conditions, both physical and social, that affect health behaviors, opportunities and environmental exposures of individuals and communities (Fig. 1). Housing, education, employment, social networks, and infrastructures are social determinants of health since they determine the individual's choices and opportunities relevant for health: physical activity, diet, and access to healthcare resources to name a few. Housing, education, employment, social networks, and infrastructures also determine exposure to environmental, social, and occupational hazards, such as pollution, violence, or accidents. According to the SDoHs framework, social and environmental factors are more important in predicting population mortality and morbidity risks than genetic factors, for this reason they should be considered when formulating all kind of public policy. SDoHs are not equally distributed; it is hence an objective of health policy to address inequalities in the SDoHs as well as to make sure that working and living conditions are conducive to improve population health (Graham, 2004).====Transportation and mobility fit within the living and working conditions axis of the framework of SDoHs. Widespread, accessible and affordable public transportation translate to greater opportunities for citizens to access work and education facilities, social networks, and health services thus lowering social and health inequality (Gorman et al., 2003; Hernandez, 2017; Lucas, 2012). Territories that are built to favor public transportation as opposed to private vehicles have more green spaces, and stricter speed limits (Albalate & Fageda, 2019; Kenworthy, 2006). This translates into lower air and acoustic pollution, greater opportunities for social interaction and the lowering of road accidents, with measurable benefits in terms of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, accidents, mental health hazards, and, overall citizen's quality of life (Cepeda et al., 2016; Hausler, Delmelle, Keul, Blaschke, & Prinz, 2015; Litman, 2013).====Active mobility presents additional opportunities in terms of both sustainability and health outcomes. Active mobility defines walking and cycling for transport purposes, solely or in combined multimodal trips (Wegener et al., 2017). Active mobility additionally supports health objectives by fostering greater physical activity via walking and cycling (de Nazelle et al., 2011; Wegener et al., 2017). The fostering of greater physical activity is crucial in contemporary societies as WHO has indicated physical inactivity as one of the four avoidable risk factors (together with tobacco use, unhealthy diet and harmful use of alcohol) leading to the main non-communicable diseases (NCDs) of our era: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. The world's main NCDs account for approximately 71% of the global burden of disease (WHO, 2020). The potential for active mobility to leave individuals more exposed to UV radiation, air pollution, and road accidents has been reviewed in literature with results concluding that the benefits of active travel outweigh its risks (De Hartog et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2015).====Health Impacts Assessment (HIA) is one of the main approaches used in research and practice to ascertain the impacts of policy-making on health determinants and outcome. HIA has been identified by WHO as a tool to promote public health across different policy areas (Ståhl et al., 2006; WHO, 1999). It is an approach that intends to prospectively assess the potential effects of public policy on population health by quantifying outcomes in a benefit-risk reciprocation perspective. There is no standard approach to HIA; HIA can include qualitative or quantitative evidence, draw on scientific data and/or feedback from the public, and is a participatory approach in what it allows different stakeholders to be included in the decision-making process (Fig. 2). The HIA approach determines if the decision-making process is relevant for health outcomes, pinpoints main health impacts, proceeds to an assessment of the impacts via the best available evidence, and provides recommendations and guidelines for action.====As indicated by Khreis et al. (2017), different tools derived from HIA have been applied to the field of active travel policies: the Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT), Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool (ITHIM), the Transportation, Air pollution and Physical Activities (TAPAS) model, and the Urban and Transport Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) model. The majority of these tools have been mainly used within the academic realm, although HEAT has proven to be applied also in practice (Kahlmeier et al., 2017).====Different studies have insofar tried to assess the impact of transportation policies on health outcomes, helping shape the field of study as well as of supporting evidence-based decision-making (de Nazelle et al., 2011; Khreis et al., 2017; Thomson et al., 2008). Although both WHO and the scientific community have constantly argued for the impact of public and transportation policies on health, to this day few studies have focused on empirically analyzing to what extent health objectives and methodologies have been integrated into transportation planning. This article intends to tackle this gap by analyzing the consideration of health objectives and the inclusion of recommended health-assessment methodologies (HIA and HEAT) in active policy formulation within the EU. The analysis starts from the EU transport policy framework, reference for all EU member states, and then looks at how such framework was translated both nationally and locally by four countries – France, Italy, Portugal and UK==== – and their respective capitals Paris, Rome, Lisbon and London. By looking at the inclusion of health objectives in different contexts the authors aim to gain a comprehensive insight on which health objectives are tackled and which overlooked, and furthering the discussion on how transportation policy can better support health objectives, resulting in an equitable, sustainable and cost-effective way to enhance public health. Furthermore, the article aims to analyze the differences and similarities in the way European active mobility guidelines and impacts assessment methodologies are applied nationally and locally. This will allow pinpointing best practices, identifying gaps and providing recommendations on how transportation policy can better support health objectives.",Health considerations in active travel policies: A policy analysis at the EU level and of four member countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920302043,30 January 2021,2021,Research Article,131.0

We develop a detailed ==== (TCO) model incorporating all relevant costs with special attention to account for variations in engine efficiency between urban and sub-urban trips and by seasons of the year. The model generates two metrics: the threshold purchase price and the threshold annual distance travelled, which are used to compare among propulsion systems and to perform policy scenarios. The model is applied to a large selection of LCVs models available in Europe as of June 2019. We find that eLCVs have on average a higher TCO/km than their conventional counterparts. Yet, the existing offer of eLCVs is differentiated and some eLCV models are cost competitive. We find that four eLCV models belonging to the city and panel segments are convenient relative to their diesel counterparts for daily distances travelled lower than 93 km. Nonetheless, with financial and regulatory incentives, 100% urban driving, and 100% home/depot charging, most of the existing city and panel eLCV models are cost competitive with respect to both their diesel and petrol counterparts.","The European strategy for low-emission mobility (European Commission, 2016) explicitly mentions the transition towards low- and zero-emission vehicles to reach the ambitious environmental mitigation targets. Electric vehicles are considered a promising alternative to the conventional internal combustion engine ones, both for passenger and freight transport (Ahmadi, 2019).====The focus of this paper is on light commercial vehicles (LCVs, also referred to as “vans”),==== and more specifically on electric LCVs (eLCVs), a market segment under-researched relative to electric cars, although very relevant in terms of traffic. In fact, LCVs are key players in the logistics chain, enabling the “last mile” delivery of goods in urban areas since, according to Transmodal (2012) and Russo and Comi (2012), urban freight vehicles account for 6–18% of total urban transport in the European Union member states. Recent estimates for the UK reveal that LCVs account for 15.4% of all traffic. Transport for London points out that LCVs make up over 20% of London traffic in the morning peaks (8.00a.m.–9.00a.m.) (SMMT, 2019). They are largely used by small and medium-sized enterprises as business tools, contributing to boost the urban economy. LCVs are useful to carry out a broad range of activities such as construction, postal and courier services, mobile workshops, taxi and artisan services. Their size, versatility and flexibility make them particularly popular. Electronic commerce multiplies small point-to-point deliveries, requiring an increasing number of LCVs. In Europe, recent statistics by ACEA – European Automobile Manufacturers Association (2017) show that there are some 29 million LCVs on the EU roads, assembled in 39 LCV assembly plants. In 2018, 2.02 million LCVs were sold. In 2017, Ford was the best-selling brand in the European LCV market, followed by Renault, Volkswagen, Peugeot, Citroen, Mercedes-Benz and Fiat.====eLCVs could contribute to a cleaner urban goods distribution (Camilleri & Dablanc, 2017; de Mello Bandeira et al., 2019; Perboli & Rosano, 2019). Lee et al. (2013) found that in a drive cycle with frequent stops and low average speed, electric trucks emit 42–61% less greenhouse gases and consume 32–54% less energy than diesel trucks. Giordano et al. (2018) performed a life-cycle analysis and compare the diesel and electric versions of the Iveco 5-ton Daily 50C van. They performed an environmental and economic comparison considering 5 cities: Berlin, Oslo, Rome, Lisbon, and London. They confirmed that eLCVs reduce CO==== emissions by 93–98% and air pollutant emissions (NO====, PM====, PM====, SO====) by 85–99%. Marmiroli et al. (2020) performed a comparative life cycle assessment of electric, compressed natural gas and diesel light-duty vehicles and found that the electric vehicle performs better than the conventional ones in four out of eight of the analyzed impact categories even in a country like Italy where electricity production is still mainly based on fossil fuels. Furthermore, eLCVs could contribute to decrease noise emissions, a very relevant factor in urban goods distribution (Campello-Vicente et al., 2017). For instance, Ibarra et al. (2017) carried out tests under real driving conditions in suburban and urban roads in the south of Mexico City and found that electric engines have made important contributions towards reducing engine noise in suburban and urban traffic, at least 10 dBA less than diesel or petrol vehicles.====Despite their environmental advantages, their current market share is still very limited and making little progress over the recent years (Iwan et al., 2019). The most recent data on market shares by fuel type for LCVs (ACEA - European Automobile Manufacturers Association, 2018a) show that diesel engines are still dominating this market (89.9%), followed by petrol (7.7%), liquid propane gas (LPG)/compressed natural gas (CNG) (1.2%), electric (0.2%) and others (1%). France is one of the countries where the eLCVs uptake is larger. In France, in 2018, the following eLCVs were sold: 4176 Renault Kangoo Z.E., 469 Peugeot Partner, 637 Nissan e-NV200, 603 Goupil G4, and 526 Citroen Berlingo. Overall, the eLCV market increased by a promising 34% with 8103 new registrations, with a market share of 1.77%.====LCV purchasing decision is affected by many attributes whose relative importance can be assessed via a variety of techniques, including conjoint-based studies, stated choice experiments and multiple regression analyses. Although eLCV purchasing decisions have been researched much less than electric cars choice decisions, the existing studies (Lebeau et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) find that, similarly to cars, driving range and purchase price play a relevant role. Christensen et al. (2017) collected data on daily mileage in different commercial sectors and concluded that construction, human health and other service sectors are the most suitable ones because they present a reasonably low daily mileage. To overcome the range issue, they suggested keeping a few conventional cars in the fleet that can be used for extra-long trips. Alternative options are to recharge eLCVs during the day, either with a fast-charging facility ==== or by the customer. Figenbaum (2018) focused on the specific segment of “craftsmen and service enterprises” transportation in Norway, one of the most eLCV friendly country in the world. He found that if all year range increases to 200 km, then almost all vehicles are potentially replaceable. Purchase incentives, however, are required, but may not produce large effects until the driving range improves. Morganti and Browne (2018) conducted experiment-oriented interviews with urban freight transport and service operators who tested and adopted eLCVs, exploring technical and operational obstacles in daily operations in Paris and London. They found that, in addition to range issues, last mile operators’ perception and acceptance of eLCVs are affected by concerns, such as queue, payload and grid anxieties. Encouragingly, Wolff and Madlener (2019) reported that the Deutsche Post drivers are slightly more satisfied with the eLCVs than with the conventional ones.====ACEA - European Automobile Manufacturers Association (2018b) argues that the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) plays a decisive role in firms' decisions. eLCVs are hardly chosen if they do not positively contribute to generate profits. Firms are very cost-sensitive, differently from car owners who might value more aesthetics, performance or normative conformity (Cherchi, 2017). In a pioneering study, Feng and Figliozzi (2013) developed a fleet replacement optimization model considering an electric and a conventional truck. They found that electric trucks are competitive only with high utilization: the threshold point is estimated around 45,000 km per year per truck. Tanco et al. (2019) performed a threshold analysis for battery electric trucks in Latin America, finding that the penetration follows the weight classes: the light-duty trucks have the best chances, followed by the medium-duty and high-duty ones. Teoh et al. (2018) evaluated four opportunity charging strategies - during breaks and shift changes, loading and unloading activities or while driving on highways - with the aim of reducing their costs. Lebeau et al. (2015) developed a TCO model to assess the competitiveness of quadricycles and LCVs for freight transport companies. They found that battery electric vehicles are competitive with petrol ones but not yet with diesel vehicles. Performing a sensitivity analysis, they found that eLCVs cost-competitiveness might increase depending on their utilization, future market conditions and government support. Taefi et al. (2016) undertook a multi-criteria analysis of policy measures based on the rating by two stakeholder groups: policymakers and freight electric vehicle users. They found that the discordance between the groups can be large. Financial support of eLCV acquisition is often mentioned, while other policies such as regulatory, organization and information measures tend to be overlooked. Mirhedayatian and Yan (2018) found that a zone fee can increase the company's total logistic costs but improve the social welfare, particularly inside congestion/low-emission zones with a high population, dense pollution, and heavy traffic. Their results showed that vehicle taxes and subsidies have the same influence on the company and society, although with different effects considering low tax/subsidy rates. Lebeau et al. (2019) discussed how to improve the TCO of eLCVs with specific reference to the Brussels-Capital Region. They found that eLCVs compete with their conventional versions as they weigh less and need therefore smaller and less expensive batteries. The heavier the electric vehicle becomes, however, the more difficult their competitive position becomes with their conventional versions. They suggested that optimizing the usage of the vehicle and the ownership time can improve their TCO. As a policy recommendation, they proposed a more sustainable fiscal system and a kilometer-based charge.====Most of the literature we have reviewed approaches the LCV acquisition issue from the point of view of an individual and our proposed methodology assumes the same approach. An alternative would be to approach the issue from the point of view of a fleet manager having to optimize the fleet composition by size and propulsion system. In such a case there would be similarities with the bus acquisition and management literature (Lajunen, 2014; Miles & Potter, 2014).====In this paper, building on the previous literature, we focus on the eLCV cost-competitiveness by developing a TCO model to compare 46 LCVs, available in Europe, with different propulsion systems. We calibrate the model by using Italian data and use as a metric the threshold eLCV price, i.e. the eLCV purchase price that would make them cost-competitive (in terms of TCO) with internal combustion engine LCVs. In order to assure proper comparability, we classified LCVs into three main segments: city, panel and box ones. We then conduct a sensitivity analysis to estimate the effect on our results of changes in the annual distance travelled, in the holding period and resale value, in the percentage of urban/sub-urban trips, and in purchase price, discounts and subsidies. We finally evaluate the impact of two policy scenarios enacted at the urban level: a) a €6000 purchase subsidy; and b) in addition to the subsidy an access fee levied on internal combustion engine LCVs (hereafter, ICE LCVs). The results allow us to discuss the potential of eLCV uptake in Europe and the effectiveness of eLCV incentivizing measures.====This paper contributes to the existing literature by:====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the TCO model and the threshold eLCV purchase price metric; Section 3 describes the selected LCV models; Section 4 illustrates the model parameters.

The aim of this paper is to examine such collisions between 2004 and 2018 and determine the characteristics of accident and injury risk for ,"Walking is the most basic form of mobility and is categorised as active travel (Jones & Ogilvie, 2012). It contributes to health benefits that are related to physiological aspects (e.g. disease prevention), environmental aspects (e.g. less pollution) (De Nazelle et al., 2011), and economic aspects (e.g. reduction in premature deaths with large health savings) (Sælensminde, 2004). The health benefits, however, are overshadowed by road injury accidents, which pose a threat to pedestrians considered the most vulnerable user group in the transport system. Pedestrians are generally unprotected in the road space, they are light and travel at low speeds (Moudon et al., 2011). These elements of vulnerability put pedestrians at maximum risk when compared to other road users (Casado-Sanz et al., 2019).====Active travellers, including pedestrians, represent 26% of fatalities globally (World Health Organisation, 2018). Within the European Union (EU) 21% of road fatalities are pedestrians. In the decade between 2007 and 2016 such fatalities were reduced by 36% across the EU. Yet Malta is one of the few member states that until 2016 had an increase in pedestrian fatalities (European Commission, 2018). When compared to other EU countries, Malta ranked seventh place with 17.8 pedestrian fatalities per million population. The EU average for 2016 was 10.6 pedestrian fatalities per million population and Romania had the highest rate (36.3 pedestrian fatalities per million population) (European Commission, 2018). The EU aimed to have close to zero fatalities in road transport by 2050 and half the road casualties by 2020 (European Commission, 2011). However, it has been observed that the reduction rates did not reach the intended targets and the number of fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians are still a cause for concern (The Council of Europe, 2017).====This study contributes to this discussion by providing an alternative analysis of pedestrian road traffic injury accidents in Malta. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the extended form of the analytical method that we use in this study (the Multiple Correspondence Analysis, followed by a Cluster Analysis and geovisualised using Kernel Density Estimation) is innovative in the field of road traffic injury accidents that focuses on pedestrians. The aim of this study is to examine pedestrian road traffic injury accidents in Malta over a 15-year period (between 2004 and 2018) and determine the characteristics that contribute to risk for pedestrians in the road environment. The objectives are to (i) create a typology of accidents through attribute and spatial patterns visible in the time-series data; and (ii) identify determinants of injury accidents and areas with a high risk for pedestrian injury in the Maltese context. The analytical methodology is inspired by the works of Fontaine and Gourlet (1997) and Mabunda et al. (2008).====The paper will develop as follows. Section 2 consists of the literature review, which will discuss the determinants of road traffic injury accidents and determinants that contribute to risks for pedestrian injury in road environments.

The consequences of pollution are increasingly evident, and transport, being one of the main sources of congestion and pollution, is cited as the major culprit. In this context and as one of the few positive externalities of the COVID-19 pandemic, micro-mobility and, more generally, environmentally friendly and co-managed mobility, are gaining ground. In particular, bike-sharing has seen double-digit growth rates of diffusion and use in its various forms. It is a fast and efficient solution, with zero emissions, convenience, speed of movement for short distances and beneficial effects on users' health. However, its use is still rather limited in Italian cities. Through an online survey conducted at the national level in 2020, we shed light on the elements that determine the adoption of bike-sharing among potential users. Through factor analysis, ordered logit and ====, we have identified the factors that facilitate the extensive adoption of this service. In addition, we have seen how consumers’ habits have changed, comparing them in the pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown periods and highlighting the health benefits for both potential and current users. The results and policy implications could be useful for local regulators and bike-sharing scheme operators.","Climate change awareness has rapidly increased in recent years. The deleterious consequences of pollution have become evident to the general community, with transport having been identified as one of the main sources of congestion and pollution====. ====This sector accounts for 27% of the European Union's total CO==== emissions. In 2016, it produced at a worldwide level 2748 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), which is almost 28% of the total final consumption (Noussan, Carioni, Sanvito, & Colombo, 2019). Cars and vans are responsible for two-thirds of the total emissions (EEA, 2016; Intini & Percoco, 2021). In this context, mobility-related activities are deemed to play a major role in generating environmental impacts (Dizdaroglu and Yigitcanlar, 2016). The overall cost that this sector accrued for the EU is estimated at €987 billion: 44% to solve environment-related problems, 29% for road accidents and 27% to address congestion issues (European Commission, 2019). Pollution reduction in the transport sector can be optimised through measures that include reducing demand, switching to more efficient modes of transport and improving vehicle and fuel performance (Gota et al., 2019). For these reasons, promoting sustainable transport activities as part of the sustainable urban development movement has become a priority policy issue for many cities and countries all over the world (Ambrosino et al., 2016).====Another concern is gaining ground in the definition of urban transport policies: the sedentary lifestyle. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2019), empirical evidence shows that to date, about 1%–3% of the national health expenditure in developed countries is attributable to problems generated by physical inactivity. According to the WHO, more than 60%–70% of the world's population in the past 10 years has been doing less than 150 min of moderate physical activity per week. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 and the sudden change in lifestyle habits linked to the lockdown have increased the attention accorded to the problem in many developed countries.====Finally, health concerns related to COVID-19 infection and problems of contagion in crowded spaces and transport means have led to a complete rethinking of the use of public transport and, thus, the role of private and individual mobility services.====Given these concerns, the focus on healthy and environmentally friendly mobility solutions has significantly increased in the last decades (Bergantino & Catalano, 2016) and, in many southern European countries where sedentary lifestyle is a greater concern, COVID-19 has been an accelerator.====The combination of mobility and physical activity is cheap and does not require major skills, making it suitable for large segments of the population (Götschi et al., 2016). Biking and bike-sharing systems have been proposed as an effective solution for the resolution of both issues (Bergantino et al., 2020; Buongiorno & Intini, 2021). In particular, the bike-sharing scheme has progressively been viewed as a more cost-efficient substitute for traditional fossil fuel-based transport for short trips of between 1 and 5 km (Curran, 2008). It also significantly reduces environmental problems due to transport emissions (Bergantino et al., 2020; Buongiorno & Intini, 2021; Cheng et al., 2019; Maas & Attard, 2020; Shaheen & Guzman, 2011). Mason et al. (2015) estimated potential savings amounting to $24 trillion dollars between 2015 and 2050 associated with a reduction of 11% in CO==== emission due to people switching from private motorised transport to biking, resulting in a decrease in energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and private costs to travellers.====Furthermore, biking is a form of physical activity, which means that an additional benefit derived from it is the improvement of public health (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2011). Specifically, it reduces the risk of diabetes, specific forms of cancer, obesity and other diseases. De Hartog et al. (2010) observed that for every half million people in the Netherlands who use a bike instead of a car, the life expectancy is increased by 3–14 months. On the contrary, inhaled air pollution and bike accident risks cause a decrease of 0.8–14 days and 5–9 days, respectively.====In this context, cycling and bike-sharing are modes of transport that have garnered a new and prestigious reputation (Gutiérrez et al., 2020). Bike-sharing is characterised by a set of bike stations distributed in a certain area and made available to users. Users can borrow a bike from a dock station and return it at another one that belongs to the same system (Hu et al., 2019) or they can just unlock a bike through an app and leave it in a different part of the city (i.e., dockless bike-sharing system). One of the main advantages of this system is ubiquity: users can access the service anytime and anywhere. Statistically, bike-sharing programmes grew from 5 in 2005 to 1571 in 2018 (Hosford, 2019), with about 20–22 million dockless and docked bikes all over the world (Schmidt, 2018). The construction of docking stations and kiosk machines requires an upfront investment but local governments are often likely to support this programme (Efthymiou et al., 2013).====In Europe, however, the use of bikes and bike-sharing schemes is still relatively limited (Ambrosino et al., 2016). According to an EU-wide survey conducted in 2014, about 8% of Europeans use the bike as their preferred mode of transport on a typical day====. ====The number and the usage of bicycles differ from country to country. Some cyclists use it every day as a means of transport, while others do it only occasionally (ECMT, 2000). Survey data from a selection of seven European countries show that for short trips under 5 km, the share of cycling varies from 12% (Finland) to 39% (Netherlands). The average trip length for cycling is around 3 km in several European countries. Most Italian, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese cities have not seriously included cycling in their urban transport plans, leading to irregular and not always positive results (Marques et al., 2015). According to Festa and Forciniti (2019), Italy is just below the European average, with 6% urban cyclists. However, it is performing better than France and Spain. The European Commission's efforts to tackle the new mobility challenges linked with connected and autonomous mobility and zero-emission transport are growing. In 2019, about €15 billion were devoted to measures linked with mobility, energy and climate in the Horizon Europe Programme post-2020====.==== According to Cheng et al. (2019), some obstacles remain. Concerns relating to safety, privacy leakage and other factors are perceived as impediments to its diffusion. Moreover, digitalisation plays a crucial role in the future outlook of the sector. Due to limited access to urban cycling information, cities encounter difficulties in effectively developing new dedicated infrastructures and in promoting cycling (Gössling, 2017; Pajarito et al., 2018). The integrated schemes of ticketing, fares and service information, as well as service and physical coordination, are some of the challenges that bike-sharing systems will face (Veryard et al., 2017). The COVID-19 pandemic has changed these numbers, with an increase in the use of biking and other non-motorised means of transport during the pandemic; this practice persisted even after the removal of the measures associated with the lockdown. In Italy, ISFORT (2020) found that although non-motorised mobility (walking, cycling, mopeds and other non-motorised means of transport) has lost some footing in favour of private motorised transport after the expiry of the lockdown, it maintains a much higher share of trips served than in 2019 (about 35%).====In this paper, using an online survey conducted nationwide in 2020, we shed light on the elements that determine the adoption of bike-sharing among potential users in Italian cities, with a special focus on the cities that have not introduced the bike-sharing system yet. The aim is to identify how to create and improve sustainable mobility systems and infrastructures related to bike-sharing. We contribute to the literature by explaining the different behaviours and preferences of potential users by analysing their propensity with respect to physical activity and cycling. Recognising that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown might have played a relevant role in the formation of preferences, we carry out an ex-ante and ex-post lockdown analysis. Non-motorised mobility (walking, cycling and other non-motorised means of transport) has lost some footing towards the expiry of the lockdown (in favour of private motorised transport) but keeps a much higher share of trips served than in 2019 (about 35%) (ISFORT, 2020).====Furthermore, we focus on the health perceptions of users to understand the communication policies that local managers and regulators must face to make the service increasingly attractive. Many papers have analysed the factors related to bike-sharing systems and the health impacts of bike-sharing usage in general and the Italian context in particular. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have focused on these factors in cities where bike-sharing mobility systems are yet to be introduced.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We discuss in Section 2 the related literature on bike-sharing systems, focusing as well on the effects of this system on users’ health.

Walking brings several benefits to inhabitants among money savings and health improvement. Unfortunately, despite its benefits, walking is not a priority in the urban planning agenda of some cities, especially in the Global South. Walkability conditions in some areas of these cities are not particularly friendly for ====, which discourage walking trips and promotes inequities across inhabitants. Evidence supporting ==== in the provision of adequate conditions for the use of active transport in the Global South cities remain scarce. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap by first proposing a framework to link pedestrian accessibility with walkability measures. Specifically, we use a macro-scale measure of pedestrian accessibility and a meso-scale measure of walkability to compare walking conditions on different zones in Barranquilla and Soledad, Colombia. After comparing both measures, we found that low-income zones have higher walkability indexes but present lower potential pedestrian accessibility. In contrast, the highest potential pedestrian accessibilities were located in high and medium-income zones, where people rely more on private transport modes. This imbalance regarding supply and demand conditions for walking trips suggest that unfortunately, zones with the highest potential of being walkable are the ones that face more barriers to walk. Then, adequate planning policies when implemented in the right locations could promote higher use of walking and have the potential to reduce current ==== in pedestrian infrastructure provision.","Active transport promotion has gained relevance during the last decade in both transport research and practice, partly as a consequence of rising congestion levels, pollution and traffic fatalities caused by intensive use at the global scale of motorised transport modes (Maibach, Steg, & Anable, 2009). Such an interest in active travel has been witnessed across cities in the Global North and South, with examples of progressive shifts towards walking and cycling from Rwanda to the Netherlands. The shift to active transport modes implies positive effects for both walkers and society, contributing to reduce negative environmental and health externalities while generating individual and societal benefits (Reyer, Fina, Siedentop, & Schlicht, 2014; Sallis, Frank, Saelens, & Kraft, 2004).====Despite its benefits and social relevance, walking has not been a priority in urban planning agendas of most cities, particularly in the Global South. In Latin America, historically high investments in urban highways to promote private motorised transport and in public transport, which have been often promoted as “the” primary solution for the mobility of the urban poor, contrast with lack of public investment in pedestrian spaces and bicycle infrastructure. Furthermore, car-oriented and segregating urban planning and regulations have increased urban sprawl and socio-spatial inequalities, resulting in a marginalisation of lower-income residents pushed towards the urban peripheries (Arellana, Oviedo, Guzman, & Alvarez, 2020; Oviedo & Dávila, 2016) and has locked development in motorised-dependent trajectories at the cost of more active transport modes, mainly walking and cycling (Herrmann-Lunecke, Mora, & Sagaris, 2020).====Implementing policies to develop walkable neighbourhoods to encourage walking trips (Frank et al., 2010; Frank & Bernanke, 2007) is associated with positive impacts for urban societies and contribute to improving quality of life. Furthermore, research has suggested that a good walking environment with well-designed infrastructure can reduce transport disadvantage for groups such as elderly and disabled populations (Mackett, Achuthan, & Titheridge, 2008). Developing walkable neighbourhoods involves providing adequate built environment (BE) characteristics that promote walking instead of using motorised transport modes to complete individual trips (Christiansen, Madsen, Schipperijn, Ersbøll, & Troelsen, 2014; Larranaga, Cybis, Arellana, Rizzi, & Strambi, 2016).====The concept of accessibility in its different scales is at the core of walkability. Accessibility is intrinsically related to the role of the land-use and transport systems in society, which will give individuals or groups of individuals the opportunity to participate in activities in different locations (Geurs & van Wee, 2004). In this regard, to provide the appropriate conditions of the BE to encourage walkability can be placed at the centre of policy and decision-making in urban planning. An adequate land use mix is vital to enhance the use of active transport (Guzman et al., 2020; Saelens, Sallis, & Frank, 2003). Considering that the location of activities plays an essential role in people's mobility and their accessibility to specific opportunities (Choi, Choo, & Kim, 2019), land-use distribution can directly influence the desire and ability of individuals and social groups to reach locations and perform activities that ultimately shape travel demand patterns (Ortúzar & Willumsen, 2011). We part from the notion that walking plays an essential role in enabling access to the city, reducing spatial and social inequalities and either bridging or widening gaps across social groups and geographies.====Walkability conditions in some areas of Latin American cities, especially in low-income neighbourhoods, are not particularly friendly for pedestrians, promoting inequities across inhabitants and discouraging walking trips (Larrañaga, Rizzi, Arellana, Strambi, & Cybis, 2014). Despite a disproportionate high dependency on walking for their daily mobility, low-income pedestrians face conditions that range from total lack of infrastructure and high exposure to traffic-related and environmental risks to barriers on pavements that affect comfort, safety, and attractiveness conditions of walkability (Larranaga, Arellana, Rizzi, Strambi, & Cybis, 2019; Oviedo & Titheridge, 2016). In many of the poorest neighbourhoods across the Global South, pedestrian spaces do not exist, are unpaved, undersized, without green areas, poor lighting, or occupied by parked cars (Herrmann-Lunecke & Mora, 2018). Evidence supporting inequalities in the provision of adequate conditions for the use of active transport in Latin American cities remain scarce. This paper aims to address this gap by, first, proposing a framework linking pedestrian accessibility with walkability measures. Second, we interrogate such measures to compare walking conditions on different zones using Barranquilla and Soledad, Colombia as case study. Third, we critically examine equity gaps for walking throughout the city, drawing insights for policy and practice in similar contexts.====With this notion in mind, the remainder of this paper is as follows. The second section discusses some relevant literature. The third section presents the conceptual framework to compare walking conditions of different zones, and to evaluate equity. This section also describes the study area. The fourth section contains the data analyses and some discussion about inequities regarding transport and infrastructure provision throughout the city. Finally, the fifth section concludes and recommends further research steps.","Walk this way: Pedestrian accessibility and equity in Barranquilla and Soledad, Colombia",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920302225,19 January 2021,2021,Research Article,135.0

This paper aims at proposing and evaluating a simple and transferable strategy to achieve a modal shift towards active modes in urban centers, thus reducing externalities produced by the transport sector. The proposed model, based on an efficient combination of policies to sustain transition to active modes, is discussed and evaluated through a cost-benefit analysis for three different scenarios of modal split variation. In this regard, the Scottish city of Aberdeen is used as a case study.","Transport is one of the main sectors on which the economy of modern cities is based: it is fundamental to economic growth and employment, as well being essential in determining citizens' quality of life. However, it is well-known that the transport sector does not only provide benefits to society: it is also responsible for a variety of negative effects, which are generally expressed in a series of social costs, or negative externalities. The most frequently discussed negative externalities in literature are congestion, crashes, noise and air pollution and, on a larger scale, climate change (European Parliament, 2009). These effects cause, most of the time unintentionally from the consumer's perspective, costs and damages to the urban, natural and social environment, impacting both human health and quality of life. For this reason, without the intervention of policies aimed at internalizing externalities, society faces welfare losses and imbalanced social costs (Danielis, 2011). Territorial and transport planning play a key role in implementing the right policies to minimize the loss of social well-being, thus ensuring a high level of both transport systems and quality of life. The evaluation of the externalities of transport represents an important step within the decision-making process of transport policies, as well as for transport investments. The identification of externalities on the local scale is required to develop different solutions that reflect an innovative perspective for their management and a long-term effective transport scheme.====Growing transport volumes and increasing environmental awareness have brought externalities of transport high on the political agenda of modern cities, which – being dense and attracting several functions and users – face higher challenges than rural areas. Developing corrective measures to reduce the negative impacts generated by the transport sector and improving the internalization of external costs has been a priority for European policy since 2008, when the European Commission published the first Handbook on External costs of Transport, as part of the IMPACT study (Maibach et al., 2008).====When people have to make a transport choice, they are strongly bound by the options available to them and operate within a kind of architecture which makes different options more or less attractive. Changing that architecture to promote more sustainable travel modes can bring substantial improvements in the quality of life and urban environment. Reallocation of a proportion of roads to sustainable mobility modes is becoming a political priority in Europe. Measures like priority schemes, new cycle lanes, wider and well-designed sidewalks, and more green areas, can help to achieve more efficient use of road space. Moreover, they can improve the attractiveness of active travel and urban environment, increase accessibility to specific locations, safety and its perception (Yang et al., 2019). Under certain conditions, the reduction of road capacity is a way to provide space for new bike lanes or wider sidewalks, and to encourage the modal shift, reducing, in the long term, congestion issues. In other words, it could be an effective strategy to lower the externalities of the transport sector in a local context while enhancing its safety. In this regard, parking reduction policies can have a significant impact on traffic management: they can encourage changes in travel patterns and make people more likely to cycle and walk, with positive effects on overall air quality and health (Barret et al., 2020). Additionally, parking reduction policies can improve the city center from an aesthetic point of view (Christiansen et al., 2017). Managing the availability of parking is one of few measures, among those presented as effective within the Ecotale project, involving controlling or limiting the cars' use, and managing travel demand. However, parking policies - just like any other coercive measure – are exposed to generating counter-productive results. Their implementation should be preceded by attentive research on expectable results within the specific identified context. Moreover, they must be integrated with other measures, such as improvements in public transport, active mobility options, and corrective measures to provide motorists with additional parking and driving alternatives, as to avoid bottlenecks that could compromise the overall mobility system's performance.====Taking into account the discussed premises, international and local sustainability objectives, and literature on the topics of sustainable and active mobility, this paper proposes a set of effective actions and operative measures to reduce externalities of the transport sector, minimize environmental and social impacts and spread benefits at different levels. The developed strategy is applied to the case study of Aberdeen City, Scotland. The particular characteristics and the spatial conformation of the city are accounted for to develop a proactive approach that could form the basis of a more sustainable mobility system. The main scope of this paper is to provide a non-complex, transferable sustainable mobility strategy evaluation method, that could be adopted by other authors and local institutions to understand and assess the effects of transport externalities mitigation strategies within their territory of interest or competence. A single, relevant case study selection is supported by the discussion of successful experiences throughout Europe (section 3), as to reduce approximation and enrich the discussion on the potential of active mobility strategies given the climatic, geomorphologic and social characteristics of the areas.",Pathways to active mobility planning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920302250,16 January 2021,2021,Research Article,136.0

Based on a bi-direction bottleneck network with a spatial pattern of parking, the daily commuting patterns with parking location choices are analyzed. Without road toll and parking fee, there exist two equilibrium flow patterns and one parking mode. Increasing the parking density would postpone the earliest departure time and shorten the length of departure time period. A linear location-dependent parking fee regime without road toll is then proposed. We find that three parking modes occur across the parking fee rate and the morning efficiency loss always exists no matter how the fee rate is changed. Furthermore, a combined regime of linear location-dependent parking fee and time-varying road toll is developed to minimize the total daily social cost (TDSC). Two parking modes occur as the parking fee rate increases and there exist four equilibrium flow patterns. We show that the linear location-dependent parking fees could either advance or postpone the earliest morning departure time. An inappropriate parking fee rate may increase both individual and social costs. The best system performance can be achieved with joint consideration of both the TDSC and parking supply cost.","In downtowns of most large cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, London, and Hong Kong, the fast-growing traffic demand and inadequate and costly land supply have posed a great challenge for local authorities in parking planning and management. It has been observed that 30% of road traffic was searching for a parking space and the average time to find a parking space is about 8 min (Shoup, 2006). Searching-for-parking causes not only a waste of time, but also result in some social problems, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and traffic accidents. Besides, parking fees often exceed vehicle operating costs and account for a large portion of the total trip costs. As a result, parking is an important factor affecting urban commute. Over the past few decades, various aspects of parking have been studied by researchers, such as parking demand and supply (Bifulco, 1993; Hensher & King, 2001; Van Ommeren et al., 2014), cruising for parking (Levy et al., 2013; Liu & Geroliminis, 2016), parking behavior (Li et al., 2012; Liu, 2018; Tian et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019), parking pricing (Arnott et al., 1991; Arnott & Inci, 2006; Chatman & Manville, 2014; Dale et al., 2014; Fosgerau & De Palma, 2013; Lu et al., 2015; Mei et al., 2019; Verhoef et al., 1995), parking permits (Liu, Yang, Yin, et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2011), and parking reservation (Liu, Yang, & Yin, 2014; Tian et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2013). A comprehensive survey of parking was provided by Inci (2015) from an economic perspective.====Parking pricing, as one of the most frequently and widely used instruments for managing traffic demand in urban area, has been substantially studied in the literature. Although there are a number of empirical and simulation studies on parking pricing (e.g., Axhausen & Polak, 1991; Balac et al., 2017; Chatman & Manville, 2014; Dale et al., 2014; Millard-Ball et al., 2014; Waraich et al., 2013), theoretical models for parking pricing are limited. Arnott and Rowse (1999) developed a structural model of parking in a ring-road network and investigated optimal parking pricing strategies. Anderson and de Palma (2004) found that competitive pricing could lead to an optimal parking resource distribution. In order to balance the modal split between private cars and public transit, D'Acierno et al. (2006) discussed an optimal pricing strategy for a set of parking zones.====Making use of the well-known bottleneck model (Vickrey, 1969), Arnott et al. (1991) put forward a seminal work for addressing a parking problem associated with traffic congestion. In their model, parking spaces are assumed to be continuously distributed along a highway near the city center and the parking density is a constant. They showed that the minimum total social cost can be achieved by a combination of time-varying road toll and location-dependent parking fee. More recently, considering parking capacity allocation and cruising time, Qian et al. (2011, 2012) examined various parking fee schemes to achieve the system optimum with the setup of two major parking zones. These models only focus on the morning trip-timing decisions.====The fact that commuters schedule their departure time from work does exist in reality. In some industries, such as schools and information technology (IT) enterprises (at least in China), staff members have relatively flexible work hours. That is, they can moderately adjust their off-work time according to their own needs. Based on previous travel experiences, if they predict that a queue will be encountered on the way home in a certain period of time, they will advance or postpone their own departure times to avoid queuing. For IT staff, sometimes a high overtime payment is provided, and hence they are more willing to stay in the office for a longer time, which can avoid queuing meanwhile increase their income. In addition, some other scholars, e.g., Daganzo (2013), Gonzales and Daganzo (2013), and Li et al. (2014), also realize that it is significant and essential to study the issue of departure time choice of commuters in the evening. In reality, commutes in the morning and evening peak hours are asymmetric and the evening trip-timing pattern is not a mirror image of the morning one (De Palma & Lindsey, 2002).====Zhang et al. (2008) is the first to propose an integrated bottleneck model to investigate several pricing regimes. They showed that only parking pricing or only road pricing cannot achieve the system optimum, the two pricings have to be implemented jointly to achieve the system optimum. Their study focused on the comparison analysis of system efficiencies under different regimes, where the optimal location-dependent parking fees were directly derived from a cost function. Several important issues are left and are not clear.====Congestion tolls can eliminate queuing by adjusting commuters' departure times without increasing individual travel costs (Kaddoura & Nagel, 2019; Li & Huang, 2019); while parking charges can be implemented to not only eliminate queuing but also reduce aggregated schedule delay via changing both departure time and parking order. However, the system optimum is achieved by parking pricing at the expense of considerable increase in personal costs. Since high parking charges are difficult to be accepted by the public, parking pricing level is not necessarily optimal in reality. In general, parking fee decreases with the distance from the city center. Then, we wonder how commuters’ departure time choice, parking order, and system efficiency are affected by the varying rate of parking fees. Another important factor affecting commuting pattern is the parking density. If the parking density is small, i.e., parking spaces are distributed sparsely, some people will depart earlier to compete for desired parking spaces, which may be useful for stabilizing peak hours. But land is expensive, especially in a CBD. We always hope to make full use of land resources. How to optimize the parking density is a core issue concerned by the authorities. In order to provide a theoretical support for parking planning and management, the impacts of park fees and parking density on both the daily commuting profile and the social system should be carefully investigated.====To investigate the impact of parking fees, we put forward a linear location-dependent parking fee regime, in which the parking fee rate represents the varying rate of parking fees. The higher the parking fee rate, the higher the parking fees. In this study, a highway with bi-direction roads is supposed to connect a residential district and a central business district (CBD). Each road has a bottleneck with limited capacity. A certain number of residents go to work in the morning and come back after work in the evening. They are assumed to be homogeneous. Several pricing schemes are proposed to reduce the total daily social cost (TDSC). A two-stage method is used to model the combined morning and evening commutes. In the evening commute, a Nash equilibrium is established in the sense that no one can reduce his/her evening trip cost by unilaterally altering his/her departure time; in the morning commute, a user equilibrium is built where no one can reduce his/her daily travel cost by unilaterally changing his/her departure time or parking location, and the daily travel costs of all commuters are equal.====Both Arnott et al. (1991) and our paper use road tolls and location-dependent parking fees for traffic management, however, the two works are essentially different in three aspects. First, Arnott et al. (1991) studied the morning commute problem; however, our paper studies the daily commute problem, in which the morning commute is integrated with the evening commute via parking location. Second, their traffic management strategies were designed to support both the efficient departure pattern and parking order for the morning commute; while our collaborative traffic management strategies are proposed for both the morning and evening commutes. In fact, for the daily commute, evening congestion tolls affect the strategy design for the morning commute. Third, they found that the system optimum is achieved by a combination of time-varying road toll and location-dependent parking fee. If parking fees could be made time-dependent as well as location-dependent, then the optimal parking fee at a location closer to CBD is cheaper. Obviously, this is unreasonable. In this paper, we propose a reasonable and simple form of parking fee, i.e., linear location-dependent parking fee, where a parking fee rate is defined to reflect how fast the fee changes. The impact of the parking fee rate on the parking location choice of commuters is discussed, in addition to the traditional departure time choice. Moreover, the system performance of linear parking fees with or without road tolls are investigated.====There are three major contributions in the paper. First, a reasonable and simple form of location-dependent parking fee, i.e., linear location-dependent parking fee, is proposed and investigated. We find that the proposed linearly differentiated parking fee regime can achieve zero-queuing delay and reverse parking, but it cannot obtain the minimum schedule delay cost for the morning commute. We also find that this parking fee regime could make the earliest morning departure time either advance or postpone, and there are three kinds of parking modes occurring successively as the parking fee rate increases. Second, a joint regime of linear location-dependent parking fee and evening time-varying road toll is presented. We find that the joint regime can achieve the daily system optimum, where reverse parking, the zero-queuing delays in both the morning and evening commutes, and the minimum morning schedule delay cost can be realized simultaneously. Besides, one of the three parking modes will disappear under this regime. Third, considering both the parking supply cost and the total daily social cost, the parking density is optimized.====The new findings indicate that the road pricing in the morning commute can be replaced by a linear parking fee. The latter is superior to the former in that a linear parking fee can also affect parking order and further reduce the morning schedule delay. However, the road pricing in the evening commute is indispensable, since only this strategy can eliminate queuing delay in the work-to-home trip and meanwhile it can improve the system performance of parking fees.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem. Section 3 first establishes the evening commute given the parking location choices of commuters in the morning, then considers the evening trip cost as part of the daily travel cost for deriving the morning commuting patterns. Section 4 proposes and investigates a linear location-dependent parking fee regime. Section 5 develops a joint regime of linear location-dependent parking fee and evening road toll to achieve the daily system optimum. Under each regime, all possible commuting patterns and parking modes are identified analytically. Furthermore, Section 6 designs the optimal parking density. Section 7 provides a set of numerical examples. Finally, Section 8 concludes this paper.",Equilibrium analysis of parking for integrated daily commuting,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920302171,6 January 2021,2021,Research Article,137.0

Activities intended to reduce the share of private cars in fulfilling the mobility needs of inhabitants are undertaken in urban areas with growing intensity.====The paper presents the results of a survey carried out among individuals commuting by private car in the central part of Silesia Province in Poland. The purpose of the conducted research was to better understand the attitudes of the respondents to private cars and public transport, as well as to increase knowledge of what level of costs of car use would force cars users to shift to public transport.====The main research results indicate that the economic factors, such as fuel prices or public transport fares, are not very effective in changing transport behaviours. The obtained research results confirm that psychological factors are decisive for such an unwillingness to switch to public transport. An increase of public transport modal share in daily commuting requires taking simultaneous and complex actions, not only for the improvement of the quality of public transport but also in order to increase the burden of using private cars.","The dynamic development of road transport, including especially private car traffic that we have been experiencing globally for over 30 years is one of the major sources of natural environment pollution, noise, as well as one of the main reasons behind the consumption of non-renewable resources. There are growing difficulties related to traffic congestion, pollution and deteriorating quality of life of inhabitants in the urban areas. The review of previous research in the field of potential of modal shift from private cars to public transport shows that it is a constantly current and important research problem, both from the perspective of theory and application (Kingham et al., 2001; Beirao & Sarsfield-Cabral, 2007; Redman et al., 2013; Şimşekoğlu et al., 2015; Boussauw & Vanoutrive, 2017). It is necessary to undertake actions in the cities around the world that will result in reducing private car traffic in favour of alternative, more resource-saving and environmentally friendly transport modes, especially actions in favour of increasing public transport share in fulfilling the mobility needs of inhabitants of the cities.====The motorization index, i.e. the number of private cars per 1000 inhabitants reached a value of 586 in Poland in 2017. It is one of the highest indices in the European Union (the motorization index for EU reached 505 private cars/1000 inhabitants in 2017) (Eurostat; GUS Database). Moreover, the motorization index in Poland increased in 2017 by approximately 125% in comparison with 2000 and it is definitely the most dynamic increase in this period in the whole EU. The number of private cars registered in Poland was increasing much more dynamically than it had been predicted in the most optimistic economic forecasts prepared for the formulation of assumptions for the transport policy of the country. The analysis of household expenditure also demonstrates that Poland differs from other European countries, not only from 15 most developed countries which were part of the so-called old EU, but also from the Central and Eastern European countries, the so-called new 13, which joined the EU after 2004. The expenditure on purchase and operation of individual transport modes in Poland is significantly higher than in other countries, whereas the expenditure on transport services, including public transport, is significantly lower (Urbanek, 2018).====Therefore, the results of research on the attitudes and commuters’ willingness to switch conducted in a country such as Poland may significantly contribute to the existing theoretical output (see Table 1). The main research questions addressed in this study are:====In order to explore the research questions, the stated preference survey was conducted among the individuals commuting by private car in the central part of Silesia Province in Poland. Stated preference methods are widely accepted and used in travel behaviour research and practice particularly in the process of identification of behavioural responses to choice situations that are not disclosed in the market (Hensher, 1994). SP-surveys offer the opportunity to collect data regarding hypothetical choices, potentially unavailable alternatives (Efthymiou et al., 2013). Stated preference approach has been widely used to investigate the mobility behaviour and determinants of mode choice (Abraham, 1999; Fukuda et al., 2005). SP methods regarding the costs of private cars usage and potential of modal shift were also used in previous studies, for example by Kingham et al. (2001), Fiorio and Percoco (2007) or De Witte et al. (2006).====The central part of Silesia Province in Poland is a highly urbanised region, the second largest metropolitan area in Poland. The dynamic increase of the share of private car in modal split, with a simultaneous decrease of public transport share, has been observed in the central part of Silesia Province for over a decade. In Silesia Province, approximately 68% of daily commuting is done by private car (GUS, 2015). The motorization indices in many cities of the central part of the region are higher than the average for Poland and the entire Silesia Province. For example, the motorization index in Katowice (capital of the region) in 2017 amounted to 704 private cars/1000 inhabitants (GUS Database).====The conducted research complements the previous theoretical output concerning the potential of modal shift from private cars to public transport with the results of research on the willingness of car users to bear higher expenditure on fuel. Although previous research has thus revealed a lot about factors that prevent a modal shift from cars towards public transport (Anable, 2005; Steg, 2005, 2007; Redman et al., 2013), and a number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the willingness to pay for travel time savings (Hensher, 2001a, 2001b; Daly et al., 2014; De Borger & Fosgerau, 2008), for improving public transport services (Eboli & Mazzulla, 2008; Molin & Timmermanns, 2006; Khattak et al., 2003), only a few studies conducted so far have referred to the willingness to bear higher expenditure related to car use and therefore, to the overall value attributed to the car as a commute mode (Kingham et al., 2001; Fiorio & Percoco, 2007). Therefore, there is a need to complement previous research to increase knowledge of what level of costs of car use would force cars users to shift to public transport. Such knowledge is important not only from the theoretical point of view but also from the perspective of transport policy in cities and structural interventions to develop more sustainable urban transport. Moreover, this paper offers a new point of view by introducing the results of research on the attitudes in a country such as Poland, i.e. a dynamically developing young market economy, characterised by pro-car mobility culture.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a comprehensive state of the art review of travel mode choice factors and factors that play the most important role from the perspective of attracting car users to public transport. Section 3 presents the applied method, as well as the procedures of respondent selection and research conduct; it also describes the sample design and research tool.

A series of discrete choice experiments is conducted with 789 participants. Framing conditions like information on CO==== through fiscal incentives) has the expected effect of reducing the choice of travelling and hence CO==== emissions. Providing information on CO,"According to the IEA (2018) transport accounted for one quarter of total world CO==== emissions from fuel combustion in 2016 and these are still continuously increasing. After repeated alerts by climate scientists urging sharp reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the sense of urgency seems to be felt on the policy side in the Paris Agreement (2015)and more generally in public opinion. Regarding transport it is recognized that improvements undertaken in vehicle energy efficiency will not be sufficient in the coming decades and that behavioral changes are also needed, such as shifting from individual to public (or shared) transportation vehicles or to lower-emission modes per passenger-km or even reducing kilometers travelled.====When it comes to behavioral changes to reduce transport externalities, carbon taxes (CT) and vehicle taxes are advocated by the majority of economists as the most efficient instruments (Parry et al., 2007, p. 37). According to the OECD (2018), which analyzed carbon pricing in 42 OECD and G20 countries, the average “pricing gap” (difference between the current benchmark value of 30 euros per ton of CO==== and the effective carbon rate including carbon tax and specific fuel tax) amounts to 21% for road transport and 58% for off-road transport. Moreover, this gap is narrowing at too slow a pace with respect to future benchmark values in 2030. A specific CT on fuel was introduced in France without public fanfare in 2014 in a period when fuel prices were rather low. In autumn 2018 its planned increase during a period of increasing fuel prices faced fierce popular opposition and was cancelled by the government. Indeed, public opinion can be very sensitive if not resistant to fuel tax increases.====Given the public sensitivity to economic incentives intended to reduce fuel consumption it is relevant to consider variants like carbon trading. Their roots in the economic literature can be found initially as a combination of economic incentive and quantity control, namely marketable or tradable permits (Baumol & Oates, 1988). “Domestic tradable quotas” covering transport and household energy were initially proposed by David Fleming in 1996. Raux and Marlot (2005) and Raux (2011) discuss pros and cons of downstream carbon trading schemes in transportation (also known as personal carbon trading, PCT). A variant of PCT includes also housing energy and was recently empirically explored by Wadud and Chintakayala (2019).====When compared with a CT potential supplementary outcomes are expected from PCT on psychological grounds rather than only economic ones (Fawcett, 2010). Another hybrid instrument named “bonus-malus” (similar in principle to feebates, see Greene et al., 2005) has been shown also to have such combined effects in some applications (see literature review below).====Other than the stated preference studies on PCT effectiveness referred to in the next section we do not know of any research which systematically examines the psychological effects of various framings of carbon schemes on behavior, and which isolates these aspects from their pure economic effects. In this paper, by “framing” we mean the ways of presenting a choice based initially on objective economic properties (here the trade-off between travel price and travel duration) that change the informational context (information on CO==== emissions), psychological aspects (social norms) or economic aspects (fiscal incentives).====The aim of this paper is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of economic and psychological interventions in motivating environmentally responsible mobility behavior. We do so by the means of discrete choice experiments where we control for travel price and travel duration, while introducing in a controlled setting various framing conditions such as information on CO==== emissions, an injunctive social norm and a descriptive one, and fiscal framings such as a CT, a bonus-malus and a PCT scheme.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

The empirical findings of the study show the existence of a cointegration between the variables. Additionally, according to the results of the analysis, there was no significant relationship between economic growth and rail container transport. On the other hand, maritime container transport has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth both in the short- and long-run. These findings could be used to develop an extensive and efficient container transport system which contributes more to ====, thus to economic growth of Turkey.","The process of increased globalization has been accompanied with rising trend of the scope of intraregional and interregional trade and has led to closer and more effective cooperation and interdependency between countries and resulted in ever increasing volumes and varieties of cross-border transactions in goods and services. Transport is one of the most important ingredients for the economic and social development of all countries. An extensive and efficient transport system may substantially contribute to increase agricultural and industrial production as it enables and allows products to reach domestic and international markets at competitive prices. It has the potential to boost foreign trade (Wang et al., 2018) and enhance tourism revenues and eventually national income. It also significantly contributes the regional and global cooperation and economies. (United Nations, 2015).====To examine the relationships between transport and economic growth has always been a major focus of transport economists. (Brunel, 2005), since as explained in (Banerjee et al., 2020), transportation sector is always considered as one of the key factors to have stable growth and establish the developed society. That's why, today, the developed countries have better designed and developed transportation sectors than that of underdeveloped countries. The transportation sector not only plays essential role in the growth of the countries, but also it significantly affects our daily life. (Raza et al., 2019). With the help of having a better transportation sector, a country can easily facilitate the mobility of freight and people, which may result in stimulation of trade and making specialization and economies of scale possible, especially for the transport-using sector of the economy. It has also potential to affect the labour supply by creating more and easier access to better and higher-paying jobs. As is explained in (Zou et al., 2019), besides increasing the productivity of other production factors, it can create ‘agglomeration’ effect. As is concluded in Fernald (1999), Straub (2008), and Rodrigue et al. (2009), we should expect significant contributions of a compressive and efficient transportation network to economic growth. Besides contributing the economic growth, well developed and extensive transportation, promotes territorial accessibility and allows people to access to markets, schools, health and social services, thus contributing to improve the welfare of society and to decrease the societal inequality. Finally, having an extensive efficient transportation sector, a country can create a better business investment climate, increase the national competitiveness, and boost economic development (Li & DaCosta, 2013).====As is well known, with the liberalization of international trade as a main development strategy particularly starting in early 1980s, there have been tremendous developments taking place in the transportation sector. The liberalization of international trade has changed the shipping routes. It initiated to develop the new ports, and lead to connectivity for international commodity trade. Most importantly, it created an impact on maritime (Li & DaCosta, 2013). As a result of these developments, the maritime transportation has become the major channel of international trade and is now a crucial component of the world's economy, as the largest carrier of freight around the globe (Mansouri et al., 2015). Maritime transport remains the backbone of globalized trade and the manufacturing supply chain, as more than four fifths of world merchandise trade by volume is carried by sea. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2019), over 90% of the world's trade is delivered by maritime transport. Also, according to UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics 2019, since 1980, the total international seaborne trade has increased more than 70% in terms of weight and according to maritime sector report of 2017, the share of seaborne trade is 85% (mt).====There are many factors significantly contributing the growth in maritime transportation, such as rising population, increasing standard of living, rapid industrialization, exhaustion of local resources, road congestion, and elimination of trade barriers. Also, the globalization of business process and the increase of global-scale trade has increased maritime transport growth (Jebli & Belloumi, 2017). On the other hand, the extensive and efficient maritime transport is also plays a key in the development of foreign economic relations of landlocked countries and also contributes to their economic growth. (Akbulaev & Bayramli, 2020).====Turkey initiated liberal policies with an orthodox stabilization policy in early 1980s. aiming to minimize the state involvement in the Turkey's economy. One of the main pillars of these new policies was transforming its economic development policy from a strategy of “import substituting industrialization” to “export led growth” (Özer, 2017, pp. 157–176). Following this radical shift in development policy sphere, various export promoting incentives were initiated (including tax exemptions, rebates and favourable credit terms), direct import controls were eliminated, and quantity restrictions were lifted. As a result, Turkey's share in world trade increased from 0.15% in 1980 to 0.97 percent in 2017. Exports of Turkey risen to 157 billion dollars in 2017 from 2.9 billion dollars in 1980. Also Turkey's trade volume has increased from 10.8 billion dollars in 1980 to 390.7 billion dollars in 2017 (TURKSTAT, 2018).====Turkey is located along the main artery of traffic between Asia and Europe. Turkey has borders with many countries including Bulgaria, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Surrounded by the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south, the country connects the Balkans to the Middle East; Central Asia to the Caucasus; and the Black Sea countries with the Mediterranean countries. The country has a total area of 814.578 km====, 8333 km of which is coast line.====According to OECD report (2009), Turkey's this strategic position provides Turkey a potential to play a pivotal role in regional and global integration. Moreover, the important energy, trade and transport networks which connect west to east and north to south plays key role for unleashing this potential. Finally, the economic and political developments throughout neighbouring regions taking place since late 2000s, particularly in the Balkans, the Black Sea region, the Mediterranean Basin, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East furtherly has been contributing to strength the Turkey's regional and global role.====To play this key regional and global role results from its unique geographical position and for Turkey's economic and social development, Turkey first priority should be improving its transport system. It is fair to say that in recent years, Turkey has spent relatively high amount of resources to make a strategic investment in transportation infrastructure. Also there are a lot of efforts and legal arrangements to improve and diversify its domestic and international transportation. All these investment and efforts started to pay off in terms of rising production and positive developments in Turkey's foreign trade and tourism.====Road transport is the primary mode of domestic freight transport in Turkey (over 90%) followed by maritime freight transport with 5.6% and share of rail transport in domestic freight transport is approximately 4.4%. Even though road transport is the primary mode of domestic freight transport in Turkey, the maritime transportation is the most preferred method of transportation both in Turkey's exports and imports. According to (2017 sector enf), 88.47% of the Turkey's foreign trade has been being realized by maritime transportation. 61.60% of the volume of Turkey's foreign trade transportation has been carried by sea, 22.60% has been carried by road, 0.50% has been carried by rail, 13.90% has been carried by air and 1.40% has been carried by other transportation modes. Maritime transport is the most usual method of transportation for Turkey's exports and imports, with respective shares of 58.16% and 64.13%, followed by road transportation, with a share of 29.18% for exports and 17.74% for imports. Airport transport comes as third with shares of 10.82% for exports and 16.09% for imports and finally rail transport's shares are 0.44% and 0.55% for exports and imports respectively (TURKSTAT, 2018).====Maritime transport is one of the most liberalized sectors in Turkey, with a strong private shipping sector. All of the major ports are accessible by railways. These are Haydarpaşa, Derince, İzmir, Bandırma, Mersin, Samsun, İskenderun, Tekirdağ, Zonguldak, Yılport ve Evyap ports (Republic of Turkey Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2018). With over 8000 km of coastline, Turkey's major ports have been registered as international ports, ferry links and container terminals by the European Agreement on Main International Combined Transportation Lines and Related Facilities (AGTC). Container traffic at ports has been increasing annually by approximately 20%. The ports, channels, and inland waters of Turkey can be recognized as critical nodes in world container transportation network due to its strategic and geographical position. The globalization and liberalization processes in the region and new enterprises on several sector increase the demand and expectations especially from port and terminal authorities (Çelik & Er, 2007; Çelik et al., 2009).====In Turkey, the railway system is run by State railway company, Turkish State Railways (TCDD), a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) with monopoly rights. The State owns all railway assets, manages the infrastructure and directly operates rail services not mainly pursuing profitability. There is no separation of accounts between infrastructure management and train operations. Fares and investments are generally regulated by the State and some operating losses are compensated by the State, as well. Despite its geographical features and years of experience, the railway network lacks sufficient capacity and many parts of the infrastructure have not seen new investment. Since the existing railway network is concentrated on a few major routes, the railway services are available only in certain areas and between certain cities.====The length of the rail network in Turkey in 2018 is 12740 km, which is mostly single-tracked and is characterised by mountainous terrain, tight curves and steep gradients. Total amount of freight carried by railway in 2018 is 31673 thousand tons. Out of this 31673 thousand tons, 29353 thousand tons are domestic freight and remaining 2070 thousand tons are subjected to foreign trade. In national transport, railways do not carry intermodal transport units, such as containers, swap bodies or semi-trailers. Partly because of the strong position of long-haul domestic road transport in Turkey, there does not seem to be a market for such intermodal services, even though distances between main economic centres within Turkey are often more than 500–600 km. At these distances, intermodal transport operations are considered to be viable in Western European countries.====With this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to examine the dynamic short and long-run impacts of different container transport modes, maritime and rail, on economic growth in Turkey by using the bounds testing procedure to cointegration, referred to as the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach (Pesaran et al., 2001). Also, related to this aim, the study also aims to provide long-run evidences to be used to form extensive and efficient intermodal systems especially aiming to increase the Turkey's international container transport capacity and foreign exchange earnings. Finally, by estimating effects of two container transport modes on economic growth, for the inland freight transport, we try to provide empirical evidences which can be used to develop a strategy allowing more involvement of railway container transportation to carry more goods to the port before export. Thus, both by estimating the short-and long-run growth effects of two modes of container transports in Turkey and providing empirical evidences to develop an extensive and efficient intermodal system, which includes choice of mode and the containerization decision in moving containerized export cargo in the inland segment, we try to contribute growing literature in container transport and its relation to economic growth. Also, this paper contributes to decision-makers to better understand the relations between container transport and economic growth and to make rational choices about the country's transportation policies by providing a long-run estimates of elasticities of growth with respect to maritime and railway container transport.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the related literature. We introduce and explain model, methods and data used in the study in section 3. The empirical results are outlined and discussed in Section 4.

According to this discipline, systems of economic and spatial interaction are considered as spatial networks and are modeled into graphs. This approach allows studying transportation networks and other spatial networks of national and global economic importance in terms of graph theory and statistical mechanics and it can provide new insights for the structure and functionality of these systems, which are not visible through the prism of spatial and economic analysis. Within this context, this paper models the interregional road transportation network in Greece (GRN), a spatial network of prime economic importance for its country, into a geo-referenced primal graph and it discusses its geographical and topological features under the regional economics' perspective. The results show that ==== has a mesh (lattice-like) structure subjected to spatial constraints and that it is ruled by primary developmental dynamics, where many aspects of network topology are related to economic aspects of the road network. Overall, the paper highlights that measures of network topology are related to different aspects of the network's socio-economic framework and thus they can be considered as indicators of economic performance for this transportation network.","Road networks are of major importance for the conduct of worldwide transportation, in terms of network length, traffic, and the number of users (Barthelemy, 2011). Provided that transportation is (by default) subjected to spatial constraints (O'Sullivan, 2007, p. 528; Rodrigue et al., 2013), the structure of transportation networks over time depicts the social ability to overcome at a certain time the spatial constraints, in order the societies to communicate (Tsiotas & Polyzos, 2018). In literature, the study of street-networks has been multidisciplinary and has attracted the attention from researchers across many disciplines, such as e.g. transport engineers, urban and regional planners, geographers, architects, environmental scientists, and physicists (Garrison and Marble, 1963; Porta, 2006a,b; Barthelemy, 2011; Hanna et al., 2013; Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014; Tsekeris, 2017; Marshall et al., 2018). A major strength of this polyphony is the rich empirical knowledge produced by diverse approaches (Porta, 2006a,b; Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014), whereas the inevitable lack of communication between various disciplines due to their different context of conceptualization becomes a current challenge (Marshall et al., 2018) raising the demand for integration.====Within this context of polyphony, the study of the relation between network structure and the socio-economic framework of transportation networks is a complex task subjected to inevitable disciplinary constraints (O'Sullivan, 2007, p. 528; Rodrigue et al., 2013; Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014). For instance, geographers, urban, and regional planners appear to focus more on the spatial and economic interaction of transportation networks rather than on the network topology per se, where physicists and computational scientists are usually more focused (Barthelemy, 2001; Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014). Economists are usually interested in the underlying living structures of transport networks and interpret them as markets consisting of high sunk costs (Link et al., 2012) and trade and economic interaction (O'Sullivan, 2007, p. 528; Rodrigue et al., 2013). Also, geographers and regional planners appear more interested in studying transportation networks at the regional scale (Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014), whereas transport engineers and urban planners usually deal with research at the urban scale (Porta, 2006a,b). In terms of representation, transport engineers seem to prefer modeling street-networks to axial maps, geographers to GIS-based physical and metric representations, urban planners to topological representations, and physicists to topological and metric representations (Porta, 2006a,b; Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014; Marshall et al., 2018; Serra & Hillier, 2019).====In the light of serving the certain demand for integration, it is a consensus that graph modeling is a common component in the majority of the multidisciplinary approaches studying transportation networks (Rodrigue et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2018). Graph modeling builds on the network paradigm (Brandes et al., 2013; Newman, 2010) to represent communication systems into pair-sets of nodes and links and then to facilitate the study of their structure (called network analysis) in terms of various measurable attributes computed from the connectivity (adjacency) matrix of each graph (Newman, 2010). This modeling is effective in the research of communication systems at every geographical scale and it is privileged in including both functional and structural information in a single model (O'Sullivan, 2007, p. 528; Rodrigue et al., 2013). On the other hand, modeling a transport network as a graph is not the prime objective of transportation research but it suggests a powerful tool facilitating the answer to certain research questions. Within the context of regional science and transport geography (O'Sullivan, 2007, p. 528; Rodrigue et al., 2013), the importance of transportation networks depends on the underlying living structures (Jiang, 2004) facilitating their infrastructures. In economic terms, those structures are seen as markets, the dynamics of which are reflected on the topology of transportation networks supporting their needs and, vice-versa, structural constraints immanent in transportation networks affect their further developmental dynamics.====This symbiotic relation, between transport networks and their underlying socio-economic structures, is of major importance for the regional science, which seeks for profound knowledge conceptualizing economy and space to develop effective planning and policy tools for solving the regional inequalities problem. Within this framework, an integrated approach in the study of transportation networks should build on the pillars of the economy, geography (space), and on graph modeling (which prevails in empirical research) to provide insights promoting the goals of regional science (Ducruet & Beauguitte, 2014; Tsiotas & Polyzos, 2018). Aiming at serving this demand, this paper studies the topology of the (nationwide) interregional Road Network in Greece (GRN) in terms of its geographical and socio-economic framework to provide insights about the links between society, economy, and space. Greece is a coastal country of an area of almost 132,000km==== and it includes more than 14,000 km of coastline and more than 1350 islands, islets, and rocky islands, among which over 230 are inhabited (ELSTAT, 2011). In the country, land transport is a key component for national and regional economic development because it services almost 88% of the national population located in continental and coastal regions (covering about 82% of the total land area) (ELSTAT, 2011). The Greek interregional road network (GRN) has a length of 35,860 km and it connects diverse mountainous, land, and coastal places, which favor the emergence of alternative and competitive transportation modes. According to the General Framework of Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development of Greece (GSPF, 2008), transportation development is a major strategic goal for the national and regional economic development of the country and the promotion of specialized economic and productivity aspects such as tourism, trade, and communication. Within this context, a (geo-referenced) primary graph model of the GRN is constructed incorporating geometric (geographical) and topological (functional) information, whereas socio-economic information is extracted from the regional (at the NUTS III level) administrative division of the country due to data availability and to the governance and policy conceptualization of this division. The study aims at serving the demand for integration in transportation research by detecting links between network topology, economy, and space.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows; Section 2 includes a literature review, Section 3 describes the methodological framework of the study, Section 4 shows the results of the analysis and discusses them in terms regional economics and network science, and, finally, in Section 5, conclusions are given.",Drawing indicators of economic performance from network topology: The case of the interregional road transportation in Greece,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592030202X,24 November 2020,2020,Research Article,141.0

We study the issue of bus headway variability, focusing on headway variability at bus dispatching, which is a very relevant issue that has not been properly analysed in existing studies, despite the considerable influence of irregular dispatching on bus bunching. We identify the variables that are statistically significant in explaining bus headway variability at the beginning of routes, using large GPS and smartcard databases of all bus routes in Santiago, Chile. Three measures of headway variability are used: ====, modified index per observation and an ad-hoc measure included in the Santiago bus contracts, called ‘minutes of incidence’. Significant variables to explain headway variability are bus frequency, number of bus services per terminal, distance from the bus depot to the first stop, route length, bus demand and operating speed. The measured performance of each bus operator is different depending on the headway variability indicator used, which points to the relevance of choosing an appropriate index of service reliability as a financial incentive in contracts. Implications for service planning are discussed.","In urban public transport, bus services are often affected by various phenomena that impair their operation and affect the user's travel experience. A perennial problem of urban bus routes is headway variability, which tends to bunch together consecutive vehicles of the same route. Randomness in travel times and passenger demand are common drivers of delays; even a minor bus delay is enlarged in an uncontrolled system, because a delayed bus is likely to encounter an extra number of passengers at downstream stops, which increases boarding and alighting times, and therefore delays the bus even further. As a result, the subsequent bus has a reduced number of passengers to pick up in the next stops and runs faster than scheduled. Thus, the headway between these two vehicles shortens as they progress along the route, to the point in which the two buses may bunch together, a phenomenon analytically described by Newell and Potts (1964) and empirically shown in several studies (e.g., Byon et al., 2018; Cats, 2014; Hammerle et al., 2005; Lizana et al., 2014; Strathman et al., 1999). Because the number of passengers who board to a bus that arrives after a long headway is larger, bunching causes an additional discomfort due to induced overcrowding of passengers and a reduction in the probability of obtaining a seat when travelling (Babaei et al., 2014; Cats et al., 2016; Muñoz et al., 2020). As a result of bus bunching, service reliability is reduced and passenger waiting time is increased (Osuna & Newell, 1972).====Within the general context of public transport reliability as a key factor that influences riders’ decisions (Tirachini et al., 2014), bus headway variability along a route is a problem that has been widely studied with analytical, simulation and econometric models. Among the factors that affect bus bunching, we can highlight the following: service frequency of buses, volume of passengers boarding and alighting, traffic congestion, number of bus stops, number of traffic signals and length of route (Arriagada et al., 2018; Figliozzi et al., 2012; Moreira-Matias et al., 2012; Muñoz et al., 2020). A few authors have claimed that irregularity of bus dispatching at the beginning of a route is one of the variables that contribute the most to the increase in bus bunching along a route (Arriagada et al., 2018; Hammerle et al., 2005; Moreira-Matias et al., 2012). Cham (2006) identifies bus headway variability at terminals as one of the main causes of service unreliability. According to this study, the causes of headway deviation from schedule are a combination of poor terminal supervision and operator behaviour. Some effects that can result in late dispatching from a bus terminal are an increase in passenger loads on downstream bus stops and an increase in boarding and alighting times, which in turn increases dwell times at stops and bus travel times. If there is insufficient time at the end of the trip to recover these delays, buses could return late to the terminal, affecting the next dispatches. Moreira-Matias et al. (2012) studied the sequence of bus stops where the deviation of observed headway in comparison to scheduled headway causes bus bunching in two urban bus lines in Porto. The authors found that the phenomenon of bunching starts at initial stops, and that there is a positive correlation between headway deviation in a given stop and deviation in the following stops.====In Santiago, there is an integrated bus-metro (subway) citywide public transport system called Transantiago, which started operation in 2007. Buses in the system are operated by seven private companies (called “business units”), and in total, there are approximately 6500 buses and 356 bus routes. More detailed descriptions of Transantiago are found in Munizaga and Palma (2012) and Muñoz et al. (2014). One of the unresolved issues in the daily operation of Transantiago is bus bunching in both peak and off-peak periods (Arriagada et al., 2018; Byon et al., 2018), which leads to headway unreliability and increased waiting time (Durán-Hormazábal & Tirachini, 2016), a problem that is continuously mentioned in user surveys as one of the weakest features of Transantiago. In this system, there is also evidence of the significant effect of irregular bus dispatching on performance along routes. Data gathered by García (2016) shows the evolution of an ad hoc Transantiago headway variability measure called ‘Minutes of Incidence’ (Minc), which internalizes how far an actual headway is from the scheduled headway (the formula for the calculation of the Minc metric is provided in Section 2.1). Fig. 1 depicts the evolution of the Minc variable as a function of route distance to the first bus stop, averaged for all routes that each operator company (U1 to U7) runs. Basically, all seven companies are relatively equal on how they control headway variability en route, as the slopes of the seven curves in Fig. 1 are very similar. Almost all the difference on headway variability is explained by how regular the dispatching is at the terminal (the intercept of the curves in Fig. 1). This lack of regularity at dispatching is a factor that significantly increases bus bunching en route and waiting times, as estimated by Arriagada et al. (2018). In summary, the regularity of dispatching is crucial for bus bunching along routes. However, although there are models that explain headway variability along a route in Santiago and other cities, there has not been econometric studies on determining the factors that influence the regularity or irregularity of bus dispatching. This type of models is estimated in this paper.====The case of Santiago is particularly interesting for this analysis because of the striking differences in performance by the seven bus operators, as shown in Fig. 1. This issue inevitably points to the suitability of the performance or compliance indicators that the regulator included in the Santiago bus contracts. The choice of performance indicators that are linked to financial incentives in performance-based contracts has been a problem of great complexity for contract design in theory and practice; in the literature we can find overviews of several cases including bus reforms in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, England, Singapore, China, Colombia and Peru, among others (Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2014; Hensher & Houghton, 2004; Hensher & Stanley, 2003; Leong et al., 2016; Wallis & Bray, 2014). Service reliability is a usual concern of service regulators when setting performance indicators in several cities, including Santiago. The evolution of performance indexes during the first four years of Transantiago is analysed by Beltrán et al. (2013), which shows that the first compliance indicator introduced in contracts (an index that measured the number of seat and standing places supplied by each company and compared it to the theoretical value actually offered in the operational programs) had the effect of increasing by 22% the operational bus fleet in the city. More recently, Tamblay et al. (2017) and Batarce and Ávila (2020) analyse current Transantiago contracts and find the existence of mechanisms that transfer revenue risks from operators to the regulator, a fact that weakens the power of the performance incentives in contracts to actually influence the behaviour of bus operators and increase service reliability.====None of the previous studies analyses if the relative performance of each operator, as measured by a service reliability index, is influenced or depends in any way on the actual index or indicator chosen in the contract to financially reward or penalise operators. This issue has implications for both the operators, as their revenues depend on their compliance with pre-established indicators, and for the users, as the existence of high-compliance well-defined indicators increases service reliability. In this context, the contributions of this study are two-fold. First, we determine the design and demand variables that explain the irregularity observed when dispatching buses at the beginning of each route, given the paramount influence that bus dispatching has on the service performance along routes. To this end, multivariate regression models (including robust regression models) are developed and estimated, using data from the operation of all routes of Transantiago. In particular, we use the information associated with the location of buses along routes and smartcard payment transactions made by passengers. The model estimation is specific to Santiago, however, where appropriate, we make general discussions on the implications of our results to other cities that share some characteristics of Santiago's public transport system, such as having several private operators managing and operating different bus routes, terminals and depots (e.g., Bogota, Singapore, London, Sydney). The models presented in this study are, to the best of our knowledge, the first ones to determine the variables that are statistically significant on characterizing headway variability at the beginning of bus routes in urban systems. Second, we show that the relative performance of bus operator does indeed depend on the indicator chosen to measure reliability, which emphasises the relevance of choosing the right incentives in contracts to penalise or reward operators in a way that is fair to them and increased quality of service.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains the data collection procedure carried out for the development of the statistical models. Section 3 describes the independent variables that are constructed and used in the models, as well as the measures of headway variability (dependent variable) included in this research.

In the case of goods or services with network effects, the market tends to reflect a “winner takes all” phenomenon as potential customers are attracted to products with high level network effects. Classic examples include information and communication technology (ICT) such as the telephone and the fax. The transportation sector has attracted recent attention in this area due to its convergence with ICT. With the advent of connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs),==== connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have emerged as a convergence technology that combines the advantages of CVs and AVs and compensates for the disadvantages inherent in each technology (Mahmassani, 2016; Parent, 2013; Talebpour et al., 2015). The CAV is considered a future automobile platform that will provide mobility and exchange various kinds of information with the driving environment. In general, CAVs use vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology, which includes various information exchanges between vehicle and other vehicles (V2V), pedestrians (V2P), and networks (V2N) (Parent, 2013; Talebpour et al., 2015), and process and compute information via the inherent central processing unit of the vehicle or external servers. Consequently, CAVs are expected to change the transportation sector by significantly mitigating the occurrence of accidents, traffic congestion, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy consumption (Hendrickson et al., 2014; Mahmassani, 2016; Peng, 2016; Talebpour and Mahmassani, 2016). It is predicted that CAVs will have an annual USD 1.2-trillion economic impact on 13 US industries, including insurance, transportation, land development, auto repair, oil and gas, and medicine/healthcare (Clements and Kockelman, 2017).====In bringing about the successful diffusion of CAVs in the future transportation sector, both the number of CAV users and the degree of ICT infrastructure coverage will be important factors, as well as the maturity of CAV technologies. The reason for this is that CAV is a product with a high degree of direct and indirect network effects that exchanges information with other vehicles and ICT infrastructure. CAV and ICT infrastructure are mutually complementary, and so they have an indirect network effect that increases each other's value (Farrell and Klemperer, 2007). This indirect network effect puts policymakers who develop transportation planning in a “chicken and egg problem”: the chicken and egg problem between CAV and ICT infrastructure is “Which one of CAV and ICT infrastructure should be supplied first, to bring about the successful diffusion of CAVs?” Policymakers should investigate whether there are direct and indirect network effects in the CAV market and which effect is more important to bring about a successful paradigm shift to CAVs in the transportation sector,. To address this issue, consumer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for CAV technology and ICT infrastructure should be investigated. Although qualitative and quantitative studies investigate separately consumers' preferences for AVs and CVs, there has been to the best of our knowledge little analysis of the network effects of CAVs.====The current study analyzes consumer preferences for CAVs by focusing on the connectivity (or interaction) of CAVs in terms of direct and indirect network effects, and by examining the network effects on the consumer choice of CAVs under hypothetical scenarios. For this purpose, we conducted a choice experiment that considers the network effects of CAVs, and used a mixed logit model to estimate the consumer utility function of CAVs, reflecting the heterogeneity of potential customers. Based on the results, we calculated the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for CAV attributes and related ICT infrastructure.

In this paper, we have investigated train-feeder mode choice on the basis of 185 interviews with Italian train users living in cities of different size. We analyzed their current choice and their stated choices under hypothetical scenarios using various discrete choice model specifications. Their current train-feeder mode choice is mainly car-based: 63.2% of the respondents use the car, as either drivers or passengers. The active modes cycling and walking are chosen by 18.4% and 9.7% of the respondents, respectively; the remaining using either the bus or the scooter. Our estimates confirm that ","Together with many benefits, mass motorization causes numerous problems such as air and noise pollution. Many authors emphasized these aspects (e.g. Banister, 2008; Cervero, 2013) and highlighted the importance of a shift of the transport planning paradigm towards sustainable and active mobility. The latter can be broadly defined as encompassing a wide variety of human-powered modes, including but not limited to walking and cycling (Metrolinx, 2018).====In the context of the Italian built environment, characterized by a network of small-medium cities connected by railway lines, rail transport represents an environmentally friendly alternative to the use of the car for intercity travel. However, its attractiveness depends on the efficiency on the total transport chain from the place of residence to the place of activity. The trip to and from the train station plays a crucial role in determining the railways’ competitiveness for intercity commuting (Button & Rietveld, 1999; Rietveld, 2000). In fact, accessing∖egressing a railway station is often the weakest part of the transport chain, hence contributing to travel time increases and travel discomfort. The modal choice to access/egress railway stations include both motorized and active transport modes.====In this paper, the focus is on rail transport users and their choice among the various train feeder modes, with a special attention to the active one (walking and cycling). In Italy, in 2018 passive passenger modes (auto and motorcycle) accounted for 71.3% of the travelled distance (measured in passenger-km), public transportation for 23.5%, while the active modes lagged behind with a mere 5.2% (Isfort , 2019). The picture was not particularly different when considering the time spent on mobility in a given day of the week. Private passive mobility dominated the scene with 58.2%, followed by active mobility with 22.5%, and public transportation with 19.3%. The use of active modes was particularly weak within suburban areas where merely 1.4% and 1% of the trips were made on foot or by bicycle, respectively. The percentage were much higher in urban areas, amounting to 31.3% for walking and 5.6% for cycling. The percentage of trips made by car was 53.8% in urban areas and 85.8% in suburban ones (Isfort, 2019).====We investigate the determinants of train users’ selection of their feeder mode. As we will discuss more in detail in the Related literature section, the choice process is very complex. It starts with the decision to use the train to reach a given destination and the selection of the train station. Such a decision is intertwined with the selection of the mode to access∖egress the station at the point of departure and at the point of destination (Frei et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2016). The train-feeder mode choice is made among the available alternatives considering a large number of factors such as: the characteristics of the trip in terms of length, time of the day, and route availability (e.g., reserved lanes); the characteristics of the train station, including parking conditions and facilities (e.g., parking restrictions, parking fees, guarded facilities for bicycles); and the characteristics of the train (e.g., frequency, bicycle carrying capacity). Moreover, one should take into account the observed and unobserved (attitudes and perceptions) characteristics of the train user.====To the best of our knowledge, the choice between active and passive modes of transport to reach the railway stations has not been studied with reference to Italy, while it has been researched for countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, France, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and China. Frequently, the train-feeder mode choice has been studied with reference to urban mobility (access to transit∖metro stations) or intercity rail mobility in large urban areas. The number of studies regarding extra-urban areas is more limited (Chan & Farber, 2019; Midenet et al., 2018). In our paper, since Italy is quite densely populated but lacks large metropolitan areas (apart from Rome and Milan), we collected information regarding all types of railways station: located in large, medium and small cities to be as representative as possible of the differing urban and station environments. During the period March–August 2020, we collected information from 185 train users living in a number of Italian Regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont, Tuscany, Liguria, Lazio, and Campania). More than half of the train stations used by our respondents are located in cities smaller than 50 thousand inhabitants, while only 10% are located in cities larger than 200 thousand inhabitants.====From a technical point of view, we collected both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data. Hence, we were able to estimate several models including: a RP multinomial logit (MNL) model, an SP MNL model, a joint RP-SP MNL model and a joint RP-SP mixed logit (MXL) model. We aimed at understanding the motivations of the respondents' current choices and the potential for switching to active mobility provided that suitable infrastructural, economic and policy measures are undertaken. Hence, the estimated models are used to estimate the impact of an increase in the time needed to reach the train station and an increase in the share of cycling lanes or pedestrian lanes on the respondents’ utility and on their train feeder mode choice. The performed simulations lead us to conclude that there is some room for increasing active mobility among Italian train users but it is quite limited: a large part of the respondents appear to be car-captive for several reasons connected to time, cost, personal needs and, not last, the distance between the place of residence and the train station. Extending the network of cycling and pedestrian lanes or discouraging car use might provide some results, but more importantly what is needed is a coordinated effort at many levels, including territorial planning, infrastructural investment and traffic regulation. With specific regards to bicycle use, improving the bicycle-sheltering infrastructure at the train stations has been suggested by many respondents as well as the increase of the bicycle carrying capacity on the main commuting trains.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature on active train feeder modes. Section 3 describes the interview and the current train-feeder mode choices. Section 4 presents the econometric model, whilst Section 5 outlines the results of the estimation of the RP MNL, SP MNL, joint RP-SP MNL and MXL logit models.

There is an extensive body of literature on the assessment of transport impacts in cities, both in terms of their negative external impacts (accidents, trafﬁc congestion, noise, environmental pollution, and spatial segregation) and also in terms of their positive economic benefits, mainly related to travel time savings (Cervero, 2011; Ortúzar & Rizzi, 2007; Vigren & Ljungberg, 2018). However, when evaluating walking as a transport mode, the benefits of promoting a walking environment are typically neglected and are not fully included in the CBA. These effects are not apparent in any market transaction, meaning that it is not possible to determine their economic impact (Elvik, 2000; Sælensminde, 2004), although there are economic benefits in the development of transport systems for active travel.====The conceptual translation of how amenable a neighborhood is to walking, including its environmental quality, safety, comfort, and convenience, is known as walkability. This concept refers to the extent to which the built environment contributes to the presence of people walking, shopping, visiting places, enjoying, or spending time in a specific area (Chatman, 2009; Gilderbloom, Riggs, & Meares, 2015; Pivo & Fisher, 2011; Rauterkus & Miller, 2011). Walkable environments are known to be livelier, and to impact the welfare and quality of life of those who live in these areas. These established benefits attract more individuals to live in a walkable environment, and they are willing to pay more to attain this objective.====A traditional indicator used to evaluate this willingness to pay is the sales price of real estate. Based on the hedonic pricing theory (Rosen, 1974), the property price refers not only to the physical features of real estate but also to the perceived utility of a group of attributes that the buyer acquires with the good. This group of attributes includes the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood, environmental amenities, quality of local services, accessibility, locational attributes and other built environment characteristics the buyer acquires with the residence (Pivo & Fisher, 2011; Rauterkus & Miller, 2011). Hedonic pricing is widely used to evaluate the impact of public transport facilities on real estate values (Cervero & Kang, 2011; Higgins & Kanaroglou, 2016; Sharma & Newman, 2018); however, this approach is not commonly applied to active mode studies.====Although scarce, the literature does contain some studies that use hedonic models to quantify the impacts of walkability on housing prices (Bliesner, Bouton, & Schultz, 2010; Cortright, 2009; Duncan, Aldstadt, Whalen, Melly, & Gortmaker, 2011; Ewing et al., 2013; Gilderbloom et al., 2015; Leinberger & Alfonzo, 2007; Pivo & Fisher, 2011; Rauterkus & Miller, 2011). Their results suggest that walkability adds a premium to the real estate price. These studies significantly contribute to this field; however, they have several limitations regarding the assessment of walkability, the modelling approach used and the context. With regard to the first of these factors, most studies represent walkability using the WalkScore® indicator (====), which assigns a numerical walkability score to an address and awards points based on the distance to nearby amenities, weighted by population density and road metrics such as block length and intersection density (Carr, Dunsiger, & Marcus, 2011). The Walkscore, however, does not consider other characteristics of the local environment such as safety, security, comfort and attractiveness (Arellana, Saltarín, Larranaga, Alvarez, & Henao, 2019). In terms of the modelling approach, the estimation of hedonic models is generally performed using ordinary least squares estimation. The characteristics of built environments are interdependent, potentially creating problems of multicollinearity, and to account for this effect it is important to draw accurate inferences and avoid the risk of over- or underestimating their influence (Handy, 2018). Finally, regarding the context, these studies were undertaken in European and North American cities; no studies have been carried out of the Global South, especially in Latin American context, where the environment, social and economic characteristics differ widely from other places that have been studied. Since data on built environment indices typically vary by region, often restricting comparability (Hirsch, Winters, Clarke, Ste-Marie, & McKay, 2017; Weng et al., 2019), it is important to explore different realities.====This study has four objectives. Firstly, we aim to demonstrate how walkability can be represented by individual perceptions in a Latin American (Brazil). In this study, walkability is assessed based on the residents' perceptions of the built environment and their personal safety and quality of life. Secondly, we aim to demonstrate that an individual's willingness to pay to live in a walkable area is also observable in this context through an analysis of the walkability impact on the sale price of multifamily residential properties. Thirdly, we aim to evaluate whether the existing walkability premium is susceptible to mediating effects. The mediator variables used in these analyses are related to (i) buying opportunities, considering the possible nearby real estate deals; and (ii) walking frequency, as a way to identify whether individuals who walk more often seek to live in more walkable places and are willing to pay for this. Lastly, we aim to compare and discuss the differences in these effects and the structural relation between walkability and other social latent constructs on Global South in two different areas within the Brazilian megacities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.====The two main contributions of this paper are the methodological approach used and the discussion of the particularities of each city used as case study. Our modelling approach is based on the estimation of multigroup Structural Equation Models (SEMs). This approach allows us to consider several perceptions of the characteristics of the built environment, and especially those relevant to the local context, and to account for the correlation between them, thereby overcoming the limitations of other studies. Moderation effects have also never been tested in studies that have evaluated the impact of walkability on real estate prices. Finally, the case study explores a different context from those generally reported in the literature, and our analysis of two study areas may help in determining the effect of the built environment on prices in other urban contexts in Brazil. Identifying and quantifying the differences between socioeconomic groups contributes to urban and transport planning, accounting for disparities between the different contexts. The valuation of these external effects can be used as input for designing sustainable environmental policies (Adkins, Makarewicz, Scanze, Ingram, & Luhr, 2017).====The remainder of this paper is organised into seven sections.

Merchandise trade volume, as measured by the average of exports and imports, grew by 4.7%, marking the first annual increase in excess of 3% since 2011 (World Trade Organization, 2018). The fastest-growing segment was containerized trade, with volumes expanding over nearly four decades at an annual average growth rate of 8.1%, reaching a global volume of 148 million ====s (TEUs) (UNCTAD, 2018).

Per capita Gross Domestic Product or per capita income has remained a benchmark to measure the economic development of county for a long time-period. Human Development Index (HDI) was developed later by taking into considerations features such as access to education and health apart from economic development to address quality of life. Nevertheless, the coefficient of correlation between HDI and per capita GDP was found to be 0.92 for the study of 175 countries (Meier & Rauch, 2012), showing a close connection between economic development and living standards of people. Transport infrastructure is the main device to stimulate the economic development in the region.====Transport sector affects all aspects of human life, education, research, entertainment, trade to manufacturing, culture, and defence. Nations around the world understand its strength in economic development and transmuting resources into knowledge and communication (Mohmand et al., 2017).====There are several views about the impact of infrastructure on economic growth and development in the economic literature; there are undeniable results to rely on (Aschauer, 1989; Fan & Chan-Kang, 2008; Kumar, 2002). Transport infrastructure is considered most important among the different types of infrastructure since transport cost is fundamental in deciding the choice of location for ﬁrms and therefore the economic development of a region (Tariq et al., 2019).====Some of the researchers argue that investment in transport infrastructure is considered as productive government expenditures and a booster of economic growth (Barro, 1990, Myrdal, 1979). However, other researchers indicate that increased government expenditures could slow down the economy by reducing private sector investment (Cameron, 1982; Landau, 2013; Mahmoudzadeh et al., 2013). Banister and Berechman (2001) emphasised that there will be an impact of transport infrastructure in developed countries, if certain investment conditions, political conditions, and economic conditions are met.====The degree of the influence of transportation on the economy is subject to the economic development and differs in developed and developing countries. In some cases, there could be mismatch between immediate benefits and sustainable growth and variation in the scale of its effects over different time-periods. However, the main consent is that transport infrastructure adds to productivity and economic growth, however, it is not fixed over time. In short, transport infrastructure remains vital that enhance economic development (Esfahani & Ramírez, 2003; Phang, 2003; Short & Kopp, 2005; Wang, 2002; Sanchez-Robles, 1998).====Transport infrastructure is a key facilitator in the economic development in the region. The role of transport infrastructure in economic development has been studied broadly in the literature during previous years (Lakshmanan, 2011; Sahoo & Dash, 2009; Yu et al., 2012). As a significant component of physical input, transport infrastructure is not only useful for capital addition but also causing deep effects on economic development.====Investment in the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure like roads, rail and airways are significant elements of the gross domestic product (GDP) (Perkins et al., 2005). A well-organized transport infrastructure can boost economic development by decreasing the passenger and freight transport cost, which helps the expansion of trade (Shi et al., 2016). Furthermore, the decreasing travel time for passenger transport results in progressive effect in labour mobility and creates more employment opportunities. A recent study by Alam et al., 2019, analyzes the effect of CPEC on trade in terms of transport cost and travel time. Their study compares the existing routes and the new CPEC route. The variables (transport cost and travel time) are calculated and compared for both the existing route and new CPEC route. The results show that transport cost for 40-foot container between Kashgar and destination ports in the Middle East is decreased by about $1450 dollars and for destination ports in Europe is decreased by $1350 dollars. Additionally, travel time is decreased by 21–24 days for destination ports in the Middle East and 21 days for destination ports in Europe. The distance from Kashgar to destination ports in the Middle East and Europe is decreased by 11,000 to 13,000 km.",Causality between transportation infrastructure and economic development in Pakistan: An ARDL analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301724,21 October 2020,2020,Research Article,147.0

However, the project will generate positive effects in the economy. The framework used by the EU to figure co-funding rates does not incorporate the flexibility factor. This study uses ==== to assess the investment and its potential impact on the EU's co-financing policy. The hypothesis is that ==== can result in lower co-funding rates compared to the method currently used by the EU. The results support this hypothesis.","Nowadays, the global market prevails with countless commercial trades and freight shipments crossing borders daily. Physical infrastructure plays an increasingly important role in the economic development of regions and countries, particularly for regions like the Azores, which is made up of nine islands with multiple maritime infrastructures. To keep pace with the global market and remain linked to the main routes of maritime transport, the public company that manages the commercial ports of the Azores is performing several restructuring investments for its ports. However, the construction or expansion of a seaport in the Azores is a costly investment and does not create financial value according to the traditional discounted cash flows method (net present value - NPV). The NPV for seaport projects in the Azores is usually negative and close to the same value as the investment costs. In addition, transport projects face several sources of uncertainty, including the state of the local economy (Chambers, 2007).====The Azores is one of the poorest regions of the EU. According to the cohesion policy, investments with positive economic value are eligible for EU co-funding to substantially reduce the investment expenditures made by local authorities. In financial terms, EU co-funding turns the NPV less negative from the local authorities' perspective. According to Portuguese regulations, for projects with investments higher than 25 million euros, the investment needs to be assessed by a cost-benefit analysis that assesses the investment from a financial and economic perspective. To be eligible for co-funding, projects need to have negative Financial Net Present Value (FNPV), both from the investment perspective and from the investor perspective, and positive Economic Net Present Value (ENPV) (European Commission, 2014). The amount of ==== aid will depend on the potential for the project to generate net cash flows that can fund the project itself. The framework used by the EU to assess the financial and economic value of the investment is a traditional discounted cash flow method. In this way, the investment is assessed as “now or never,” with no value coming from the flexibility to delay the investment until any uncertainty is clarified. Flexibility value can be captured using real options analysis (ROA). In this context, it is important to clarify the assumptions made for project financing if ROA is used instead of a traditional discounted cash flow method. This is possible with the Ponta Delgada Port case.====Located on São Miguel Island in the Azores, the commercial port of Ponta Delgada is the main gateway for goods traded with foreign markets and the Portuguese mainland, as well as the distribution hub for the rest of the Azorean islands. The growth of the tourism sector and the increase in the consumption of imported goods in the Azores in recent years requires more modern and versatile support facilities. Following these trends and in accordance with the majority of Azorean economic entities and experts, local authorities foresaw the need to invest in an expansion of the commercial port of Ponta Delgada through the public company responsible for managing all ports in the Azores (Portos dos Açores, S. A). This public company, in addition to be the port authority in the Azores, is also directly involved in the commercial exploration of all ports in the Azores, having its own human resources that can handle all port equipment.====This research shows that the case of the commercial port of Ponta Delgada is consistent with other studies, such as Martins et al. (2017), who demonstrated the flexibility concept through the expansion option with the investment planning of the Ferrol Spanish port. This study also follows the models of Smit (2003) and Oliveira et al. (2020), based on airport and railways investments. To capture the future growth opportunities, it will be assumed that the demand for the Ponta Delgada Port is exogenous and evolves as a binomial process.====The main data was retrieved from the cost-benefit analysis developed for the Ponta Delgada Port expansion (Fundo de Maneio, 2017), and approved by an expert commission on applications for EU funds. This data is also used to compare the results from the flexible scenario of this study. Assessing the investment using ROA, this study then compares it with the traditional discounted cash flow method, considering the assumptions of the EUco-funding policy. To that end, the assessment has been done from three perspectives: the investment perspective, the investor perspective (including the financial aid from the EU), and the economic perspective. The hypothesis is that, with ROA, co-funding rates are lower than the those that rely upon the traditional discounted cash flow method.====Besides the empirical application of ROA to Ponta Delgada Port expansion, following Garvin and Ford (2012) suggestion to test ROA on infrastructure projects to improve the options thinking of managers, this study aims to contribute to the literature on public policy and public funds rational use. Using ROA, projects value rises due different options and decisions incorporation, giving a different perspective to figure co-funding rates.====Following the introduction, the literature review in section 2 discusses the pros and cons of using ROA and how suitable it is for real-life projects, particularly for transport facilities. Next, the non-flexible scenario of the Ponta Delgada Port expansion is presented, as well as its main results. The methodology, results, and discussion follow.

It may relieve people of the costly and non-sustainable burden of owning a car, especially when residing in a city. Though the spread of carsharing may bring significative benefits to (smart) cities, its penetration can be obstructed by non-up-to-date regulations, which can be still tied to a non-smart ==== of mobility. In this study, we provide an overview of remarkable city regulations for carsharing, particularly highlighting the importance that parking policies can have in favouring the diffusion and use of carsharing services. Given such importance, we characterize the optimization problem of a local government that wants to analytically choose the best subset of parking slots to rent to carsharing companies, in order to improve urban mobility. To model and solve the problem we propose a new Binary Linear Programming problem and genetic-based matheuristic. Finally, we present results from computational tests referring to realistic data of the Italian city of Rome, showing that our optimization approach can return a fair territorial distribution of the parking slots, satisfying various families of constraints limiting the distribution.","In recent times, smart mobility systems have attracted a lot of attention, since they are considered a fundamental component of modern smart cities, as recognized by national and international establishments and by major companies active in the landscape of digital economy (e.g., Benevolo et al., 2016; EU-INEA 2017). A ==== (SMOB) system can be defined as a strongly Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-supported Transport System (e.g., GeSi-ACN 2015; Kenny, 2013). ICT is a crucial component of SMOB systems, which enables a continuous connection between the system administrators, the customers/users and the mobile and fixed infrastructures. Furthermore, it represents a key building block for offering innovative trustable and sustainable ways to move in urban and extra-urban scenarios. A major example of SMOB is represented by ==== services. Nowadays, carsharing is intended as a mobility service that allows a user to rent a car for very short period of times (e.g., a few minutes) using a smartphone application and paying a per-minute fee (Weikl & Bogenberger, 2013). Such services have contributed to revolutionize urban mobility in the last decade, basing their success also on the strong diffusion of smartphones.====It is now widely recognized that carsharing and other SMOB systems can have a (very) positive impact on the quality of life in urban and extra-urban scenarios, sensibly reducing the negative sides of transport systems (e.g., pollution caused by traffic, road congestion). For an overview of the benefits of SMOB, we refer the reader to (Bencardino & Greco, 2014; Benevolo et al., 2016; Carrese et al., 2017, 1996, 2020; Hessel, 2015; Lyons, 2016). Some studies have tried to precisely assess this positive impact. For example, Martin and Shaheen (2011) showed that the introduction of carsharing in North America led to a decrease in the average number of vehicles per family from 0.47 to 0.24 and that, on average, each shared car substituted from 9 to 12 private cars. Besides the positive impact on environment and economy, carsharing and other SMOB systems have a positive social impact too. Indeed, a considerable part of the costs that road transportation entails does not appear as internal costs borne by the drivers, but is taken into account as external costs (e.g., environmental impact) borne by the collectivity. Such external costs represent a third of the total and about 90% of them is due to private car owners (Lombard et al., 2005). Within this context, carsharing and other SMOB systems present features that can ease the internalization of costs, since they support the passage from privately-owned cars to ====, based on the concept of ====.====Though their benefits are pretty evident and clear, SMOB systems have found difficulties in being implemented. This is due to various reasons, such as: 1) the presence of regulatory frameworks that are often confused and not up-to-date for welcoming new innovative SMOB digital platforms and services; 2) the inertness of policy makers, which may ineffectively support the expansion of SMOB services, thus dooming them to remain just at an experimental and very low-scale level.====In recent years, among SMOB systems, carsharing has attracted particular attention and has been the subject of intense research from many point of views. Recent research studies have been aimed at better quantifying the benefits of carsharing, such as how it contributes to reduce the need for a private car (Becker et al., 2018) and how it favours the penetration and adoption of electric vehicles (see e.g., Meisel & Merfeld, 2018). Other studies have evaluated how different reservation mechanisms of shared cars may be used to influence user behaviour (e.g., Wu et al., 2019 analyze how users respond to different reservation schemes adopted for tackling imbalances between supply and demand in free-floating carsharing).====A major topic of investigations has been represented by the development of methods for choosing where to locate charging stations for electric carsharing. Limiting our attention to some more recent works, we recall the studies: (Cheng et al., 2019), which proposes to combine statistical models with machine learning techniques not only to identify sites for deploying new charging stations, but also for adjusting the location of stations already deployed; (Chen et al., 2018), which analyzes the performance of regression models for evaluating how station features, city environment and transportation facilities affect carsharing services and proposes a method for deciding the location of stations; (Wang et al., 2019), which develops a four-step method that first estimates and distributes charging demand of electric vehicles in a city and then establishes the location of normal and fast charging stations for both private and shared vehicles; (Biondi et al., 2016), which proposes an optimization approach for establishing the cost-optimal location and capacity of charging stations, using queueing theory for expressing the demand of recharge; finally (Li et al., 2017), proposes a multi-criteria decision approach, including factors like travel purposes and distance from existing stations, for optimally locating carsharing stations and tests its performance on EVCARD, the electric carsharing system of Shanghai.====Another major topic of investigations has been represented by the problem of relocating vehicles, which can sensibly increase the profit of carsharing, as highlighted in the recent survey (Illgen & Höck, 2019) and in other works such as: 1) (Boyaci et al., 2017), which proposes a simulation-optimization approach for a station-based one-way carsharing system that provides for reservations and relocations; 2) (Bruglieri et al., 2018), which proposes a two-phase heuristic for solving a 3-objective carsharing relocation problem, considering cost minimization, fair distribution maximization and service level maximization; 3) (Zhao et al., 2018), which focuses on optimally managing vehicle rebalancing and staff relocation in a station-based one-way carsharing system, proposing an innovative algorithm combining Lagrangian relaxation and dynamic programming for its solution.====In the present work, we review some major city carsharing regulations, highlighting the importance of adopting reserved parking slots for carsharing vehicles. Also, we propose a mathematical optimization model and algorithm for establishing where to put reserved parking slots at disposal of carsharing users. The reserved parking slots are simple parking spaces meant to be spread around a city more pervasively of renting/charging stations. Their essential purpose is to speed up the parking phase of a rent, reducing the cruising time needed by a carsharing user for finding an empty slot. Specifically, our major contributions are the following:====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

This paper therefore has examined the impact of road transport infrastructure investment on Uganda's economic performance and also quantified the economic costs associated with inefficient urban road transport infrastructure network for the case of Uganda. The paper utilizes a rich econometric methodology involving the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) to estimate the impact of road transport infrastructure and economic growth as well as traffic counts of travel East bound (EB) and West Bound (WB) for the major roads leading to Kampala Capital City to estimate the generalized cost of travel as the city represents more than 70% of the total national vehicle traffic/population. The quantification of gains and costs provided a benchmark to inform further policy processes, planning, and ====.====The ARDL bound test results confirmed the existence cointegration of variables although the variables were integrated of different orders. The results of empirical ARDL indicated that investment in road transport infrastructure has both short and long run significant impact on economic growth of Uganda. In the long run, the study finds that investment in road transport infrastructure has a positive and significant impact on economic growth. But in the short run, the impact is actually negative. The paper finds that, a 1 percentage point increase in investment in road transport infrastructure increases economic growth by 0.062 percentage points in the long run. On the other hand, a 1 percentage point increase in investment in road transport infrastructure reduces economic growth in the 1st year of the increase in the expenditure by 0.089 percentage points but (Gross Domestic Product) GDP increases by 7.5 percentage points in the second year. This implies that, the impact of road transport infrastructure investment on economic growth occurs with lags for the case of Uganda. Evidence also justifies presence of significant economic benefits due to massive investments in the urban transport infrastructure network through express highways and associated roads especially within the Greater Kampala ====, municipal authorities and future transport planning for new cities.====The main conclusion of this paper is that, with the current state of traffic flow, the country loses about 6.7% of its GDP due to traffic congestion annually. Therefore, projects such as; Kampala flyover project, Entebbe Express Highway, Southern Bypass, Northern Bypass, Kampala Bombo Express Highway, Kampala Jinja Express Highway and Kibuye Mpigi Express highway together with associated urban roads improvements that are planned for seamless flow of traffic within the Greater Kampala ==== (GKMA) are highly justified. These projects should be prioritized, fast-tracked and developed in a concurrent manner to realize the intended results. Further, the negative short run impact of infrastructure spending on growth implies the need to rebalance public spending to also prioritize social sectors.","The impact of infrastructure==== development on Uganda's economic performance cannot be under-estimated especially with regard to enhancing the country's competitiveness through easing the cost of doing business. Infrastructure deficits in most African economies have increased the transaction costs of doing business and these deficits are estimated to annually cost at least 2 percent of Africa's growth. On the other hand, an additional 1% (one percent) of GDP investment in transportation on a sustained basis increases the GDP per capita growth rate by 0.6 percent. Indeed, with adequate infrastructure, African firms could achieve productivity gains of up to 40 percent (Ondiege & Verdier-chouchane, 2013).====Therefore, investment in road transport infrastructure has associated gains with deficiencies in infrastructure associated with significant socio-economic costs. Particularly, among other gains, entrepreneurs are able to get their goods and services to markets in a cheaper, secure and timely manner, and encourages Foreign Direct Investment (Schwab, 2015a, Schwab, 2015b). This doesn't negate the need to invest in complementary infrastructure like sufficient electricity supplies. Among the key costs of inadequate infrastructure investment is the cost of waiting time. Higher value of waiting time implies loss in productive time and hence hinders the country's growth potential.====Further, inadequacies in transport infrastructure are likely to crowd out the gains brought about by improvements in other infrastructure. For example, although investments in an extensive and efficient telecommunication network allow for quick flow of information, something that increases overall economic efficiency (Matalqah & Warad, 2017), inadequacies in transport infrastructure are likely to crowd out the gains brought about by improvements in telecommunications due to loss of reliability in business supply chains.====With regard to East Africa, sufficient infrastructure is required and crucial for regional economic integration (Njoh, 2018). The process for deep integration will be realized if the required infrastructure network is developed across the region. With such infrastructure investment, East Africa will be able to compete effectively, tap into other regional markets, and benefit from globalization through investment and trade. This therefore calls for the construction of efficient and secure national and cross-border physical infrastructure.====Overall, Infrastructure is critical for the promotion of inclusive and sustainable growth (National Planning Authority, 2015). An efficient urban transport system is critical for addressing the transport bottlenecks of the urban poor, reduces the cost of urban travel and hence increases savings for other welfare enhancing amenities of the urban poor.====Transport infrastructure investment has of late attracted the attention of researchers and policy makers regionally and globally. Several empirical studies have thus tried to empirically examine the linkage between road transport infrastructure investments and economic growth (CP.Ng et al., 2019; Priviledge, 2013; Tripathi & Gautam, 2010) among others and the results are mixed, thus the debate is still inconlcusive. For example, CP. Ng et al., (2019) analyse the contribution of road infrastructure development and other socio-economic factors that contribute to economic growth in selected counties. They conducted Fixed-effects panel linear regression using timeseries cross-sectional data for 60 countries over the period of 3 decades from 1980 to 2010. Their study finds that growth in road length per thousand population contribute positively to economic growth. They observed an inverted U-shaped dependency relationship between urbanization and economic growth. The growth in road length per thousand population would facilitate export growth in their conclusion. Priviledge (2013) examines the impact of transport infrastructure investment and transport sector productivity on South African economic growth for the period 1975–2011 by adopting a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) empirical tools of analysis. The models provided an insight into the dynamic shocks on economic growth through impulse responses. In their study, the VECM results showed that economic growth is influenced by inflation, domestic fixed transport investments, and real exchange rate, yet on the BVAR model it was influenced by inflation, domestic fixed transport investments, multi factor productivity, real exchange rate and second period Gross Domestic Product. This implied that transport infrastructure investment has a positive impact on economic growth of South Africa.====Tripathi and Gautam (2010) examines the relationship between road transport infrastructure and long-run equilibrium macroeconomic variables such as output using a framework of vector autoregression (VAR). They find that, the elasticities that are estimated in the VAR model differ from the production function elasticities and were found to incorporate feedback effect between the variables in the model, as opposed to the ‘ceteris paribus’ elasticities which are estimated in production function studies.====The above studies and others notwithstanding, and given the enormous importance of infrastructure development, limited research has been done to explore the linkage between infrastructure investment and economic growth for the case of Uganda. As such the country still has inadequate stock of infrastructure and infrastructure remains the binding constraint to increasing returns to public investment in Uganda. It is no wonder all National Development Plans of the Country prioritize infrastructure spending particularly the road network. And for Africa in general, a considerable investment in infrastructure that uses innovative sources of funding is needed to address the low level of competitiveness. The Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) estimates that Africa will need to invest up to US$93 billion annually until 2020 for both capital investment and maintenance. Thus, governments will need to be innovative in the search for sustainable approaches to infrastructure development as well as financing (Ondiege & Verdier-chouchane, 2013).====The overall purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of road transport infrastructure investment on Uganda's economic performance as well as quantify the economic costs associated with inefficient urban road transport infrastructure network. This quantification of gains and costs is expected to provide a benchmark to inform further policy processes, planning, and feasibility studies. This paper comes at a time when the country through the Second National Development Plan (2015–2020) prioritized frontloading infrastructure investment especially road transport and has also been prioritized in the third (National Planning Authority, 2020).====To realize this, an infrastructure investment of over Ushs.60.4 trillion ($ 16.6 billion) an equivalent of 30% of the entire Second National Development Plan (NDPII) Costs will be needed between 2016 and 2020 in capital investments and maintenance with over 70% in Works and Transport. Out of this, Public Costs are expected to constitute over 60% total investment (National Planning Authority, 2015). Particularly for Kampala the Capital of Uganda, an investment of about $ 2.3 Bn is expected to be invested in express highways alone in five years through various financing mechanisms. Among these include; Kampala-Jinja Express Highway, Kibuye-Busega-Mpigi Express Highway, Kampala-Entebbe Express Highway, Kampala-Bombo Express Highway, together with construction of major road links and access roads within the city (NPA, 2015; UNRA, 2016). However, despite this investment, no study has comprehensively studied the costs associated with dilapidated transport infrastructure and the expected gains due to improvements in infrastructure.====Therefore, this paper is to examine the impact of these road transport infrastructure investments==== on economic performance in Uganda as well as estimate the economic cost of inadequate urban transport network.",Socio-economic impacts of transport infrastructure investment in Uganda: Insight from frontloading expenditure on Uganda's urban roads and highways,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301694,5 October 2020,2020,Research Article,152.0

They also involve long construction lead times. Therefore, choosing the timing and size of port investments appropriately to serve trade growth is important. This paper presents a ==== model to value the option of single-phase (service) port expansions with flexible investment timing and size under uncertainty. The model moreover takes the construction lead time into account. This model allows comparing investment in the expansion of a port already operating and generating revenues with an investment in a greenfield project. An existing port has incentives to protect users from congestion resulting in delays and to protect their port revenues. Therefore, the higher the port users’ aversion to waiting, the earlier the port is expanded and the smaller the expansion. Oppositely, in a greenfield project, increased waiting-time aversion leads to projects being undertaken later and being larger. The impact of increased time to build on both the investment timing and size is ambiguous, since this construction lead time increases uncertainty, but at the same time also reduces the present value of cash flows. Increased public ownership leads to earlier investment, but not necessarily more capacity.","Port activities play an important role in international and regional trade and maritime transportation. Moreover, they make up a significant part of the worldwide economic activity. In order to perform these port activities, port capacity is required. The capacity of a port, often expressed as the number of ships or the amount of cargo that can be processed in a certain time period, is determined by many interrelated elements, such as maritime and hinterland access, infrastructure (e.g., docks), superstructure and equipment (e.g., cranes) (Vanelslander, 2014; Verhoeven, 2015). According to UNCTAD (2015) and De Langen, Turró, Fontanet, and Caballé, (2018) the demand for cargo handling is uncertain but growing. This especially holds for the container trade segment. Due to the uncertain arrivals of ships, congestion and waiting time might build up at some moments, followed by periods of empty berths. The resulting congestion poses a problem to the shipping companies, as congestion causes different costs, as well as to the ports, who need to reschedule their operations (Balliauw, Kort, Meersman, Van de Voorde, & Vanelslander, 2020; Blauwens, De Baere, & Van de Voorde, 2016). As a result of waiting-time averse shipping companies, the port risks losing clients and/or profit when the available capacity is insufficient. Other consequences involve a slowdown of the economy, decreased GDP and increased trade distances and freight delays. To avoid such negative effects, ports are required to sufficiently invest in the elements determining capacity (Kauppila, Martinez, Merk, & Benezec, 2016). According to a survey of De Langen et al. (2018) and subsequent extrapolations by these authors, investments of about 50 billion euro are needed in the European ports in the period 2018–2027. Of these projects, about 70% involve capacity expansions (De Langen et al., 2018).====The majority of the theoretical literature on port capacity investments considers greenfield projects, i.e. ports that are built from scratch (Xiao, Ng, Yang, & Fu, 2012). One of the counter-intuitive findings in this setting is that higher congestion costs, as a result of customers’ higher value of time,==== lead to delaying the investment in a new port, which would be larger though (Balliauw, Kort, & Zhang, 2019). In reality however, the majority of port capacity investment projects encompass expansion projects. Chen and Liu (2016) are one of the few authors studying port expansion investments in a theoretical way. However, they do not account for the current design capacity level of the port either. In the Hamburg-Le Havre range, many examples of expansion projects in ports of different sizes are present, e.g. Maasvlakte 2 in Rotterdam and the planned Saeftinghe dock in Antwerp. The question remains if increased waiting-time aversion leads to delaying capacity expansions of already active ports as well. One could expect that the management of the port would have an incentive to anticipate the investment in such a case, in order to reduce the congestion already present when the instrument of congestion pricing cannot be exploited any further in a profitable way. This is opposed to a greenfield port project.====Additionally, it takes a lot of time to build large infrastructure projects such as port capacity investment projects (Aguerrevere, 2003; Meersman & Van de Voorde, 2014a; Vanelslander, 2014). This period between making the investment and project completion, which coincides with the start of the operation of the newly added capacity, is defined here as the construction lead time. During this construction lead time, the performance of the market and hence the project's profitability could change due to the uncertainty of demand. This also has an impact on a port's investment decision and needs to be considered. However, it is assumed here that the construction, also referred to as installation, of the additional capacity has no impact on the operation of the already existing port facilities. This is plausible when the port is expanded with large docks directly accessible from the sea or river (with or without an additional lock).====In order to analyse investment decisions under uncertainty, the real options (RO) approach is better suited than the more traditional net present value approach (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). Even if uncertainty is low or absent, the Net Present Value (NPV) rule can be (very) wrong, due to its underlying assumption that investing in an irreversible project is a now-or-never decision. In reality, managers have the flexibility to postpone the investment, e.g. in order to gain more information about the uncertain environment. This underlying option has a value that is overlooked by the NPV rule. Real options models offer a more appropriate method to evaluate flexible investments under uncertainty and make better investment decisions. RO models monetarily quantify the value of managerial flexibility to react to uncertainty in the best possible way. Only when these options are considered in project appraisal, the investment decision can be valued correctly. To this end, RO models use stochastic calculus and dynamic programming to optimise an objective function including a random term with respect to the investment decision variables (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).====The available RO literature considering some amount of construction lead time and studying its impact by comparing with cases where the time to build is zero, is however rather limited. Although Dixit and Pindyck (1994) and Kydland and Prescott (1982) already indicated the important implications of time to build on investment decisions, Marmer and Slade (2018) more recently argued again that investment lags should be given more attention in theoretical and empirical work. In his study for non-storable commodities, Aguerrevere (2003) found an ambiguous relationship between the time to build and the size of the investment project. Moreover, he found that introducing time to build leads to the observation that firms anticipate their capacity expansion to moments before current capacity is fully occupied. Also Bar-Ilan and Strange (1996) found that longer construction times lead to earlier investments in a production environment. Moreover, time to build influences the effect of uncertainty on the timing of the investment. Whereas traditional RO analysis demonstrates that increased uncertainty leads to delaying the investment, increased uncertainty in combination with time to build may lead in some cases to anticipating the investment timing. This illustrates the importance of considering time to build in the model. Furthermore, Majd and Pindyck (1987) and Milne and Whalley (2000) quantified the option value of altering the construction lead time through the use of a different technology.====The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of time to build and the (theoretical design) capacity already in place on the port capacity expansion decision under uncertainty. In this paper, the port under consideration, which can be owned privately, publicly or by a combination of both types of owners, has the option to invest in one port expansion project,==== which is fully deployed in one phase.==== The project consists of expansion of the port infrastructure (e.g., dock and quay walls) and the irreversible elements of the superstructure (e.g., pavements) at this dock. To value this investment option, a continuous time and continuous state RO approach is used. Since growth, uncertainty, public money involvement and congestion considerably influence the investment decision, the impact of changes in these economic characteristics on the investment decision needs to be studied as well. These additions to the academic literature will allow practitioners to make well-considered port investment decisions, taking into account as much relevant information as possible.====In order to focus on the impact of time to build on the (unrestricted) optimal expansion decision of a port, port competition is left beyond the scope of this paper. The same holds for the division between terminal operators and the port authority in a landlord port. Focusing on a service port, which is owned and operated by one single actor, namely the port authority (PA), and omitting competition allows for better mathematical tractability of the model. Moreover, it allows to compare the results from this paper with the results of Balliauw et al. (2020), who present a base case for the model used in this paper. In order to extend this paper's model to a duopoly case, the approach of Balliauw, Kort, and Zhang (2019) and Huisman and Kort (2015) can be followed. In case of small cost differences, inter-port competition and resulting preemption strategies drive the option value down. This leads to an anticipated investment timing of the first investor, the leader in a Stackelberg leader-follower competition model. If at the moment of investment, the market is too small to be served by additional ports, the leader will deter investment of the other port, denominated the follower. If the market is large enough for two active ports, the size of the leader's investment will be smaller in order to accommodate the investment of the follower port. The insights from a landlord port can be retrieved from Balliauw et al., 2020 and are complementary to the investment optima found in this paper.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the basic model to determine the value of an investment in port capacity expansion involving time to build. The analysis starts from the more easy-to-analyse greenfield project without time to build, to subsequently introduce and focus on the specific implications of considering time to build in expansion projects. Section 3 describes how the optimal investment thresholds are determined according to the real options approach. The parameters used for the numerical simulations are given in Section 4, followed by a discussion of the results in Section 5. The final section gives the main conclusions and presents avenues for future research.",Time to build: A real options analysis of port capacity expansion investments under uncertainty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592030127X,3 October 2020,2020,Research Article,153.0

Despite the many advantages of transport infrastructure, it also has severe consequences for the environment as the usage of fossil fuels result in the emissions of CO==== emissions, implying a rise in emissions as a result of economic growth and improvement of infrastructure. The results also exhibit that, in the long run, a bidirectional relationship exist between economic growth and infrastructure. Also, a unidirectional causality exists from economic growth, infrastructure and consumption to emissions. Hence, economic growth leads to an increase in infrastructure and emissions with feedback. The results of this research provide valuable insight for the country as an investment of around US $ 11 billion is made to the development and improvement of transport infrastructure in the context of China Pakistan Economic Corridor aiming to achieve growth through transport investments. The results suggest an increase in emissions in a country which is already suffering from climate change. Therefore, policies need to be developed which while encouraging infrastructure development, also focus on the protection of the environment, and control emissions.","Transport sector of a country is a significant component of the economy and an engine for growth and development. This sector becomes more important in today's globalized world, where economic opportunities are, to an increasing extent, linked to the mobility of information, goods, and people (Rodrigue & Notteboom, 2017, p. 440). An efficient and well-designed transport system promotes economic growth by trade facilitation: it decreases the costs associated with domestic production as it improves economies of scale in the production process, market integration, expeditious shipment of raw materials, and generates a network of communication amongst people. The improvement of transport infrastructure is also a key element that results in efficient allocation of resources, allowing firms to have a nurturing business environment and, hence, ensuring higher returns from business ventures. Additionally, government spending on transport infrastructure augments an economy's competitive advantage in producing goods, thus promoting trade, alongside boosting tourism and foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as generating numerous employment opportunities (Ahmed, Abbas, & Ahmed, 2013). This, in turn, increases disposable income and acts as an investment multiplier by increasing demand in associated industries.====The connection between transport infrastructure investments and economic growth and vice versa gathered considerable attention of researchers over the last few decades (Banister, 2012; Banister & Berechman, 2001; Calderón & Servén, 2007; Canning & Bennathan, 2007; Crafts, 2009; Deng, 2013; Lakshmanan, 2011; Mohmand, Wang, & Saeed, 2017; Munnell, 1992; Rodrigue & Notteboom, 2017, p. 440; Sahoo & Dash, 2009; Yu, De Jong, Storm, & Mi, 2012). Among these studies, perhaps the first to investigate this domain was the research by (Aschauer, 1989). The author suggested a positive relationship between economic growth and infrastructure. Holtz-Eakin and Schwartz (1995) examined the productivity spillover of US highways but found no significant support for the same. Following this, taking Mexico as a case, Lachler and Aschauer (1998) suggested that increasing investments in transport infrastructure does not guarantee economic growth, hence investments in transport alone are not sufficient. Following this, researchers started exploring and introducing additional variables which may possibly explain the linkages between transportation and economic growth.====Despite the many advantages of transport infrastructure, it also has severe consequences for the environment as the fossil fuel consumption leads to emissions of carbon dioxide gas (CO====). Due to advancements in human mobility, urbanization and increased industrialization, the global demand for fossil fuels has increased i.e. from nearly zero in the year 1870 to 33 gigatons in 2015 (IEA, 2017), causing the average global temperature to rise. There has been a 68 percent increase in CO==== emissions==== from the year 1990–2015, which is solely attributed to the transport sector as evident from Fig. 1.====Notwithstanding the detrimental consequences of fossil fuel led growth, there are limited options for developing countries like Pakistan, whose investments in transportation and industries are important determinants of economic growth. The economic growth and ease of mobility lead to urbanization, which increases but simultaneously congests, the use of the transport network. This subsequently increases transport energy consumption and transport carbon emissions. These emissions evidently play a significant role in climate change, which leads to degradation of road infrastructure. Evidently, a strong connection exists between transport infrastructure investments, economic growth and development, transport fuel consumption and transport carbon emissions. Although there is extensive research available on the relationship between economic growth, fuel consumption and carbon emissions, yet very few have collectively investigated the effect of transport related infrastructure on economic growth, transport energy consumption and transport carbon emissions. Further according to the authors’ knowledge, no research has been done in this domain taking the case of Pakistan. As such, the motivation behind this research is to investigate whether investment in transport is the key to economic growth and at the same time, causing environmental degradation. Such a research is essential as it can provide several key insights for different stakeholders. The country has been pursuing economic growth and development through rigorous investment of billions of dollars in transport particularly road infrastructure improvement as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which is a flagship project of One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR). The positive and significant effect of infrastructure on economic growth will indicate that it is prudent to invest public funds on developing local infrastructure for overall economic growth. Furthermore, a positive and significant relation between transport and carbon emissions can help design policies accordingly not only for this country but also for other OBOR participants.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the current transport infrastructure in Pakistan is briefly presented in Section 2, literature review is discussed in Section 3, followed by the data and methodology in Section 4. The empirical estimation and results are presented in Section 5, followed by conclusions.","Investigating the causal relationship between transport infrastructure, economic growth and transport emissions in Pakistan",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301700,1 October 2020,2020,Research Article,154.0

We analyse this relationship applying vector error correction models, ====, and impulse response analyses. We employ multiple model specifications to study the impact of private vs. public capital as well as physical capital stocks vs. monetary capital stocks on economic growth. In models including private capital stocks, we find support for the production function relation as causality goes from infrastructure to GDP. In models that include public capital stocks, causality goes from GDP to transport investments, thus favouring Wagner's law. Therefore we conclude that focusing on a good legal environment for private investors seems to be a good option for promoting growth in Pakistan.","Public infrastructure stock in Pakistan has grown in the last decades but at a very low rate (Loayza & Wada, 2012). Not only has Pakistan a low density of roads or railroads, but also the quality of transport infrastructure is relatively low compared to neighboring countries like China and India.==== The share of GDP invested in transport infrastructure of approximately 2% is relatively low compared to other Asian countries.==== Infrastructure in Pakistan has traditionally been financed by the public sector and by foreign aid (Javid, 2019). In developing countries public sector investment often lacks efficiency because of corruption and poor institutions. Moreover due to increasing budget constraints, governments have started to set up public private partnerships in order to get access to private financing sources (Ahmed et al., 2013). Data collected by the world bank shows that investment in transport with private participation has increased in many Asian countries.==== Because private investor involvements also need a legal framework that is both difficult for developing countries to set up and to monitor (Ahmed et al., 2013), private infrastructure capital is not an easy solution to financing problems either.====Pakistan is currently faced with huge investments in transport infrastructure in the context of the CPEC which is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. For this reason, it is important to explore the role of private and public transport infrastructure capital in economic growth in Pakistan and evaluate whether the country can profit from these investments.====Investment in infrastructure is seen as an important source of economic growth, especially in developing countries (Straub et al., 2008, p. 4589). Transport infrastructure projects can cause positive externalities such as enlarging the market, achieving gains from trade, promoting inter-regional integration, disseminating knowledge and technology, increasing specialization, and improving production and distribution processes (Lakshmanan, 2011; Magazzino & Valeri, 2012). Firm's and household's choices of location crucially depend on the infrastructure in respective areas. While firms are more dependent on high quality roads, as well as electricity-, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, private households are also interested in the availability of schools and hospitals. Nonetheless, all economic entities benefit from good infrastructure, as it lowers transaction and transport costs (Straub, 2008). Consequently, following the line of reasoning of the neoclassical growth theory, investment in infrastructure should promote economic growth eventually (Barro & Sala-i-Martin, 1992; Romer, 1994).====Conversely, economic growth also leads to an increase in profits and earnings and this stimulates public and private investment activity. However, it remains unsettled whether money is invested productively which has for instance already been questioned for investments of the Belt and Road Initiative (Ansar et al., 2016). Following this line of reasoning, Wagner's Law provides an explanation for increasing public expenditure due to economic growth, which has been confirmed in empirical literature as well, for example by Wagner (1958) and Lamartina and Zaghini (2010).====There are reasons for investment stimulating growth and also for growth stimulating investment. Policy implications, however, differ significantly for the two directions of causality. If transport capital enhances growth, funds should be allocated to transport infrastructure projects. If growth increases capital accumulation, creating jobs and increasing productivity should be given priority (Maparu & Mazumder, 2017). However, it is also important to compare the productivity of transport infrastructure to the potential returns of other infrastructure types.====To identify these drivers of economic growth, we estimate the relationship between GDP, labour force, transport infrastructure, and other infrastructure, so as to specify a production function type model for Pakistan. Firstly, in contrast to most of the similar papers (Ghani & Din, 2006; Maparu & Mazumder, 2017; Mohmand, Wang, & Saeed, 2017; Pradhan & Baghi, 2013; Rehman et al., 2010), we additionally include human capital proxies to investigate production function relations. Secondly, related papers either employ physical or monetary infrastructure aggregates or a mixture of both. We construct similar aggregates for physical infrastructure (non-transport and transport) and monetary infrastructure (non-transport and transport) and compare their productivity. Differences in the productivity of monetary investments and real outcome (physical infrastructure) reveal inefficiencies in infrastructure provision. Thirdly, in contrast to Rehman et al. (2010) and Mohmand et al. (2017), we are able to differentiate between public and private capital (Javid, 2019), both for transport and non-transport infrastructure. By calculating these four capital stocks, we are able to directly address the question of whether private or public capital is more productive.====We find that it is more economically rewarding for Pakistan to establish a good investment environment for private companies, instead of relying on public funds, at least if public infrastructure provision is not improved in future. Non-transport infrastructure and transport infrastructure both seem to be important. We find causality from the inputs of the production function (labour, transport capital, and other capital) to GDP in models with physical and monetary private capital stocks. Contrarily, in models with monetary public capital stocks, we find no stable long-run relationship between the variables. Granger-Causality analysis reveals causality from GDP to public investments in line with Wagner's law. Public authorities seem to have invested in infrastructure in times of economics upswings, while these investments have not led to economic growth.====We start the analysis by reviewing the literature in Section 2, mainly focusing on recent single-country time series analyses for Asian countries. The econometric method is outlined in Section 3. Section 4 comprises the data, describes the construction of infrastructure aggregates and the presents the unit root tests. The results of the empirical analysis are presented and discussed in Section 5. Section 5.1 contains the results of the Vector Error Correction Models (VECMs). Section 5.2 presents the results of the Granger-Causality tests and Section 5.3 sheds light on the interaction of private and public transport capital by investigating impulse response functions. Models in Sections 5.1 Long-run relationships, 5.2 The following models are estimated, 5.3 Granger-Causality have been checked for robustness and respective results are presented in the appendix. Section 6 concludes.",The role of public and private transport infrastructure capital in economic growth.

Empirical results suggest that 1) although HSR opening can significantly promote tourist arrivals, the multi-stage DID model indicates a time-lag effect of HSR on tourism. 2) The positive effects of HSR opening on tourist arrivals increase gradually. 3) Improving HSR frequency helps cities to attract more tourists. 4) The location of ==== has no significant impact on tourist arrivals. 5) Compared with the ordinary station, the hub station of HSR in the city can attract more tourist arrivals through an enhanced network effect.","The cost of building a new High-Speed Railway (HSR) line by the government is too high, which requires empirical research on its economic and social benefits (Guirao & Campa, 2015). For instance, the construction cost of HSR in China is 17 million to 21 million US dollars per kilometer, compared with 25 million to 38 million US dollars in Japan and Europe.==== Tourism is a fundamental industry in many countries and tends to increase the demand for HSR. As a consequence, implementing new HSR lines by the government needs to concentrate on the benefits of tourism (Guirao & Campa, 2015). The role played by HSR in tourism industry has captured increasing attention of researchers and policymakers. Travel time compression due to HSR opening is assumed to enhance the accessibility and competitiveness of HSR-served cities, causing a significant impact on tourism (Masson & Petiot, 2009). The first works in Spain focused on the relation between tourism and HSR, which started with the line Madrid-Toledo (Guirao & Soler, 2008). They find that the capacity of HSR can meet the needs of tourists during weekdays by using questionnaires. If the demand for HSR of tourists raises in the future, the HSR operating companies will be forced to meet these needs by increasing the number of trains. However, these problems will not occur on weekends. Currently, most studies concentrate on European cases, especially HSR in Spain (Pagliara et al., 2015; Albalate; Fageda, 2016; Guirao; Campa, 2016; Campa et al., 2016; Albalate et al., 2017). Specifically, on the one hand, some literature suggests that HSR has an impact on tourism, but not much. Based on the data of the Spanish National Statistical Institute, Albalate and Fageda (2016) apply the Difference-in-Difference (DID) model to investigate the impact of HSR on tourism. The results indicate that HSR may have a positive impact on tourism, but the influence is weak. Campa et al. (2016) evaluate the impact of HSR in Spain on tourism through a fixed-effect model. The results present a positive correlation between growth in tourism output (foreign arrivals and revenues) and HSR networks, but the impact is also small. Albalate et al. (2017) analyze the relation between the HSR program and local tourism development in Spain by using the DID model. The findings show that the impact of these HSR programs on tourism is exceedingly weak or just restricted to the larger cities. On the other hand, some studies argue that the influence of HSR on tourism is still controversial. Pagliara et al. (2015) apply logistic regression models to examine the impact of Spanish HSR on travel motivation and behavioral intention of tourists. The results reveal that HSR has not significantly increased the attractiveness of the capital Madrid to tourists. However, it has greatly enhanced the attraction of the cities along the HSR around Madrid to tourists. Guirao and Campa (2016) take Spain as an example to investigate the impact of HSR on tourism demand by using a multiple regression model with panel data. The results imply that the influence of HSR on tourism demand is still disputable, and there is no clear empirical evidence. In addition, previous studies have explored the impact of China's HSR on tourism. For instance, Hou (2019) evaluates the impact of China's HSR on tourism by generalized DID model and a dose-response (DR) assessment. The results make clear that HSR programs have a positive effect on the development of tourism on average. Yin et al. (2019) discuss the tourism spatial interaction at the current HSR network and the future. They take the capital region of China as an example. The main result is that extending the HSR network in the future scenario will significantly increase the overall tourism spatial interaction and reduce spatial differences. Unfortunately, Hou (2019) utilizes Easy Professional Superior (EPS) data,==== which is a database operated by a private company. There are some problems with the data source. Yin et al. (2019) only employ the Coefficient of Variation (CV) method for research. The methodology is too superficial to reveal the impact of HSR on tourism.====Plenty of literature has carried out a detailed analysis and evaluation on the tourism performance of HSR. However, there are several areas still worthy of further exploration. 1) Due to the different samples used, previous studies have some controversies on the relation between HSR program and tourism. Whether HSR really promotes tourism still needs to be carefully and profoundly tested. 2) The existing studies only apply the DID model to identify the impact on tourism before and after the opening of HSR, but ignores when the HSR will affect tourism after the opening? The HSR configurations (e.g. frequency, station location and class) may also show different impacts on tourism, but few studies have took these variables into consideration. 3) Less empirical evidence is provided in the Asian context. Particularly, existing empirical studies still lack authoritative data from China.====As the largest tourism market in the world, China has constructed the world's largest HSR network and is still expanding (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In 2017, the total tourism revenue in China achieves 5.40 trillion ==== an increase of 15.1% year on year.==== In the whole year, the overall contribution of the national tourism industry to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is 9.13 trillion ====, accounting for 11.04% of the total GDP. There are 28.25 million people directly employed in the tourism industry, 79.9 million directly and indirectly employed in the tourism industry, accounting for 10.28% of the total employed population in China. The tourism industry plays a crucial role in the national economy. It can stimulate the development of related industries (e.g. hospitality industry, transportation industry, etc.) through its development. This change is assumed to bring unprecedented time compression and inter-city mobility (Chen, 2012). In view of increasing tourism demand, it is urgent to investigate whether and how Chinese HSR influences tourist arrivals. The topic has been recently examined, mostly focusing on a single HSR corridor, such as Wuhan–Guangzhou HSR (Yan et al., 2014) or Beijing–Shanghai HSR (Wang et al., 2014). As China's HSR network has gradually covered more and more cities, the competition among tourism destinations has not been confined to a single line but to the network. Furthermore, tourism may be heavily affected by HSR configurations, due to high dependence on factors mobility. However, few studies have explored the impact of HSR configurations on tourism.====To enrich the literature, the paper uses the Chinese HSR network and 286 cities as samples. First, a DID model is used to explore the causal effect of HSR on tourism. Second, because of the different years of HSR deployment in each city, the paper further applies the multi-stage DID model to examine the tourist arrivals affected by the opening of HSR year by year. Third, taking HSR frequency, station location, station class into consideration, the paper explores differential effects of HSR configurations on tourism.====The paper contributes to the existing literature on the nexus between HSR program and the tourism industry in two major aspects.",Do high speed rail configurations matter to tourist arrivals?

Potential policy instruments to make carsharing coexist with public transport are discussed.","Carsharing is a short time automobile rental service where the users pay a fee proportional to the use of the vehicle (Shaheen & Cohen, 2013). The service operates mostly in urban areas and rental periods range from a few hours down to a few minutes ride. The mode has attracted interest as an alternative to private vehicle use, and also in areas where other modes are available (Millard-Ball, 2005). The need to decrease dependence on private and conventionally-fuelled vehicles for mobility, which are a primary source of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe (European Commission, 2016) suggests that this mode can potentially play a role in decarbonising the transport sector. The European Commission, in its strategy towards a low emission mobility, considers carsharing services to stand along with the actions that should be promoted by local authorities to reduce congestion and pollution (EC MEMO/16/2497).====Of particular interest is the analysis of how carsharing interacts with other modes, namely public transport and private vehicles, in the urban context. To contribute to lowering transport externalities, apart from substituting private vehicle use, this mode is expected to complement public transport and other mobility alternatives (Shaheen & Chan, 2016). The complementarity property refers to an increase in carsharing use being associated with an increase in public transport use. This implies that those who start using carsharing services should increase their use of public transport. However, as they are both urban travel modes, carsharing can instead substitute public transport use (Martin et al., 2011; Rotaris et al., 2019). Having people shifting away from public transport use towards carsharing instead of doing it from private vehicle use to carsharing, the carsharing's potential contribution to low carbon mobility is marked down.====The overall limited diffusion of carsharing makes it difficult to quantify its impacts on other modes' use. However, a deep understanding of carsharing users’ perceptions and preferences towards the mode as well as the elicitation of the comparative advantages and disadvantages with respect to public transport and private vehicle can highlight the aspects that can favour or limit the complementarity with public transport as well as its potential to substitute private vehicle use.====The aim of this paper is hence to contribute to the analysis of the complementarity and substitutability between carsharing services and public and private transport modes. Previous studies focusing on the relation between carsharing and other modes provide mainly quantitative-based evidence and are lacking a thoughtful explanation of the means behind mode substitution. A deeper understanding of the reasons why a mode is preferred to or complements other modes will contribute to highlighting the main drivers of the transport mode decision and providing guidance for low carbon mobility policies.====Qualitative analysis may give important insights into this aspect and enable us to consider the heterogeneity of users’ preferences. We use a series of in-depth interviews with carsharing users, capturing their experiences, opinions and preferences towards this mode and the relation with their use of public transport and private vehicles. To do so, we first gain deeper insights into the motivations for adopting and using carsharing; and then, we analyse how public transport and private vehicles are perceived and how their use has changed with carsharing use. We will then be able to discuss how policy measures can support diffusion of carsharing services and limit the risk of shifting away from public transport rather than shifting away from private vehicle use.====Moreover, this study is accompanied by a series of interviews with stakeholders from administration, business and associations related with carsharing and urban mobility that help picturing the current development of carsharing in Spain as well as highlighting the economic and policy aspects that might influence its diffusion and complementarity with other modes. In our analysis, we focus on the Spanish carsharing system as it offers a market with different carsharing operators in different cities.====The next section introduces the current status of carsharing in Spain. Section 3 reviews previous related works. Section 4 describes the methodology applied in this study. Section 5 presents the findings, which are discussed in section 6.

This paper aims to propose a formal test of the impact of the Ecopass in the long term by using a novel methodology which combines regression discontinuity with ====. Results confirm the poor performance of the policy within 90 days to one year (depending on the pollutant) after introduction.","Air pollution is a source of great concern for policy makers, especially in cities where traffic density can produce high concentrations of pollutants.====To reduce the externalities generated by transport, a growing number of cities have introduced road pricing measures, i.e. charging for the use of roads that fall in a given perimeter. As a result of international trials on the use of road pricing measures and given the criticality of the environmental situation, the City of Milan introduced the Ecopass in 2008, a road pricing scheme calibrated on the generation of pollution by vehicles entering the city centre. The scheme was implemented from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. during working days and was applied to all vehicles that passed through one of the gates equipped with cameras. By paying the charge, the owner of the vehicle obtained full access to the area for the entire day. Vehicles were divided into five categories based on their PM10 emission factors (COPERT IV model); the first two categories (alternative-fuel vehicles and new Euro-class vehicles) were exempted, whereas vehicles in the three other categories had to pay a charge of 2, 5 and 10 euros, respectively. Residents within the perimeter had the opportunity to subscribe to yearly passes at a price equivalent to 10% of full-year access.====In an earlier study, Percoco (2013), using the regression discontinuity design (RDD), found that the effect of the Ecopass on the concentration of pollutants disappeared only one week after its introduction. However, Percoco (2013) made his argument for the limited long-term impact of the Ecopass based only on an RDD on a sample excluding one week before and one week after the introduction of the policy. This test, although providing some insights, is incorrect by definition because it neglects the fundamental limitation of RDD, which is providing local estimates of the effect of the policy.====The aim of the present study is to corroborate the findings of Percoco (2013) by adopting an approach, proposed by Angrist and Rokkanen (2015), which allows the extrapolation of the policy effect estimated with a RDD approach far from the threshold, i.e. in our case, several months after the introduction of the Ecopass. The econometric analysis confirms a reduction in the concentration of various pollutants immediately after the introduction of the Ecopass and a substantial ineffectiveness after 90 days to one year.",A formal test of the long-term environmental effects of road pricing in Milan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301499,17 September 2020,2020,Research Article,158.0

Both DSRC and cellular-based systems use GPS data to price roads and toll users based on traffic conditions. DSRC employs roadside units (RSUs) to receive and send messages to in-vehicle DSRC units. A cellular-based system could use communications from cellular towers in combination with a smartphone, on-board diagnostics port (OBD-II), or pre-installed cellular chip. DSRC is a valuable technology to ==== congestion pricing at highly congested locations, such as bridges and major highways, while cellular communications enable congestion pricing across entire networks.====VMT fees can be relatively simple, or variable in space and time, facilitating transportation-agency cost recovery. A next step for roadway management is congestion pricing (CP), to better reflect the marginal delay costs of one's travel choices. When coupled with travel credits, CP can better ensure welfare gains for most travelers.","Traffic congestion is a major problem in all major urban areas, costing citizens valuable time. Congestion is caused by an excess of vehicles on part of a roadway at a given time, leading to vehicle speeds that are slower than the normal “free flow” speeds of that roadway (Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2017). Congestion costs the U.S. economy over $100 billion a year, and this number is rising over time (Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), 2014; Shrank, Eisele, Lomax, & Bak, 2015; Burfeind, 2017). This includes the direct costs of the value of fuel and time wasted as well as the indirect costs from the increased cost of doing business. As economies and populations continue to grow, congestion is expected to increase. In order to combat increasing gridlock, it is important to develop policies and implement technologies that reduce congestion.====Roadways are limited by their capacity, which is the maximum flow of traffic that can be handled by a given roadway section. Capacity flow values are affected by the number and width of lanes, median and merge area designs, intersection or interchange frequency, presence of stop signs or signal lights, curvature, grade, and other design variables (FHWA 2017). When demand for travel rises, congestion sets in, slowing travel speeds and lengthening travel times. Congestion can be recurring or non-recurring. Recurring congestion is the result of normal traffic volumes in a typical environment (Hallenbeck, Ishimaru, & Nee, 2003), such as peak times of day every weekday upstream of key bottlenecks (like bridge crossings) in urban environments. Non-recurring congestion is caused by unusual events or conditions that result in capacity losses or added demand. Vehicle collisions, construction zones, inclement weather, and special events (like professional football game days) can all result in non-recurring congestion by temporarily reducing capacity or exceeding existing corridor capacities. While transportation network capacities are inflexible due to the limitations of the existing infrastructure, travel demands fluctuate minute to minute and day to day. Since the size of roads and freeways cannot be varied to match demand, demand must be influenced to reduce congestion. Travel demand can be influenced randomly by special events, weather, and other factors, but it can be actively managed by implementing public policies.====Without regulation and pricing, the demand-supply equilibrium for roadway space settles at a suboptimal point, because users only consider the direct costs of congestion on their personal travel time (Komanoff, 2017). Users ignore the additional marginal cost of their travel on the transportation network, which adds to the travel time of all road users (Kockelman & Kalmanje, 2005).====Congestion pricing is one potential solution to this issue. Such pricing or road tolling involves incentivizing certain link and thus route choices for drivers, to improve the overall efficiency of a congested corridor's or congested network's roadways. By charging a higher price to travel on highly-congested roadway sections or offering tax credits for traveling through less-congested areas, system managers can encourage choices that decrease system-wide costs and improve social welfare or net community benefits. By confronting users with the true cost of their travel (reflecting the delays they impose on other travelers, behind them, essentially), congestion pricing pushes the supply-demand equilibrium point to the left, decreasing traffic volume. Lower volume means less congestion and lower travel times on that link. Without congestion pricing, drivers face only the directly experienced or average cost of travel, resulting in over-consumption of what truly is a socially more expensive good than they realize. With appropriate pricing in place, travel choices become less sub-optimal, and ideally reflect the full cost of added vehicles on each roadway segment, at each time of day.====Recent and emerging developments in communication and computation technology make widespread implementation of congestion pricing systems feasible and potentially highly cost-effective. This paper examines the technologies and policies that could be implemented in a congestion pricing system. With information gathered from various expert sources, this work provides recommendations for the best mix of technology and policy in several transport settings, as well as a roll-out strategy for congestion pricing.",Technologies for congestion pricing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300615,15 September 2020,2020,Research Article,159.0

To this end, a Ramsey ==== model is used, with focus on domestic flights. Marginal costs for different aircraft types, namely Fokker 100, Boeing MD83, and Airbus A320 are estimated. Next, these marginal costs are used to calculate the Ramsey fees for each aircraft type in Iran. The findings of this study indicate that an increase in the length of flight increases the Ramsey landing fees. Moreover, the calculated Ramsey landing fees for the flights with length of 800 km or less are lower than the current weight-based fees; while for the flights with length of 1200 km and more the Ramsey fees are higher than the current fees. The other finding is that the Ramsey fees for A320 is always lower than that of MD83 despite the fact that A320 has a higher maximum takeoff weight than the MD83.","Airport charges are among the factors that directly affect the financial performance of airports and airlines. Therefore, it is crucial to understand these impacts to adopt appropriate charging policies to improve the efficiencies and economic welfare. From the airlines' perspective, airport charges are an important issue since they directly affect their operating costs (Martı́n-Cejas, 1997; Solvoll and Mathisen, 2017). Doganis (2002) reports that, on average, the airport and en-route charges represent approximately 7% of total operating costs for ICAO member airlines. Even though these costs are not considered to be that high,==== airlines have to pay attention to the airport charges because of the competitive environment and falling yields (Graham, 2013). From the airports' viewpoint these charges are also important because they are an important source of revenue. In most countries airport infrastructure is financed by revenues received in return for providing services (Losada et al., 2012). In fact, a large portion of airports’ revenue is related to charges that cover the cost of services supplied by them (Mathisen et al., 2017, pp. 213–234).====At the same time, as a result of the compliance of most countries in the world with the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Associations (IATA) regarding the standardization of airport charges, the pricing structure of landing fees in most airports, including the airports in Iran, is based on the maximum takeoff weight of the aircrafts. However, this pricing structure may not cover all the costs of the airports, so weight-based charges will not be efficient and may lead to an inefficient use of capacity and a welfare loss (Martin-Cejas, 1997; Niemeier, 2009).==== Therefore, it is necessary to use another schemes for determining charges that can represent costs and lead to efficient outcomes.====According to the literature, marginal cost pricing might be an optimal pricing structure for airports, but as described above, in reality the airports' charges are weight based or close to their average costs (Carlsson, 2003; Hakimov and Mueller, 2014a, Hakimov and Mueller, 2014b, I). Marginal cost pricing (the first best solution) maximizes welfare, but will result in a loss if the marginal costs be below the average costs (Reynolds-Feighan & Feighan, 1997; Mankiw, 2008), which is very likely in the case of airports (Doganis, 2002). As an alternative, it is possible to use the Ramsey pricing approach, which determines second best charges and cover average total costs. This method allows cost recovery, without forgetting the principle of efficient allocation of the airport's available capacity (Button, 2010; Martin-Cejas, 1997; Martín-Cejas, 2015; Shepherd, 1992). It also helps to reduce the deficit incurred in the aeronautical operations of the airport, avoiding the need for subsidies (Oum & Tretheway, 1988; Martin-Cejas, 1997).====Ramsey prices, which are proportional to the inverse of the elasticity of demand, are optimal at uncongested airports.==== Because marginal costs are especially low at such uncongested airports (Forsyth, 2005) and are clearly below the average costs, marginal cost (MC) pricing would cause a financial loss, while Ramsey prices would lead to cost recovery. On the other hand, the Ramsey prices might not be efficient for congested airports, because the slot rivalry is not addressed in calculating the Ramsey prices, despite the fact that these airports are operating at their capacity (Forsyth & Niemeier, 2008; Hakimov and Mueller, 2014a, Hakimov and Mueller, 2014b, II). Niemeier (2009) claims that the weight-based system can be considered as an attempt to find a second best solution, because larger aircrafts have a relatively inelastic demand and pay more than the small ones. However, the current IATA pricing structure is a completely weight based approach (International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 2012) and does not include demand characteristics. Therefore it can be considered an imperfect Ramsey pricing structure at best (Niemeier, 2009; Hakimov and Mueller, 2014a, Hakimov and Mueller, 2014b, II).====It was because of these considerations that many scholars have examined the pricing schemes in different airports around the world. However, despite the importance of understanding the impact of airport pricing, there is no study related to pricing in the Iranian airports. Currently, the airports in Iran are mostly accumulating losses and deficits; therefore, Ramsey pricing may help the Iranian government to reduce losses incurred on airport operations. In addition, Iran may be a good case study to compare weight based charges and Ramsey pricing because the airports in the study have the same operator, are uncongested, and have relatively similar operating conditions. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by calculating Ramsey landing fees for a sample of five uncongested international airports in Iran with a very low level of competition, which consistently lose money. The objective of this paper is to estimate Ramsey-type landing fees for three types of aircrafts, namely Airbus A320, Boeing MD83, and Fokker 100, in five uncongested airports in Iran from the second quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2015.====The definition of revenues for the airports, used to cover the aviation infrastructure costs, is also worth noting, as it affects the airport charges. Airports around the world offer both aviation and non-aviation (concession) services and collect revenues from both services (Ivaldi et al, 2011; Ivaldi et al., 2015). In setting the airport charges, it is possible to consider the revenues from both services or only from the aeronautical activities. Single-till approach considers all revenues but dual-till approach==== considers the revenues from the aeronautical activities only (Ivaldi et al., 2015); therefore the charges would be lower in single-till approach compared to the dual-till. In Iran, only 5% of the airports' revenue comes from the non-aeronautical activities and also airports do not operate competitively. Due to the small share of non-aeronautical revenues, using dual-till or single-till approaches would not result in substantial differences in the results.====Currently, there are 59 operational airports in Iran, and 54 of them are owned and operated by the Iranian airport company. The rest are owned and operated by other organizations under the supervision of the Iranian airport company. Additionally, the airports owned by the Iranian airport company include nine international airports.==== Moreover, there are about 16 million square meters of passenger terminals, airports buildings, runways and maneuvering areas and also nine million square meters of access roads, green space, parking lots and other spaces related to these airports in Iran. In 2017, around 720 thousand landings have taken place at these airports and about 59.5 million passengers have passed through the Iranian airports. In the same year, the five airports sampled in this study represent 44% of the total landings and 55% of the total passenger flown in Iran.====All domestic and international airports are managed by the government and privatization has not been implemented to this industry yet. The pricing structure is such that the charges of airport services are determined by the government under the article 63 of the law, put in effect in 1994. Following article 63 and the standards of IATA and ICAO, the landing and takeoff service fees are calculated based on the maximum takeoff weight of the aircraft.====As for the number of the airlines and aircrafts in Iran, there were 23 active airlines in 2019 and none of these airlines can be considered as a low-cost airline.==== These airlines operated a fleet of 312 aircrafts with an average age of 22 years==== and almost half of these aircrafts belonged to the Iran Air, Mahan Air, and Iran Aseman airlines. The most frequently used airplanes are Airbus A320s, Boeing MDs, and Fokker, with a total of 44, 47, and 46 airplanes, respectively.====The findings of this paper show that the Ramsey landing fee increases with the increase in the length, so it is recommended that in determining the landing fees, the flight length should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the calculated Ramsey landing fees for flights with length of 800 km and less are lower than the current weight-based fees; while for the flights with length of 1200 km and more, the Ramsey fees are higher than the current fees. These findings can be used by policy makers of the public sector and the experts of Iran Airports & Air Navigation Company to adopt appropriate policies for the country's aviation market.====In the following, Section 2 presents the methodology and the literature review on Ramsey pricing and its application in determining the airport charges.

Using a ,"Since the economic changes began in 1970, China has experienced high commercial development. China has witnessed a fast growth of the transport network along with the rise in GDP. Over the past 20 years, China has spent heavily on government facilities (Harrington & Daniels, 2012). Such expenditure has given market access in the transportation sector, enabled national market incorporation, reduced manufacturing and logistics expenses, and enabled China to contend locally and internationally (Appleby, 2008). In addition to adding to development, this expenditure has contributed straight to poverty reduction by enhancing access to facilities and financial possibilities.====Targeted expenditure on infrastructure was also a component of domestic programs for poverty alleviation (Wang, 2013). Since the 1990s and notably since the 10th Five-Year Plan, with its proactive fiscal strategy to stimulate financial development and decrease inequality through stronger transportation investment in housing facilities by the Chinese government has risen significantly (Wu, 2013). There has been considerable advancement in increasing the amount and performance of rural roads. Nearly all regions in China can fit roads, which implies that roads are more available than other modes of travel, thus playing a significant part in regional economic advancement and poverty alleviation (Zheng, 2018).====In 1984, via the Food-for-Work initiative, the Chinese government started building dNTage, soil preservation initiatives, and district and city roads. This program provides the needed infrastructure for disadvantaged communities in impoverished regions and short-term employment (Zheng & Huang, 2018). Food, silk, and agricultural goods are provided at no price by the central government. These products are used to compensate for road employees in agrarian areas. To pay for materials and facilities, local authorities are needed to provide matching funds.====The government in China invested 920 million yuan annually in constructing residential roads in 529 less developed counties in 21 provinces during the 8-7 poverty reduction program that was meant to improve the lives of over 75 million Chinese living with poverty (Fan & Chan-Kang, 2005). Every year, 42,000 km of new national roads were constructed during the schedule era, and the performance of residential roads significantly enhanced. In 1998, the Chinese government chose to further boost facilities development, with district and municipal road networks being one of its goals (Fujiwara & Zhang, 2013). By the beginning of 2002, there were 1065 million kilometers of the district and municipal highways—244,000 km greater than in 1995.====In 2002, China started implementing a road-building program to access western counties. The proposed plan included 252 building plans in over 15 regions that will increase the number of highways to 26000, a significant component of the government's strategy to enhance travel and encourage economic growth in the West (Dimitriou, 2019). Total expenditure was expected to achieve 30 billion Yuan. Over half of this was spent by the federal government and over 14 billion spent by other institutions in the government. In 2003, a national inter-county and urban road improvement and construction initiative were introduced by the Chinese government (Banister & Berechman, 2003). The scheme launched more than 5300 initiatives in 2003, comprising 78,000 km of building for a scheduled 75 billion yuan investment. At a strategic expenditure of 109 billion, the Ministry of Building (MOC) extended the scheme to 15,500 initiatives comprising 162,000 km of building in October (Liu, 2013). This initiative was a significant indication that China would support the fast growth of rural roads in its attempts to eliminate poverty.====In the mid-1990s, the Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) program was introduced in chosen provinces with assistance from the World Bank (Hendrischke, 2013). RIPA relies on connecting small towns and townships that presently do not have fundamental all-time connections to current highway networks (Jönson & Tengström, 2006). In the situation of Henan Province, the quantitative analysis arising from an ex-post assessment of the RIPA parts revealed that distant villages that had previously participated in subsistence farming had produced significantly stronger strides in economic growth, social development, and poverty alleviation than similar communities in power fields.====In the RIPA impact zone, there has been rapid development of cars, traveller, and freight transport (Minami & Jiang, 2016). As the transportation system improved and peasants ' revenue increased, even more, peasant households bought engines and cars to conduct non-agricultural sectors or promote transport. Developing transport system has translated the prospective requirement for transport into actual supply and encouraged the growth of traveller and freight transport (Naughton, 2007). China remains a communist nation. Despite the values of free-market markets, China's laws governing a public company are distinct from the Chinese stock trading regulations on the Shanghai Börse and on the Hong Kong Stock Bourse. The infrastructure of transport is commonly intended to foster development. Many nations proceed to create significant savings in infrastructure, relying on the principle that citizens need entry if thoughts and economies are to profit. However, the causal effects of transport infrastructure investments are disputed. While others think that this should not be a political objective, it should instead be kept to create the infrastructure by the market forces when supply requires this. Unequivocal assessments of the scale and effect path could affect strategy.====This study examines the impact of transport networks in China to highlight this critical debate. The infrastructure was built ten years ago, China and colonial powers decided to create railways linking historic urban areas with each other and a newer Treaty port. China has established road and rail networks, such that access to some part of its transport network is not linked to the potentials of this country. If there is a region that connects one of the cities, it will be more likely to be next to a significant road today. The study focuses on historical data from 1990 to 2017 and it is divided into two methodological approaches: aggregate and regional, Machine Learning and econometric. Besides this Introduction, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature. Section 3 introduces and describes the data and the methodology employed. Section 4 shows the Machine Learning approach. Section 5 presents the results about ML model brings a discussion on the results.

It considers the passenger ferry fleet sizing taking into account the employment of the existing and subcontracted fleet. The proposed model can be used to optimally solve instances by using a commercial exact solver. To deal with hard examples, we used three matheuristic methods: Variable Neighborhood Branching (VNB), Variable Neighborhood Decomposition Search for 0-1 MIP (VNDS 0–1 MIP) and Variable Intensity Neighborhood Search (VINS). Our experimental results show that in most of the cases matheuristics produce solutions of equal or higher quality in less computational time compared to the commercial exact solver.","According to Adriatic Sea Tourism Report (Risposte Turismo, 2017), the ferry service is facing stable growth in the traffic volume encouraging operators to include new routes in liner operations. The expansion of ferry service is noticeable, especially in regions with the increased road congestion and consequently enhanced level of emission inventories (Commission of the European Communities, 2001; Lupi, Farina, Orsi, & Pratelli, 2017). On the other hand, ferry transport is considered as a very flexible and convenient mode of transferring people and goods between ports and connecting communities in remote and peripheral areas. Mostly, ferry services are developed due to the government's and local authority's needs to improve the quality of transportation processes. This quality depends on numerous factors such as frequency of service, travel time, speed, availability of routes, comfort, cost estimation, etc. Ferries are mostly used for transporting cars, trucks and passengers, and service can be specialized (transporting only people or cargo) or the multipurpose one. This study comprehends only the use of passenger ferries.====The situation in passenger ferry shipping in the last decade is characterized by the new design of ferries and the increased level of traffic volumes especially in European Union (EU) region. The statistical data show that 58% of the traffic is realized between the ports of the same country. Additionally, 60% of total ferry fleet is operating inside EU while 40% belongs to the rest of the world. Related to the number of passengers, 38% are transported in EU, while 62% represents the passenger throughput in the rest of the world (European Parliament, 2016).====In similar studies (performed by Baird, 1997; Jorgensen, Pedersen, & Solvoll, 2004; Jorgensen, Mathisen, & Larsen, 2011; Baird, 2012), the authors explained in detail the importance of passenger ferry transport to avoid the bottleneck in road transportation and the use of this service in the absence of alternative mode of transport. First, we focus on three EU regions: Baltic, North Sea and Mediterranean. Ferry fleet in Baltic and North Sea regions is characterized by fast, flexible and reliable ferries (Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration in Asia, 2014). The largest of all mentioned regions is Mediterranean where 55% of all ferry routes in EU is located due to high transportation demands. Within Mediterranean region, we distinguish domestic ferry services in Greece including 114 islands with the yearly throughput of 34 million of passengers (Baird & Wilmsmeier, 2011; Chlomoudis, Pallis, Papadimitriou, & Tzannatos, 2007). Significant portion of ferry routes belongs to Tirrenian Sea (where ferry routes are connecting Sardinia with the mainland) and Balearic Sea (with routes that are connecting Balearic Islands and mainland) (European Parliament, 2016).====Auckland's ferry development plan from 2014 (Auckland Transport, 2014) puts the emphasis on integrating ferry services of public transport with the possibility of incorporating new ferry routes in the region. In US and Canada, ferry services are playing very important role and mostly are integrated into urban transportation systems of cities: New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver. These services provide the reduction of travel time of commuters as they are directly linked to the destination areas (Federal Transit Administration, 2003).====The local ferry transport is attractive to overcome the absence of alternative infrastructure for local inhabitants to go to work as well as for tourists’ visits to important historical destinations such as Marseille, Gdansk, Lisbon, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Naples, Venice, etc. (European Parliament, 2016). In 2016, the Government of Croatia adopted the decision on determining state routes in public transport of liner coastal shipping with the definition of ferry, fast-ferry and shipping lines (Government of the Republic of Croatia, 2016). The statistics show that in 2017 the total traffic volume of passengers transported along these routes was more than 13 million (Agency for coastal liner shipping, 2017).====Our research relies on mentioned concepts when establishing liner passenger ferry service along pre-determined routes. The idea is to propose a foundation of a joint ferry operator that would dispose with the ferry fleet to cover different demands for transportations (of local inhabitants and tourists) while considering seasonal effects. The corresponding fleet would be composed of existing, purchased and chartered-in ferries (time charter) with the restrictions that the last two types of ferries serve only for touristic purposes. In addition, a relationship between demand and supply in terms of purchasing or chartering-in (hiring) additional ferries is measured by the number of non-used seats and by the lay-up time of ferries. This enables also to optimize the ferry fleet size during the considered planning horizon. In order to combine all the specified challenges, we created a comprehensive general Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that forces the employment of existing ferries along given routes with deterministic transport demands. The objective is to maximize the profit of a ferry operator. This profit is based on the estimated revenue, operating and voyage costs of all ferries from the considered fleet. The model can be applicable at local and regional level (upon some adjustments), for example, in the Adriatic Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, Marmara Sea and similar regions with the intensive traffic volumes of passenger maritime services. The developed model is primarily used within CPLEX 12.6 commercial exact solver (CPLEX, 2015) and then hybrid heuristic methods (matheuristics): Variable Neighborhood Branching (VNB) proposed by Hansen, Mladenović, and Urošević (2006), Variable Neighborhood Decomposition Search for 0–1 MIP (VNDS 0–1 MIP) developed by Lazić, Hanafi, Mladenović, and Urošević (2010) and Variable Intensity Neighborhood Search (VINS) from Jovanović, Davidović, Lazić, and MitrovićMinić (2015) were applied. Those and similar methods have not been intensively applied to passenger ferry service problems and we showed that they may be useful, especially for hard test instances.====Based on the reported literature review, there are three contributions of the paper. The first one is the definition of transport policy to optimize the deterministic demands for passenger ferry transportation of local inhabitants and tourists with respect to maximization of ferry operator's profit. We formalize this policy by the development of the corresponding MILP model. The model enables optimal sizing of fleet composed of available ferries and their allocation along routes. The second contribution examines the possibility to include the new (purchased and chartered-in) ferries for touristic purposes depending on the profitability aspect of the investment made by ferry operator. In that way we additionally contribute to the research topic related to the optimal sizing of the ferry fleet. Our model also shows the level of missed opportunity of a ferry operator to seize larger profit in the ferry fleet allocation because it stipulates lay-up time of ferries and penalty costs produced on routes. This impacts to the optimal relationship between demand for transportation and offered ferries' capacities. The model is validated on the real data in most of the cases providing optimal engagement of existing fleet as well as suggesting the level of exploiting purchased and chartered-in ferries. The final contribution of the paper is related to improving decisions of the ferry operator regarding the optimal (or at least near optimal) allocation of ferries on routes in the considered time periods by taking into account the results obtained from commercial CPLEX exact solver and matheuristic methods, especially in the case of hard test instances.====The paper is organized as follows. Literature review is given in Section 2 with the emphasis on the similar studies involving enhancement of ferry operators’ profit, the use of operational research methods, investigation of liner shipping services, different aspects of ferry transport application, etc. Section 3 describes the problem formulation and the proposed model for the considered optimization problem defined as the mixed integer linear program. To address the hard test instances of the problem we propose the application of three heuristic methods described in Section 4. Numerical experiments are given in Section 5, while Section 6 provides results related to hard case study example.

We exploit micro-data on the entire universe of road accidents in Italy in the period before and after the VHL. We find no systematic variation of the number of deaths per accident, after controlling for an array of driver and vehicle characteristics, road and weather conditions, province-level effects and time effects absorbing country-level variation in traffic volumes and enforcement devices. We argue that the short-run marginal deterrent effect of the Italian VHL was negligible. We also document a number of correlations between several driver, vehicle and road characteristics and both the occurrence and the severity of fatal accidents. Our results may help improving policy initiatives aimed at curbing dangerous driving on Italian roads.","Road safety has an important impact on health and development. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) indicates that the worldwide total number of road traffic deaths is about 1.35 million per year, with road accidents being a leading cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29 years. WHO (2018) also estimates that road accidents cost to governments approximately 3% of GDP on average. To cope with this, in the last decade, several countries have improved road safety legislations, by aligned at least one of their laws with best practices on drunk driving, speed, negligence and other aggravating circumstances.====In 2016, Italy has introduced a new law (Law 41/2016) called “Vehicular Homicide Law” (VHL hereafter), aimed at curbing dangerous driving on Italian roads and at reducing death outcomes of road accidents, according to the EU benchmark of a 50% reduction in the number of deaths to be achieved in 2020 with respect to 2010 levels. With the VHL, a new type of unintentional vehicular manslaughter (referred to as “vehicular homicide”) has been created under Italian legislation, identifying dangerous driving (including driving whilst under the influence of drugs or alcohol) causing death. Under previous Italian legislation, escalating penalties were associated to the type of the injury caused by the road accident, with the maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment being for dangerous driving causing multiple death. Against this background, Italian VHL increased the penalties associated with all the possible levels of harm caused by dangerous driving, ranging from a minimum of 3 months imprisonment for non-serious injuries to a maximum of 18 years imprisonment for “vehicular homicide”.====The underlying rationale of Italian VHL reflects the traditional Beckerian principle (Becker, 1968) according to which the expected cost of committing a crime is a function of the offender's probability of apprehension and the severity of the sanction that he or she will face in case of apprehension. If individuals are rational agents, they will commit an illegal act if and only if the expected utility from doing so, taking into account the gain from the act and the probability of being caught and sanctioned, exceeds the utility from behaving legally. According to this very simple framework, Italian VHL, by shifting upward the scale of sanctions, all else being equal, was expected to improve general deterrence, thereby reducing the number of accidents, including those causing death.====Economic literature on deterrence shows that the deterrent effect of increasing punishments crucially depends on time discounting (e.g., Polinsky and Shavell (1999); Mastrobuoni and Rivers (2016)). If the discount rate is constant, stepping up punishments against all the levels of the activity leaves the relative incentives of committing different law infringements (say, different levels of negligent or dangerous driving) unchanged. This depends on the so-called “marginal deterrence” principle (Crinò, Immordino, Karakoç-Palminteri, & Piccolo, 2017; Friedman & Sjostrom, 1993; Mookherjee & Png, 1994): undeterred individuals will keep a reason to commit less, rather than more, harmful acts, if the discounted cost of the penalty they face rises with the harm. When individuals show hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic discounting functions instead (this reflecting into declining discount rates), then the deterrent effect against more harmful activities (i.e. those with longer baseline sentences), as induced by shifting upward the scale of punishments severity, tends to be reduced, since the extra threat of the most severe sanctions becomes weaker. In this case, stepping up the entire penalty scale may induce a switch to more harmful acts. This problem may be further amplified when the rise of penalties is made with respect to an existing scheme of punishments already relatively severe.====In this paper, we investigate empirically the short-run effect of Italian VHL on marginal deterrence, by measuring the intensive margin of the VHL introduced in Italy in 2016, i.e. its impact on the death-to-accident rate. We do so, by exploiting micro-data on the entire universe of road accidents in Italy in the period around the reform timing (about 530,000 observations, provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT)). We implement an estimation strategy based on a hurdle model, to take into account the zero-inflated structure of the data, and find that the intensive margin of Italian VHL (to be interpreted as the marginal deterrent effect of the Law) has been modest at best. Specifically, our model fails to detect a statistically significant reduction of death outcomes conditional on an accident having at least one injured person involved in the 9 months after the VHL was introduced, after controlling for an array of driver and vehicle characteristics, road and weather conditions, province-level effects and time effects absorbing country-level variation in traffic volumes (as due, for instance, to fluctuating economic conditions) and enforcement devices.====While this paper, on the one hand, is the first study on the deterrent effect of Italian VHL, thereby contributing to the optimal design of road safety regulation in Italy as well as in other countries (previous literature on the economics of road safety regulation includes, among others, Peltzman (1975), and Levitt and Porter (2001a, 2001b), and, on Italy, Benedettini and Nicita (2012)), on the other hand, it also adds on the quantitative literature on the deterrent effects of increasing punishment severity (see, generally, Chen and Shapiro (2007), Drago, Galbiati, and Vertova (2011) and Hansen (2015)).====The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.

Comparison of GPS data collected in the first and second weeks showed, for those who received a personalized travel plan, an 8.1% shift towards more sustainable transport modes.","It is well documented that the intensive use of the car has negative effects on mental and physical health (noise and air pollution, commuting stress due to road congestion, traffic mortality, social exclusion, sedentary life). For example, in 2018 in Italy, where the number of cars saw an increase of 4.1% over 2014, air quality deteriorated, with levels of PM==== and PM==== far higher than standards set by both the European Union and the World Health Organization (I.S.F.O.R.T., 2018).====Hence, to address these issues a growing number of initiatives have been deployed for promoting travel behavior change toward more sustainable forms of transport. Travel Demand Management (TDM) strategies, often referred to as Mobility Management (MM) (Litman, 2003), are crucial activities adopted by public administrations, companies or universities, for encouraging employees or students to switch to sustainable transport modes in daily commutes. The strategic role of TDM policies is widely stated in the international literature in reducing car usage and promoting the environmental and social sustainability of commuting (Brog et al., 2009; Taniguchi et al., 2007). The purpose of TDM strategies targeting employees and students, is to reduce the negative impacts of private car use, such as air pollution and traffic congestion (Bamberg et al., 2011).====TDM measures that aim to change the external context in which choices are made are called ==== measures. Examples include improving public transport service levels, construction of new bike and pedestrian facilities, road pricing, parking management. Nevertheless, hard measures do not always produce the desired results as they do not succeed in making car use less appealing or triggering behavior change (Piras et al., 2018). Hence, paralleling tendencies in governance and policy-making have recently focused their attention on ‘soft’ policy measures and smarter choices. ==== measures, also named Voluntary Travel Behavior Change (VTBC) programs, aim to change, through communication and information, individuals' perceptions, motivations, knowledge and norms (Steg & Vlek, 2009), so as to steer them towards a more pro-environmental behavior (Piras et al., 2018). One kind of soft measure is Personalized Travel Planning (PTP), where individuals are provided with personalized information, to make them aware of available sustainable means of transport and encourage their use. Numerous PTP programs have been implemented over the last 20 years adopting different methodological approaches (==== IndiMark and Travelsmart (Brög et al., 2009), Travel Blending (James & Brög, 2002), Travel Feedback Programs (Fuji & Taniguchi, 2006), Personalized Travel Planning (Cairns et al., 2008). Originally TDM strategies only focused on employees, but recently mobility managers from different universities worldwide have started to adopt policies specifically targeting students. In fact, university campuses are special and major destinations in cities, able to generate a significant number of trips, because of their role as centers of employment, teaching, research and dissemination (Rotaris & Danielis, 2014).====So, because travel between home and campus is the main reason for daily trips made by university students (Vale et al., 2018), the key to reducing environmental impacts and improving students’ health and quality of life could lie in the promotion of sustainable commute modes. To improve the effectiveness of these TDM measures, in this work we propose an innovative approach to travel demand management, based on a smartphone application. The novelty in the measure implemented is the integration of all mobility management activities into one smartphone application called IPET (Sanjust di Teulada & Meloni, 2016). We tested the app on a sample of students from the engineering faculty at the University of RomaTre (Italy). Students were invited to install the application on their smartphone to dynamically and automatically track their daily travel patterns, enabling mobility tutors (mobility management staff or transport researchers) to prepare and upload the PTP in which more sustainable alternatives were suggested. Through a gamification process, students were encouraged to keep the track activity on, enabling mobility tutors to check their mode choices. This approach has multiple benefits for university mobility management activities: i) it enables collection of travel behavior data for guiding urban planning choices; ii) it is a smart and reliable way for promoting new policies or transport solutions; iii) it allows mobility managers to reward the most sustainable students with bonuses or prizes.====The second contribution of the paper concerns the study of which cognitive factors intervene in the process of behavior change. To date, few studies have investigated the evolution of cognitive factors following the implementation of an informative measure. For example, a change of awareness in car-related problems may contribute to a change in travel behavior. Furthermore, informative measures could impact attitudes and intentions toward the use of more sustainable means of transport. Hence, exploring this phenomenon will provide essential information for the design of successful strategies to reduce the use of private motorized vehicles. In our specific case, we asked a set of questions applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as described in Ajzen (1991) to measure the psycho-attitudinal aspects before and after individuals had used the IPET application.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses relevant earlier research studies regarding the implementation of TDM strategies at universities and positions the current study.

Using spatial econometric techniques to analyze highway, air transport and railway infrastructure investments, this study finds that the employment effects of these investments vary widely across MSAs. Highway infrastructure is found to have positive, significant total effects on employment in most MSAs. Railway infrastructure investment has positive employment effects in MSAs with robust rail systems and high ridership. Air transport infrastructure investment results are mixed across MSAs and specification, but consistently provide small positive employment effects to landlocked Midwestern MSAs. Overall, highway infrastructure investment is found to provide the largest total effects on employment, but caution should be taken to account for ==== and other societal externalities related to transportation.","Transportation connects geographically separated populations and improves economic conditions across the globe. Economic activities related to businesses and individuals hinges on the availability of the region's transportation infrastructure. Additionally, a robust transportation infrastructure is an important component in improving economic conditions for a population. In the U.S., transportation infrastructure is provided by public investment at the federal, state, and local levels. This public investment in transportation infrastructure can lead to increased accessibility to these economic benefits as well as an improved flow of commerce. Infrastructure investment has been championed as a mechanism for employment growth and viewed as a policy tool to correct for a nation's job gap (Kochan, 2013). From the New Deal public works projects in the 1930s to the more recent American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, public spending on transportation infrastructure is a prominent tool for economic and employment recovery.====Notwithstanding the benefits of public infrastructure projects, the scarce funds of public tax coffers and numerous possible projects makes infrastructure investment decisions both complicated and impactful. The opportunity costs related to transportation infrastructure investment are also a concern. As the government taxes the public to fund these projects, consumers and businesses will alter their individual decision-making which creates distortions in the economy. Therefore, care must be taken to properly chose the appropriate allocation of public funds for these infrastructure investments. One major focal point of these investment decisions are employment effects. Investments that achieve increased levels of employment are viewed as politically and socially sound investments. These infrastructure investment projects achieve positive economic returns and provide multiplier effects on employment unlike other public investment options (Tyson, 2011). Transportation infrastructure projects such as highway, airport, and railway are at the core of many public infrastructure investments.====The economic impacts of these main transportation infrastructure projects have been a topic of research and discussion at an individual project level. Many of these discussions and studies focus on the effects of these investments on output in the economy. The employment effects from these transportation infrastructure projects is also a much discussed, but under researched area. Most agree that transportation infrastructure can be used as a policy instrument to increase regional growth in isolated areas. Employment and connectivity are intimately related as spatial isolation from economic opportunity can have negative impacts on employment in those isolated areas. Transportation infrastructure has the ability to improve the accessibility to these opportunities. Unfortunately, no such consensus exists surrounding the effects of transportation infrastructure investments and employment. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the employment effects of these major infrastructure investments is needed. This study provides that analysis and appears to be the first to estimate the employment effects from all three infrastructure investments in the U.S. The results of this study can assist in the difficult decision of the allocation of scarce public funds that policymakers face. Additionally, it serves as a starting point for future scholars to develop a societal level cost-benefit analysis of these investments.====The organization of the remainder of this study is as follows. Section 2 discusses the background concerning transportation infrastructure investment and the related scholarly research. Section 3 describes the data and methodology used to estimate the impact of these transportation infrastructure investments on employment. Section 4 provides the estimation results of the main model and checks for robustness.

Over the past decades, an increasing number of scholars have started to regard participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA) as an approach capable of producing more comprehensive, transparent and democratic assessments than traditional appraisal techniques. However, whereas a number of participatory MCA methods have been devised, the large majority of them seem to have enjoyed limited practical application and there are very few studies examining their effectiveness. In order to assess the presumed benefits and the potential drawbacks of such methods, this paper considers the case of the London Gateway Port and compares the actual planning and decision-making process of this port development programme with the results of a multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercise, involving several project stakeholders and experts. As a result of this analysis, the paper contends that the contribution that participatory MCA procedures can potentially provide to the improvement of decision-making for large-scale transport infrastructure seems limited at best.","At present major transport projects such as highways, high-speed railway lines, international airports and major container ports dominate development agenda worldwide. Projections concerning future investments are often hyperbolic. According to the estimates of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2011), the global demand for transport projects could amount to over $8 trillion between 2010 and 2030. In the UK, in particular, the government has committed to spend more than £60 billion ($76 billion) on transport infrastructure over the period 2015–2021. This will come alongside considerable investments by the private sector operators of the UK ports and airports (DfT, 2017).====However, decisions on large-scale transport projects are particularly contentious. Indeed, large-scale transport investments frequently imply multiple economic, environmental, social and political impacts, which go far beyond the physical assets that are being delivered (Dimitriou, Ward, & Wright, 2011). Moreover, these impacts and consequences are not always positive and often results in uneven distributions of the gains and losses over space and time, and hence amongst population groups (Dean, 2018). Unsuccessful mega project developments, unable to meet the original expectations and entailing cost overruns, construction delays and various technical problems, benefit shortfalls and severe social, health and environmental consequences have been extensively documented in the international literature (see, amongst others, Hall, 1980; Morris & Hough, 1987; Flyvbjerg, Bruzelius, & Rothengatter, 2003; Samset, 2012).====It is frequently contended (Dimitriou, 2009; Dimitriou et al., 2011 and, 2016, 2010; Schutte, 2010; Barfod, 2012; Jensen, 2012; Leleur, 2012; Macharis & Nijkamp, 2013) that one of the main causes for these poor performances can be attributed to rather inadequate ==== appraisal methodologies, negatively contributing to channel decisions into narrow frames of thought. In this regard, a number of scholars have expressed concern about the excessive importance given to economic-centric tools such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (Dimitriou, Ward, & Wright, 2010 and 2016; Barfod & Salling, 2015; Barfod, 2018; Cornet, Barradale, Barfod, & Hickman, 2018a; Hickman & Dean, 2018; Salling, Barfod, Pryn, & Leleur, 2018; Hickman, 2019) and the exclusion of many project stakeholders and local community groups from the decision-making process (Cornet, Barradale, Gudmundsson, & Barfod, 2018b; Dimitriou et al., 2011; Macharis & Baudry, 2018; Macharis & Bernardini, 2015; Macharis, Turcksin, & Lebeau, 2012; Ward, Dimitriou & Dean, 2016a). In their papers, many of these authors have emphasized the need for employing participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA) methods in the effort to produce more comprehensive assessments of project proposals, increase the participatory character of evaluations and improve the transparency of the appraisal and decision-making process. Over the past few decades, such methods have thus experienced a dynamic evolution, with new variants being devised and proposed at a face pace. A recent review of the relevant literature undertaken by Macharis and Bernardini (2015) indicates that, between 1985 and 2012, almost 300 journal articles focusing on the use of MCA and participatory MCA in transport appraisal have been published.====However, whereas the presumed benefits of participatory MCA methods, in terms of comprehensiveness of the analysis, transparency and democracy of the process, are widely espoused by their proponents, issues and problems potentially hampering their applicability and effectiveness do not seem to have been examined systematically (Dean, Hickman, & Chen, 2019). It is also not clear whether many of the proposed participatory MCA methods have enjoyed real-world applications or constitute mere academic proposals (Annema, Mouter & Razaei, 2015). Furthermore, when the methods have been really applied to ‘live’ practice, both the manner and the extent to which the results of the multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercises have been used to arrive at the final decision are not always distinctly explained by their proponents (Dean, 2018).====In order to assess the presumed benefits of such methods and examine in detail their possible drawbacks, this paper considers the case of the London Gateway Port, namely a new port complex, consisting of a container terminal, a logistics park and a port rail terminal, which is currently under construction at the edge of the Thames Estuary. Differently from several other large-scale transport projects which are being developed in the London Region, so far the London Gateway Port has remained largely unexplored by academics and has not been covered extensively by the media. The paper compares the actual planning and decision-making process of this port development programme, with the results of a multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercise, involving several project stakeholders and experts and undertaken according to the recommendations made by proponents of participatory MCA methods.====The rest of this paper consists of seven sections. Section 2 offers a description of the London Gateway Port and its planning and decision-making process. This section draws on several sources, including journal articles, online newspapers and reports, and interviews with experts and project stakeholders. Section 3 provides a brief overview of MCA and participatory MCA techniques, whilst Section 4 illustrates the key features of the specific approach to participatory MCA which was adopted in the case study. Section 5 concerns the specific application of this method to London Gateway Port. The results of the multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercise are presented in Section 6. Section 7 critically discusses these outcomes. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings and key lessons learned from this exercise.","Participatory multi-criteria analysis methods: Comprehensive, inclusive, transparent and user-friendly?

One objective is maximizing the overall investment return in road and hub construction and the users' satisfaction is translated by minimization of the overall usage cost. The problem is formulated in a way that can cover three possible policies as: Governmental requirement, constructor's break-even point and predefined make span. To make these models more ====, variable discount factors are used in preference to fixed ones. Accordingly, a comprehensive discussion about discount factors and their components has been included to justify the use of variable discount factors. Then some meta-heuristic algorithms like the Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and an enhanced variation of a well-known multi-objective genetic algorithm called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are developed and applied to solve the problem. The performance of algorithms is compared to each other by utilizing some indicators such as hypervolume, ε-indicator, spacing metric, and CPU time. Computational experiments emphasize the need for using stated assumptions and the variable discount factor. It also confirms the efficiency of the proposed ICA.","In the last two decades, the use of the hub transportation systems has aroused. These systems are able to facilitate the flow of entities by offering the possibility of efficient capacity sharing and fleet management and can be utilized to transfer entities in the telecommunication, transportation, and logistics systems (Gelareh & Nickel, 2011). Hub location problems (HLPs) are defined as a network in which there are ==== interacting points called spokes (non-hub nodes) and ==== centers of transportation named hubs (Damgacioglu H., Dinler, Ozdemirel, & Iyigun, 2014) and each pair of origin/destination are linked through at least one hub facility. One of the main characteristics of hub systems is that, by gathering the flows, they enable economies of scale to result in lower transportation costs (Klincewicz, 2002). The p-hub median problem can be defined as follows: given a set of nodes with pairwise traffic demands, choose p nodes to locate hubs and route the traffic of all nodes through these hubs at minimum cost. It is often assumed that hubs are connected by a complete network, the routing cost between hubs is discounted at a factor ====, and no direct connection exists between two none hub nodes (Yaman, 2011).====Despite some previous researches e.g. (O'Kelly, Morton, & Harvey, 1994) and (Kimms, 2005), the impossibility of direct linking between each pair of origin/destination (Martí, Corberán, & Peiró, 2015) is one of the classic assumptions and simplifications of HLPs which almost true in telecommunication systems but not in transportation systems, because in real-world cases, there are already several direct links between some pairs of nods and customers are able to use them instead of an indirect system, especially in air transportation, direct shipment is usually one of the options. Therefore, in this study the available direct routes and also any other existing systems are accessible for users and may reduce the share and the profits of the proposed hub system. Most studies in the literature attempted to model a hub network as the only available transportation system. However, in real-world cases, there are already some other transportation systems and competitive environments usually overcast establishing a new hub location system (LuerVillagra & Marianov, 2013; Sasaki, Campbell, Krishnamoorthy, & Ernst, 2014). For all we know, nearly all previous studies considered minimizing all costs as the one objective without considering any differences between costs of the system and its earned benefits, even though the origin of costs and gained benefits are not the same. Note that in reality, the system that reduces users' costs more than the others isn't the one that is grounded. Because almost all transportation systems are established by constructors (mainly governments), not by its users, and these institutions don't establish the system simply to reduce users' costs.====In constructors' sight, an appealing system is a profitable system that at least can compensate for their expenses. Therefore, studying and treating all types of costs, in the same way, isn't an apt way to approach and model these cases. For instance, suppose that by establishing a hub system, public cost (customers' cost) is reduced by X and this system costs Y for constructors, so if we study X and Y, in the same way, the objective function should be minimizing Y-X. In reality, however, up until constructors are not justified about how Y should be compensated, they don't invest in the system.====Furthermore, in reality, there is not just one option for users. They don't necessarily have to use the system that constructors have established. All users have the choice to utilize the cheapest and most cost-effective shipping plan after checking almost all available options. As a tangible example in postal systems, and for close distances users tend to send their cargo directly using intercity delivery options (Uber for example), instead of a public posting system, because it is cheaper, faster and needs less paperwork. In this atmosphere, it is clear for constructors that they will be unable to gain all the shipping shares. However, in most of the previous research, it is assumed that all shipping between all origin-destination pairs should be fulfilled by the proposed system. According to these facts and their preferred time window for the return of investments, constructors make a system that maximizes their revenue (and not necessarily a system that minimizes users' costs); they are also aware that the more users use the system the more revenue they get. Therefore, the problem is to find the best and attractive system for constructors and beneficial for users simultaneously.====Another flaw in previous studies is the lack of comprehensive study about discount factors that play a very important role in constructors and users' decision making. However, they are considered to be fixed (for example, 10–50%) or at the best, they are considered to be dependent on distance or amount of the shipload. In other terms the more distance and/or cargo the more discount, but it is not always the case. For example, for valuable assets like gold, fragile products, military equipment, nuclear waste, etc. these discount factors are negatively affected by distance and amount of cargo. Note that some materials like nuclear wastes and military equipment, don't even have the potential to be stored and shipped massively together. Some other types of goods require insurance due to their characteristics and associated charges also increase the cost of the proposed system. To cover the mentioned gaps in the literature and tackle these issues, a comprehensive discussion about discount factors is presented, in later sections.====In summary, in this research instead of using total cost as the only objective function, we separate costs and benefits by their payers and beneficiaries. Because, constructors want to maximize their own profit not the users' costs and if a system is not interesting enough for them they simply don't establish it at all. In contrast the users have no obligations to use the established system and they use a system that minimizes their costs. The problem is formulated in a way that can cover three possible policies with some minor changes: 1) constructors (generally governments) want to establish a system to facilitate the public transportation even if the system is not economically feasible for them. In that case, earning financial benefits is not a high priority, 2) constructors intended to participate in an economically sustainable project and achieve the break-even point within the very first period, and 3) constructors want to participate in an economically feasible project and gain break-even point within a predefined makespan. In any of them, constructors are fully aware that in a competitive environment they can't take over and cover all the customers' shipping, therefore they try to maximize their own profit and make the system more attractive for users by reducing their costs. Therefore, a mathematical model that considers both the viewpoints of users and constructors is formulated that focuses on establishing a hub network wherein customers can choose whether to use it or not and also covers constructors' benefits. Then some meta-heuristic methods are proposed to solve the models and examine their effectiveness. Furthermore, the different aspects of discount factors and their root causes such as fuel consumption, maintaining, and repair costs, assurance and holding costs, taxes and tolls, etc. are discussed.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section a bi-objective mathematical model concerning mentioned policies is presented (an illustrative example is presented to describe the model in practice see APPENDIX B). Then different aspects of discount factors are discussed section 3. A new hybrid solution method based on the imperialist competitive algorithm is introduced to solve the model in section 4.

During this period of about half a century the Italian railways network was built and essentially completed.====Our study is motivated by two main reasons. On the one hand, history represents one of the main factors conditioning transport systems, and the analysis of the early evolution of railways can provide a better understanding of present infrastructures (Bogart, 2013; Ciccarelli et al. 2020). Fundamental ingredients of today railway system are a legacy of the past. About 70% of the railway lines operating today in Europe already existed in 1900 (Martí-Henneberg, 2013). In the Italian case, the lines of the nineteenth century were often constructed under a perverse incentive structure, with public subsidies awarded per kilometres actually built rather than straight line distance. This induced the construction of tortuous lines with an insufficient number of bridges and tunnels with respect to actual needs, and “today's commuters are still paying for that error” (Fenoaltea, 2011).==== The stratification of choices and (possibly misplaced) policies of the past contributes thus to determine current features of infrastructural systems.====Jedwab and Moradi (2016) analyse the case of early railway development in Ghana and most of the rest of Africa. Using a database from 1891 to 2000 on railroads and cities, the paper demonstrates that the first development of railways in poor countries can have long lasting effects on the level and geographical distribution of economic activity.==== Like many developing countries today, nineteenth century Italy was a backward and agriculture-based economy, characterized by extremely low literacy rates, and a sizeable regional divide. Soon after the political unification of the country in 1861, the building of a national railway system ranked high among Italian policy-makers’ priorities, for both political (nation-building) and economic reasons. Effectively, the bulk of the railway network was already completed in the 1880s, about 25 years after Italy's political unification. The same decades registered the birth and gradual diffusion of a proper manufacturing industry, characterized by the mechanization of production processes and the birth of industrial plants of a certain size. The Ansaldo company, producing steam locomotives and rolling stock but also involved in shipbuilding and more generally mechanical works, was founded in Genoa in the 1850s. Pirelli, producing rubber in Milan, was founded in the early 1870s.==== Breda, founded in Milan in the mid-1880s, produced steam locomotives and, later, armaments and aircrafts.==== FIAT, producing cars, was founded in Turin in 1899, and represents, even today, by far the largest car manufacturer in Italy. The list is not exhaustive, and one cannot exaggerate the international role of the Italian “big business”. However, it should suffice to convey the message of the modernization process, and related gradual replacement of artisanal with factory-based industry, experienced by the country in the fifty years following its political unification. After all, the beginning of the twentieth century represented in Italy, as elsewhere in the Western World, a period of generalized prosperity (the so called ====) stimulated by rising international trade and capital flows, the diffusion of new technologies (just to mention the replacement of steam with electricity), and a considerable reduction in transport costs (Broadberry & O'Rourke, 2010).====The second motivation behind this paper is that Italy is characterized by considerable socioeconomic/regional heterogeneity, typified by a long-lasting North-South divide, calling naturally for a regional disaggregated analysis (A'Hearn & Venables, 2013; Ciccarelli & Fachin, 2017; Basile & Ciccarelli, 2018; Felice, 2019). Indeed, given the rich set of historical statistical reconstructions available, Italy represents one of the few countries that allow researchers to perform an empirical analysis of the regional impact of early railway investments on industrial developments based on annual longitudinal data. The analysis, we believe, is of particular interest. Indeed, when the infrastructural stock is relatively small with respect to investment flows, the ensuing industrial development effects should be, at least in principle, easier to identify.====The paper uses annual regional data on railways extension and value added at 1911 prices in manufacturing, and aims at contributing to the development of a “database of case studies and models to allow general conclusions to be drawn from the local to the macro-level” (Banister & Berechman, 2001). The empirical analysis is based on standard dynamic models for macro panel data: the Pesaran and Smith (1995) Mean Group (MG) estimator, the Pesaran (2006) Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) estimator, and the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator introduced by Eberhardt and Teal (2010, p. 515). Our results suggest that, when evaluated at the national level, the contribution of early railway developments on industrial growth was relatively modest, albeit increasing over time. The effect was instead sizeable, both in terms of direct and spillover effects, for northern regions.====The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature.

We add to the literature by assessing the impact of CT on the operational costs of car ferry services in the case of Norway. Note the similarity with public transport: car ferries transport vehicles from one road point to another, like public transport does with passengers. Furthermore, we study the impact of CT on market concentration. The data comprises 53 ferry links across 8 years, yielding 424 observations. The results reveal that: (i) implementation of CT significantly lowered operational costs; and (ii) market concentration increased. These findings suggest that CT might not lead to free competition in the long run but rather to monopolistic/duopolistic tendencies, contrary to its intentions. We urge policymakers to reconsider CT carefully because its results could be counter to intentions.","Over the last three to four decades, governments worldwide have been concerned with the way in which public resources, including the transportation sector, are used. The result of this concern has been that the transportation sector has been a subject of reforms to promote efficiency and/or to reduce costs in the provision of public services; see, for instance, Hensher and Stanley (2010). Such reforms have included the privatization of government-owned transportation enterprises and/or the subjection of the delivery of public transportation services to competition. The latter type of reform is called competitive tendering (CT). It has been most promoted in the provision of public transportation services, with the major objective being the containment of costs to governments; see, for instance, Hensher and Wallis (2005). In the transportation sector in general, CT implies that a contract to operate or provide a transportation service is subjected to competition, in which the bidder with the lowest cost, albeit the bidder offering the most attractive cost/quality combination, is awarded the contract to operate for a period of time, after which the operation is again subjected to competition. CT is a contrast to the traditional way of providing public transportation services, which has been that one incumbent is awarded a contract year after year based on negotiations using some standard cost norms as the base negotiation and that the services to be delivered are pre-specified by the authorities. Typically, as in the Norwegian case for car ferry transport, for example, it means that the incumbents were reimbursed the difference between the actual operational costs and their ticket earnings, whereas the transportation authorities determined the ticket earnings, which were not sufficient to cover the operational costs.====The attractiveness of CT over the traditional ways of providing transportation services is appealing from an economics (or a cost saving) point of view for two particular reasons, both of which have been advocated by economists and transportation planners for a long time; see, for instance, Savas (2000) and Hensher and Wallis (2005). The first reason is that competitors for tenders will most likely strive to deliver the most efficient or the least costly way of providing the pre-specified services because it will both maximize the company's probability of winning the tender competition, and it will maximize the company's profit if it is chosen as the winner of the contract. Second, the incumbent could be replaced by others offering lower costs for the provision of the same services, hence lowering government costs for the provision of transportation services. The end results, as believed by economists and transportation planners, are that the government expenditures on transportation services are reduced, and/or the quality of services provided is increased.====Although CT has been promoted as a mechanism for providing transportation services at the least expensive level for governments, there is still no conclusive evidence on whether it reduces government expenditures; see, for instance, Pollitt and Bouckaert (2004) in the case of the public sector in general and Hensher and Wallis (2005) in the case of the transportation sector. Hensher and Wallis (2005), for instance, observed that, when savings do occur, they typically result from a first-time tendering process and can retract significantly when retendering. Moreover, recent empirical and theoretical work has suggested that CT affects the ownership structure -- see Aarhaug and Fearnley (2016) -- and that such changes can reduce the efficiency of CT; see, for instance, Mathisen (2016). An overall observation from the literature is that the working of CT is circumstantial, depending on the specific situation considered. This fact was evidenced in Hensher and Wallis (2005), ceteris paribus, attesting that the literature has been inconclusive with respect to how CT affects the operational costs/efficiency of transportation services.====In this paper, we assess the impact of CT on the operational costs and the impact on market concentrations in the case of the Norwegian car ferry sector. We thus contribute to the debate on the workings of CT in the transportation sector, with the Norwegian car ferry sector as a case study, understanding that car ferries are an integral part of the road systems in many countries, e.g., Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Scotland, Canada, the United States and Turkey. For a review on tendered ferry services in Europe, see e.g. Baird & Wilmsmeier (2011). Car ferries transport vehicles from one road end to the other and are thus very similar to public transport in operations. Another similarity to public transport is that car ferry link services, like bus or rail routes, are operated by private companies and are largely subsidized by central or regional governments. Therefore, this study is comparable to studies that have examined the impact of CT on costs in public transport.====The scientific contributions of this paper to the transportation literature are twofold. First, we bring experience on how CT has influenced the operational costs of the car ferry sector, which has been considered less often in the literature, in terms of the impacts of CTs, although it is an important sector in the provision of transportation services worldwide. The operations of the car ferry sector are very similar to the provision of public transport services in general; thus, the conclusions drawn in the present study are value added to the overall literature on how CT influences the operational costs of public transport services. Second, we address the impact of CT on market concentration. If CT leads to market concentration, its long-term effects could be monopolistic/duopolistic tendencies rather than free competition as intended by CT, contrary to the intentions of implementing CT. The literature on transportation has not addressed this issue adequately.====We proceed as follows in the rest of the paper. In section 2, we offer a brief overview of the developments in subsidies/procurement regimes in the Norwegian car ferry sector. Section 3 is a short literature review on how CT has worked in the transportation sector. Sector 4 describes the methodological framework used to assess the impact of CT on operational costs and the impacts of CT on market concentration. Section 5 describes the data used.

From the perspectives of optimizing the construction of transportation infrastructure (Pan, Ning, & Shi, 2019), valuing environmental factors (Pérez-Martínez & Vassallo-Magro, 2013.), and ensuring the sustainable development of freight transport (Gatta, Marcucci, Nigro, Patella, & Serafini, 2019; Islam, Meier, Aditjandra, Zunder, & Pace, 2013; Maggi & Vallino, 2016), this is a problem worthy of study. The relationship between freight transport development and economic growth has always been of interest to transportation economists (Garcia, Levy, Limão, & Kupfer, 2008; McKinnon, 2007; Moschovou, 2017; Tapio, 2005) and is one of the most important issues for policy makers (SACTRA, 1999; European Commission, 2003, European Commission, 2016). Scholars have tried to find a new balance point between economic development and freight demand by managing demand (Schulte & Ny, 2018; Teoh, Kunze, Teo, & Wong, 2018), improving measures (Kin, Verlinde, Mommens, & Macharis, 2017), and promoting energy efficiency (Kin, Ambra, Verlinde, & Macharis, 2018; Tiwari & Gulati, 2013; Wehner, 2018), so as to reduce the negative externalities of freight transport (Ranieri, Digiesi, Silvestri, & Roccotelli, 2018). The transportation industry has gone through a process of development and growth similar to that of other industries ranging from agriculture to service. This economic growth has a significant positive correlation with freight growth in the industrial development stage (Alises, Vassallo, & Guzmán, 2014). The development of transportation and freight can be aligned with the economic growth of a region in order to better guide the sustainable development of the transportation industry.====In recent years, the levels of transport intensity and decoupling indices have been widely used in the empirical analysis of the relationship between economic development and freight transport demand (Banister, David, Stead, & Dominic, 2002; Gilbert & Nadeau, 2002). Some scholars (Kveiborg, Ole, Fosgerau, & Mogens, 2007; McKinnon & Woodburn, 1996) believe that when analyzing this decoupling relationship, we should consider only industrial sector production rather than GDP because industrial production, such as in the mining industry, will have higher tonne-kms than service industry production (McKinnon, 2007). This means that when including the expansion of the service industry, economic growth will be higher than the growth of freight demand (Åhman, 2004). However, Meersman and Van de Voorde (2003) come to the opposite conclusion. They study the relationship between several economic indicators, including GDP and freight transport, and believe that the impact of industrial production changes on freight transport is relatively small.====Other scholars propose that economic growth should be linked with freight demand. Bennathan et al.’s (1992) study on tonne-kms as an indicator supports the linear hypothesis between economic development and freight demand. Beyzatlar, Karacal, and Yetkiner (2014) analyzes the per capita GDP inland turnover of freight traffic per person and gasoline fuel consumption per capita in the road sector of 15 EU countries from 1970 to 2008, and proves that there is a two-way relationship between GDP and freight. Moskovou (2017) also confirms that transport services promote economic development by studying the relationship between tonne-kms and GDP, and points out that the economic crisis has had a considerable negative impact on Greek road freight. This is consistent with the conclusion of Mitsakis et al.’s (2014) analysis of the economic crisis impact on the Greek transport sector. Rothengatter (2011) believes that the premise of economic recovery is the adjustment of the economic and transportation structure, which will make the transportation business more energy-saving and environmentally friendly.====Using time series data to analyze the relationship between freight (such as tonne-kms) and economic indicators (such as per capita GDP) is also recognized. For example, Verny (2007) uses time series data to study the relationship between freight, transportation distance, and economic development. Feige (2007) uses survey data to conduct econometric analysis on the relationship between transportation cost, trade volume, and GDP growth. It can be said that economic development cannot be separated from freight transport, but the stage of economic and social development has a great impact on transport intensity (Stead, 2001). This can be seen from the significant gap in transport intensity between developed and underdeveloped countries (SACTRA, 1999).====China's economy is in a critical period of transforming its development, optimizing its industrial structure, and revolutionizing its growth momentum. The level of economic development will have a direct impact on social production. As an important part of social production, the transportation industry will also face new challenges such as transformation mode, cost reduction and efficiency increase, and green environmental protection. The proposal of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” is also a huge test for land transportation facilities. In view of this, it is important to study the influence mechanism of various factors on freight transport in the process of economic development and explore changes in freight demand at different stages of economic development, so as to improve freight transport efficiency and optimize the scale of facilities.====Chinese scholars have also carried out relevant research on the relationship between domestic economic development and freight transport. Rong (2001) divides transportation into three stages: pre-transportation, transportation, and post-transportation. He believes with continuous advancement of the transportation stage, freight traffic shows the trend of initially rising, then stabilizing, and finally declining. Zhang, Jin, and Tang (1994) analyzes the domestic and foreign transportation industry activities and socio-economic backgrounds showing that the density and intensity of goods generation decrease with economic growth. Hu et al. (2009), He, Zhu, and Zheng (2016), and Guo et al. (2018) show the existence of positive externalities of transportation, and think that the volume of transportation has a significant positive impact on economic development. Wang et al. (2009) and Wei et al. (2014) think that in the development of transportation, there are regional differences in the contribution of the economy to economic growth; different regions should adapt to different transportation development strategies and plans. Ding, Xie, and Yao (2011), Cai, Liu, and Fang (2017), and Cai et al. (2017) analyze the per capita urban road area to show an inverted U-shaped trend with the growth of per capita GDP, a long-term, balanced, inverted U-shaped interaction effect between transportation and economic growth, and a U-shaped curve between per capita output and the contribution of transportation infrastructure.

(2017) and Li, Yang, and Wu (2018) believe that there is a synergistic relationship between transportation and economy, and the two exhibit mutual advancement.====Existing literature uses data of either multiple countries or a single region to conduct in-depth studies on the relationship between freight transport and stages of economic development. This provides a useful reference for us to carry out innovative research on the relationship between the two at the provincial level in China. At present, most of the research focuses on the reasons for the one-way and two-way relationships between freight transport and the economy. However, the relationship between freight transport and economic indicators in China has not been comprehensively analyzed at the provincial level. To fill this gap, this study uses provincial-level data from 1997 to 2017 to analyze the freight demand and economic development indicators in China. This paper contributes to the literature by using the decoupling index and transport intensity to analyze the relationship between the turnover of freight traffic per person and per capita GDP of provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, and studying the spatial distribution characteristics of this relationship. We simultaneously use an econometric model to analyze the non-linear relationship between the turnover of freight traffic per person and per capita GDP. China has a vast territory and there are great differences in economic structure, degree of development, and freight demand among provinces. It is believed that research based on the provincial level data of China will be indicative of the country overall and will have universal significance. We hope the conclusions of this study can provide useful support for managers to plan and develop the transportation industry.",The relationship between freight transport and economic development: A case study of China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300834,11 July 2020,2020,Research Article,171.0

This results in a significant reduction in the time that goods spend at intermodal terminals, where transshipment takes place. Drayage refers to the transport of freight on trucks among intermodal terminals, depots, customers and suppliers. In spite of the fact that drayage only represents between 5 and 10 percent of total distance, it may amount up to more than 30 percent of the total costs. The aim of this work is to study drayage operations. First, an extensive literature review is undertaken. Since the intermodal transport chain can become more efficient by means of a proper organisation of the drayage movements, the optimization of the daily drayage problem has been identified as one of the main ways of reducing the drayage cost and improving intermodal operations. On this problem, the lack of a common benchmark has hindered reaching further conclusions from all the research carried out. Therefore, this paper proposes a common framework and presents a generalized formulation of the problem, which allows modeling most drayage policies, with the limitation of only considering one-container problems. Results show that flexible tasks in the repositioning of empty containers as well as soft time windows can reduce the operating costs and facilitate the management of drayage companies. This work may help consider adequate policies regarding drayage operations in intermodal terminals.","Nowadays, long chains of transport are responsible for connecting customers around the world, eliminating geographic barriers between production and consumption. This has fostered globalization, which requires efficient transport management.====Among the modes of transport, maritime transport is the most common option for long-distance journeys. However, being lacking in flexibility, it is necessary to synchronize maritime shipments, port-to-port, with other means of transport, such as rail and road transport. This concept is known as multimodal transport.====Among the different methods of good transportation, the largest growth occurs in intermodal transport, a type of multimodality. It consists of using different means of transport to carry a load unit, usually containers. This feature allows for a reduction of the time that goods must spend in intermodal terminals because operations of loading and unloading of goods from one container to another are replaced by operations of collecting and delivering containers between different means of transport.====With all this, this paper focuses on drayage operations. These operations usually take place at the beginning and the end of the intermodal transport chain and include the collection and delivery of empty and loaded containers in depots, terminals and customers’ facilities. These containers are carried among different locations in the area of an intermodal terminal by road.====Even though drayage operations only represent a small percentage of the total distance in the intermodal chain, these amount to a high percentage of the total cost (Escudero-Santana, 2013; Spasovic & Morlok, 1993). The optimization of drayage operations represents an effective way to foster intermodal transport. Moreover, given that drayage movements usually take place near urban areas, adequate planning of drayage operations results in an indirect improvement of the environmental conditions and other external costs (Chen et al., 2013; Demir et al., 2015).====There are several types of drayage movements. The main movements are the freight importation and exportation orders, where the load unit (usually a container) is moved between the terminal and the customer or vice versa. In these instances, the container could be either full or empty, but the origin and destination of the movement are known (well-defined orders). Another possible type of drayage order is the repositioning of empty containers. This is necessary for the logistic activities of different customers. In this case, the movement could be carried out directly from or to the depot, known as direct-depot movement. In addition, empty containers that need to be withdrawn from a customer can be transferred directly to another customer in need for them. This is referred to as turn-street movement. Thus, there exist different possibilities for fulfilling the requirements, and some aspects of the orders are therefore flexible.====These orders are carried out by trucks, which are composed of tractors, trailers chassis and containers. Trucks perform two fundamental operations, collection and delivery of containers. A basic order usually involves a collection operation, a displacement, and a delivery operation.====Additionally, more complex orders are possible. As seen above, the need to have containers available at different points at certain times makes the transport of empty containers essential. Thus, sometimes it is necessary to alternate tasks of delivery and collection of containers at a given point. This may be caused by the client lacking sufficient space to store containers or a lack of additional containers to make other shipments. Two solutions are feasible: the driver stands by the container while it is unloaded, which is referred to as stay-with policy, or the driver leaves after the delivery of the container, known as drop and pick policy. In this case, an unloaded truck (not necessarily the vehicle that delivered the goods) will be required once the container is empty.====The daily drayage problem (DDP) has been the most studied problem of this area of research. This problem can be stated as follows (Jula et al., 2005): a set of containers needs to be moved in the area of an intermodal terminal by a trucking company. A set of trucks, initially located at the company depot, is deployed to move these containers among the depot, customers and terminals. Associated with each container there are time windows imposed by the customer and the terminal. The DDPTW is a relaxation of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). However, the procedures developed for the VRPTW are not well suited for the relaxation of the problem (Dumas et al., 1995).====Many authors have contributed to this area in order to address the necessity for specific methods. After an extensive literature review on drayage operation optimization using mathematical methods, we have found out that most of the works presented focus on the efficiency of their approaches. Besides, there exists a lack of a common framework or benchmark to develop these studies, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions.====Therefore, it is necessary to create a common benchmark to study the effect of different policies regarding the management of drayage operations. This work undertakes that goal and proposes a generalized formulation and benchmark for the comparison of different policies.====In addition to the proposed common framework, this paper provides an extensive review and analysis of how certain policies can influence the performance of haulage operations. Two policies have been studied: the effect of flexible tasks in the repositioning of empty containers and the effect of allowing soft time windows (a research angle neglected so far). The study presents several simplifications. Noticeably, that a truck can only carry one container at a time.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 identifies the methodology used in the review process. Section 3 provides a review of related works, identifying the contribution of each paper. Section 4 presents a deep formulation and description of the problem. Section 5 analyses the experiments conducted in previous studies and establishes the proposed benchmark.

This new travel mode meets people's requirements for comfort and convenience and overcomes the restrictions of the fixed routes and schedules of public transportation; it is becoming an increasingly important part of urban residents' travel service system. Ride-hailing and bike-sharing are developing well as market segments. By the end of 2017, more than 23 million shared bikes had been put into use worldwide, with nearly 400 million registered users.==== In 2018, ride-hailing platforms carried 20 billion passengers.====However, the social impacts of shared travel are unclear. Scholars have attempted to clarify this issue by studying the influence of ride-hailing on the traditional taxi industry (Contreras & Paz, 2018; Rayle, Dai, Chan, Cervero, & Shaheen, 2016; Wallsten, 2015), traffic safety (Brazil & Kirk, 2016; Greenwood & Wattal, 2017; Morrison, Jacoby, Dong, Delgado, & Wiebe, 2017), traffic congestion (Li et al., 2016b), and private car ownership (Vanderschuren & Baufeldt, 2018). Several scholars have also studied the impact of shared bikes on the urban environment (Pelechrinis et al., 2015; Zheng, Gu, Zhang, & Guo, 2019). However, few scholars have investigated the impact of ride-hailing and bike-sharing on public transport. Further, the findings on how ride-hailing impacts public transport differ depending on the studies’ different research objects and research areas. In particular, little research has been done on China. The literature on how shared bikes impact public transport is even scarcer.====Online ride-hailing has increased the convenience of travel but has also been questioned by many. Balancing convenience with doubt and regulating ride-hailing platforms efficiently are posing challenges for authorities. In July 2016, China's Ministry of Transport and seven other departments jointly promulgated the Interim Measures on the Management of Online Reservation Taxi Service, thus affirming the legitimacy of ride-hailing. Subsequently, some cities implemented rules tailored to their situation. These legitimation measures mean that ride-hailing platforms have been recognized by the government, which has improved their ability to attract and obtain resources and increased their market share, thus exacerbating the impact of ride-hailing on public transportation. This new perceived legitimacy encourages consumers to use shared services (Auer, 2019), thus increasing the impact of online ride-hailing on public transport. Its new legitimacy is likely causing ride-hailing to impact public transportation in terms of both platforms and consumers. Therefore, two research questions emerge: (1) Do ride-hailing and bike-sharing impact bus and rail transit, and (2) is this impact affected by the legitimacy of ride-hailing?====This study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it complements the current research on the impact of ride-hailing on public transport. We not only study how ride-hailing influences bus and rail transit, but also include the legitimacy of ride-hailing in the analysis to reveal the nature of its moderating mechanism. Second, this study adds to the research on the impact of shared bikes on public transport. The only extant study on this topic focused on Beijing and examined how bike-sharing affected its subway. However, many cities do not have a subway, and the study's results are not applicable to them. Using data drawn from 273 cities, this study investigates not only how shared bikes impact the subway but also how they impact buses. The results are therefore more general than are those of previous studies. Finally, this study can be used as a reference to guide analyses of regions where online ride-hailing is still considered illegitimate.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The two division are linked to each other by passenger volume and transportation income. The results show that the overall average efficiency value of China's railway passenger transportation sector is 0.629, with transporting efficiency of 0.717 and income-translated efficiency of 0.625. Although the passenger volume and transportation income need to be increased, the performance of transportation income is worse due to price regulation. More importantly, the paper finds that the increase in ","Due to relatively low ticket prices and high safety, railways are the most popular means of transportation for people in China,==== particularly in the 21st century as its railway passenger transportation sector has achieved great development. For instance, the speed of trains has increased by six times, while up to the end of 2015 the total length of railway lines hit 120,000 km.==== Benefiting from this great achievement, the country's railway passenger transportation sector has changed from a ‘pure seller's market’ to a ‘seasonal seller's market’ in the past few years, where the demand for railway transportation is greater than the capacity of the system during peak times such as holiday seasons. In addition, due to fast economic development and significant increases in income, people in China have started looking at other modes of transportation such as airplane and private cars (Caves & Swanson, 2001).==== The mode of travel nationwide offers more options, and the market competition faced by China's railway sector is becoming more intense. (see Table 6)====The China government has attempted market reforms in the area of capital structure of the railway sector since the 1990s by introducing private capital. However, according to data in China Railway Yearbook (2015), the proportion of state-owned capital in the railway passenger transportation sector was still 99.6% in 2014. Thus, the state-owned monopoly capital structure still exists, which means that the goal of improving efficiency by introducing private capital failed. Compared to the difficult reforms of capital structure, enterprise reforms have made great progress in this sector. Following the State Council's Institutional Reform and Functional Transformation Plan (2013),==== China's Ministry of Railways was replaced by China Railway Corporation, which encompassed 18 local railway bureaus. Furthermore, the reform of other local railway bureaus started in September 2017, with them being renamed as railway companies. The aim of this paper is to examine the effect that reforms made in the Chinese railway industry have had on productive efficiency.====In transportation sector, since the passenger transportation can be regarded as a passengers' movement between different locations (transporting process) and an income-translated process where income is translated from passenger volume which is the output of transporting process. As it is known, China's railway bureaus have poured a great amount of resources to improve transportation ability and still face strict price regulation. Therefore, apart from measuring the overall efficiency of China's railway passenger transportation sector, it is necessary to open ‘black box’ of transporting passengers to calculate the transporting efficiency and income-translated efficiency respectively. The effect of price regulation can also be investigated furtherly in this way. This paper hence uses the dynamic network SBM (DNSBM) model provided by Tone and Tsutsui (2014) to evaluate the performance of China's railway passenger transportation. Different from previous studies, in this paper, passenger transporting process is divided into two different divisions (transporting and income-translated). Currently, all researches focus on the former division which is named as operating process in these papers and few pay attention to the later process. However, in China, there is a fact that railway bureaus can transport a large amount of passengers and earn a great amount of revenue, but the net profit is extremely low. Taking year of 2018 for example, compared with the revenue of 737,713,851 thousand yuan, the profit only accounts for 2.3% with 17,198,138 thousand yuan. In addition, the total debt of railway bureaus is 720,532,073 thousand yuan, which means if not paying attention, it is likely to cause serious financial problems. So, when analyzing the efficiency of railway bureaus, transporting division is not the only objective. The income-translated is also important and should be taken into account. Therefore, based on the analysis of results measured by DNSBM model, this paper tries to evaluate furtherly whether current policies are efficient and provides suggestions if necessary. Last but not least, though China Railway Corporation has 21 s tier subsidiaries, including 18 local railway bureaus and 3 specialized transportation companies, only passenger transportation is discussed in this paper and 3 specialized transportation companies is excluded.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The study is an application of IIOM in transportation strikes and has usefulness for the policymakers, researchers, and readers that has an interest in application and extensions of Input-Output based analysis.","Transportation is an important activity because it contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country through its contribution of employability, moments of goods and people across the country. In recent year's transportation sector contributed 5.6 per cent and 5 per cent to the United States and European Union (EU) economies, respectively. Furthermore, the transport sector employee's 13.3 million workers in the USA and about 10 million in EU (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016) and (EU Science Hub, 2019).====In the present era, the importance of transportation increased more due to its strong backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy. There is an increase in the world population and there is an increase in the need for travel for work and leisure activities and more goods are needed to be transported to meet the needs of an ever-growing population. E-Commerce and global connectivity also increased the need for time bond logistics arrangements for firms and thus making the transportation sector more demanding to respond to these challenges. Transportation and logistics become vital in modern business because with increasing development in information and communication technologies, now business is based on time bond deliveries to the customers. Supply chain efficiency is one of the factors that influence customer satisfaction greatly (Heikkilä, 2002).====A profitable supply chain and hence the business cannot be ensured without efficient and effective logistic arrangements. Many sectors of the economy are strongly based on transportation sectors. For instance, agricultural products cannot be delivered from fields to markets and from markets to consumers without transportation. Workers are strongly dependent on transport for daily commutes etc. However, there may be several phenomena's that may cause delays or disruption in the transportation and logistics activities. For instance, weather (Sabir, Van Ommeren, Koetse, & Rietveld, 2011), natural calamity (e.g. (Pregnolato, Ford, Wilkinson, & Dawson, 2017),) or man-made events such as transportation strikes or demonstrations that influence or halt transportation activities. Public transport or goods transport strikes are a common phenomenon in developed and developing countries. For instance, Van Exel and Rietveld (2001) studied travel behaviour changes based on thirteen studies of public transport strikes that took place during 1966–2000 period in Europe and the USA. The public transport strikes mostly affect commuters resulting in either cancellation of their trips because of non-availability of transport service or pushing commuters to switch to car usage increasing road congestions (Van Exel & Rietveld, 2001).====In developing countries, public transport strike cause even worse situations (compared to developed countries) due to higher demand for public transport, lesser or no alternatives availability and lack of rule of law during such situations. Due to the interconnectivity of the various sectors of the economy, the impact of transport strike may spread across the rest of the sectors of the economy. For instance in Pakistan, the majority of good supply is undertaken via road transport from Karachi port (in the south) to the rest of the country. A strike from goods transport association on May 9, 2017, that continued for 10 consecutive days resulted in piling up of cargo and containers at the port. Export consignments were also delayed due to an insufficient number of containers throughout the country. This strike paralyzed Karachi's port activities and caused billions of rupees losses to exporters, manufacturer, and traders across the country.====The scholarly literature that focuses on studying public transport strikes is mostly focused on the travellers or the resulted economic or environmental losses (as described in the literature review). Some studies do discuss the suspension of logistic services and their impact on firm performance or profitability. However, there is hardly any scholarly study that is focused on the impacts of transportation strikes on the other sectors of the economy despite being strong inter-dependence of transport and logistics activities with rest of the sectors in the economy. This study contributes to the literature by studying the good transport strike impacts on the rest of the economy while taking a case of transport strike from Pakistan. Furthermore, the use of Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIOM) technique in this study is an interesting application of IIOM models in transportation economics domain. The study has usefulness for transport economists, business managers, business supply chain and operation managers that are directly and indirectly dependent on transportation and logistics for their business. Besides that, it has interesting findings for policymakers in terms of gauging various monetary costs that transport strikes may impose on other sectors of the economy.====The rest of the study is organized as follows: Section 2 is a literature review that discusses the literature on the transport disruption and its impacts. It also presents and discusses the literature on Inoperability Input-Output methods. Section 3 starts with a brief profile of Pakistan and its transportation sector followed by a description of the transportation strikes in Pakistan that happened most recently.

Many modern vehicles are implementing some automation features such as lane departure warnings, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems, and test vehicles have already been allowed onto public roads in some areas (Bagloee, Tavana, Asadi, & Oliver, 2016; Steward, 2017; The Tesla Team, 2016). Integrating CAVs into the fleet is expected to have many benefits. The most commonly referenced benefit is an increase in vehicle safety and a reduction in collisions (Bagloee et al., 2016; Bansal & Kockelman, 2017; Bullis, 2011; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Lutin, Kornhauser, & MASCE, 2013). By removing human distractions and relying on the much faster reflexes of an autonomous system, advocates of CAVs hope to greatly reduce or even eliminate collisions altogether (Anderson et al., 2014; Lutin et al., 2013; Maddox, 2012). Other anticipated benefits include a reduction in congestion, more environmentally friendly vehicles, greater mobility for those unable to drive, increased road capacity, reduced fuel consumption, increased productivity, and more predictable travel times (Anderson et al., 2014; Bagloee et al., 2016; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Kunze, Ramakers, Henning, & Jeschke, 2011).====CAVs may also have additional benefits to freight transportation. Automation may reduce the number of drivers required to move goods, greatly reducing the overall cost of transportation operations and providing a possible answer to driver shortage issues (Rossman, 2017; Shankwitz, 2017). Between reducing labor costs and increased fuel efficiency, CAVs have the potential to alleviate the two largest costs of freight transportation organizations (Anderson et al., 2014; Bagloee et al., 2016; Bullis, 2011; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Kockelman et al., 2017; Shankwitz, 2017). Automation will also increase the comfort of drivers, which may in turn help organizations address the issue of frequent driver turnaround. Overall productivity may also increase if CAVs lead to changes in regulations regarding the number of hours of service a driver may work before he or she is required to rest.====However, despite the potential benefits to CAV technology, a number of issues with CAVs remain unresolved. Aside from operational concerns, questions about legality, liability, security, privacy, and infrastructure must be addressed before CAVs can be fully adopted by the public. However, it is difficult to prepare for these problems unless policymakers and legislators know how quickly the public is likely to adopt CAVs.====Some studies have already been performed to estimate the adoption of CAVs for private consumers (Lavasani, Jin, & Du, 2016; Talebian & Mishra, 2018), but despite the depth of research in the field of innovation adoption behavior, one area of study that has received less attention from academia is the behavior of organizations such as corporations and governmental agencies. While some studies have been performed regarding organizational innovation adoption behavior (Crossan & Apaydin, 2010; Damanpour, 1991; Damanpour & Schneider, 2006; N.; Kim & Srivastava, 1998; Pierce & Delbecq, 1977; Rye & Kimberly, 2007; Simpson, Mishra, Talebian, & Golias, 2019; Subramanian & Nilakanta, 1996), these studies tend to be theoretical in nature, examining the effects of specific aspects of organizational adoption behavior such as managerial influence (Damanpour & Schneider, 2006; Leonard-Barton & Deschamps, 1988) or the structure of the organization (Damanpour, 1992; Moch & Morse, 1977; Pierce & Delbecq, 1977). While these studies are useful in that they provide further insight into the factors that influence organizational innovation adoption behavior, they fail to establish a solid baseline from which other works may begin (Crossan & Apaydin, 2010).====The purpose of this study is to establish a generalized methodology for estimating organizational innovation adoption behavior using a hypothetical dataset regarding the adoption of Connected Autonomous Trucks (CATs). Utilizing the findings of previous studies in the field of organizational innovation adoption behavior, a discrete choice modeling framework is developed to estimate the adoption of CATs by transportation organizations. This model incorporates elements from both traditional innovation adoption theories and peer effects research. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The following section briefly discusses the various innovation and organizational variables that influence the innovation adoption process. Section 3 provides details about the methodology used in the paper, and section 4 contains a simplified demonstration of the methodology.

The recent reviews by Jasti and Kodali (2015) and Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan (2018) highlight the latest contributions and developments in this area. Lean Manufacturing is based on a list of managerial practices (see Shah and Ward (2007) for a comprehensive list) and induces manufacturing efficiency and productivity, higher sales and business performance, consumer satisfaction and value (Yang, Hong, & Modi, 2011). The implementation of Lean Practices allows firms to achieve a certain level of Leanness, which is defined by Genc and De Giovanni (2018) as the firms’ capacity to be Lean.====Nevertheless, a relevant debate has recently emerged in the literature regarding the impact of Leanness on the environment. On the one hand, Leanness mitigates the negative impact of operations on the environment through the usage of environmentally friendly materials, waste and pollution reduction and time saving (Genc & De Giovanni, 2017). On the other hand, the implementation of some Lean practices can also be environmentally harmful. For example, a key principle of Lean Manufacturing is being consumer-focused, thus flexible production processes and systems ensure product customization and satisfaction. At the same time, firms offering customized goods must renounce to certain lot sizing policy and process standardization, while inducing more waste over the production process (Venkat & Wakeland, 2006). This unclear situation not only belongs to manufacturers but it also involves the entire Supply Chain. For example, when VW's diesel gate had implications for VW itself as well as for all suppliers belonging to its SC. Accordingly, the relationship between Lean Manufacturing and environment should be better investigated because the related environmental implications involve the entire Supply Chain. Nowadays, Supply Chains are becoming Green Supply Chains since legislation and governments impose restrictions at a global level and put in place stringent monitoring green practices on the value chain at large. Then, firms implement Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), which is defined as “a set of programs adopted within the supply chain to improve environmental performance of processes and products in the forms of environmental management system, Life-Cycle Analysis, Design for Environment, Environmental certification” (De Giovanni & Vinzi,2014a).====Mollenkopf, Stolze, Tate, and Ueltschy (2010) provide an excellent survey on the links between Leanness and GSCM, revealing that some empirical research is still needed to clarify the existing relationships between them. Accordingly, we check whether the adoption of some Lean practices enhances both the collaboration on green programs (Green Supply Chain Management - GSCM) and its impact on environmental performance. In this sense, we seek to verify whether Leanness is a driver for greenness. That is, we aim at better assessing the SCs’ attitudes to be green as well as the green benefits obtained through traditional Lean Manufacturing practices. ====, we address the impact of both Leanness and GSCM on operational and economic performance to verify whether the joint effect of Leanness-GSCM grants better performance outcomes.====In addition, we look at some managerial practices through which the earlier mentioned links can be strengthened. Given the current pressure that firms and SCs have on digital transformation, we focus our analysis on the process innovation entailed by the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. The latter directly influence the production process and create smart factories. In particular we refer to the use of Robotics, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV), 3D printing, smart sensors, industrial Internet of Things, and advanced human-machine interface (Ivanov, Dolgui, & Sokolov, 2019). The literature has largely shown the benefits that investments in process innovation supply to operations (e.g., Preeker & De Giovanni, 2018). Nevertheless, a research gap still exists on whether the adoption of I4.0 technologies allows the pair Leanness-GSCM to be more effective and generate a higher impact on performance.====We investigate several research questions by testing hypotheses through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and by using a sample of 172 cross-national and cross-industry European firms. Therefore, we use a Multi-group analysis to test whether the implementation of I4.0 process innovation technologies strengthens the links among Leanness, GSCM and performance.====Our results reveal that Leanness is an effective option to achieve better environmental outcomes. In contrast, Leanness offers a positive contribution to economic performance only in the long run through the indirect effects: In this sense, Leanness allows firms to increase both the operational and the environmental performance in the short run while it grants higher environmental benefits only in the long run. Furthermore, GSCMs allow firms to improve performance overall. Thus, if companies aim at improving their economic performance in the short term, they should opt for GSCM rather than targeting Leanness. In contrast, both Leanness and GSCM enhance both environmental and operational performance in the short term. Finally, higher environmental performance translates into high economic performance only in the long term; consequently, economic outcomes are a major challenge within the framework of Leanness and GSCM.====Our findings demonstrate that process innovation lowers the firms’ willingness to pursue GSCM, while it positively impacts on operational performance directly and economic performance indirectly. Interestingly, our findings reveal that firms can increase their performance by investing either in process innovation or by doing GSCM, but not by implementing both of them. Also, economic performance remains a second order target even in the presence of I4.0 process innovation investments.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we provide the conceptual framework and develop the research hypotheses. Second, we describe both the data and the methodology used to test our hypotheses. Finally, we conclude by providing a discussion, deriving some managerial implications from the findings, and highlighting the research limitations and future research directions to be undertaken.","Process innovation through industry 4.0 technologies, lean practices and green supply chains",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300676,13 June 2020,2020,Research Article,177.0

Understanding the determinants of e-grocery shopping is important for grocers, ==== managers, and urban planners. In this context, we first explore how deliveries from online shopping have been changing over time. From our analysis of the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we found that online shopping has been embraced by increasingly diverse households, although income, education, and some racial/ethnic differences persist. Our analysis of the 2017 American Time Use Survey shows that Americans are 24 times more likely to shop for groceries in stores than online. Moreover, in-store grocery shoppers are more likely to be female and unemployed, but less likely to belong to younger generations, to have less than a college degree, or to be African American. The gender imbalance in grocery shopping is larger online than in stores, but e-grocery shoppers do not otherwise differ from the general population. Future travel and e-shopping surveys (especially for e-grocery) should combine time use and travel questions with retrospective questions about online purchases.","By expanding the range of products available to consumers, stimulating competition, and enhancing shopping convenience, e-commerce is changing the way people shop. Its popularity is growing. According to the Pew Research Center (====), four out of five Americans have purchased items online at least once (up from 22% in 2000). Globally, e-commerce is taking an increasing share of total retail sales, rising from 7.4% in 2015 to 11.9% in 2018 (====), travel (====; ====), the environment (====; ====), in-store shopping (====; ====).====The growth of online shopping (e-shopping) is far from homogeneous from a geographic point of view, however. For example, in 2018 online retail sales were approximately 28.6% of total consumer retail sales in China (====), versus less than 10% in the United States (====). Moreover, e-shopping in a given sector can differ widely even between countries that are culturally and economically similar. Indeed, despite an average annual growth of 18.7% between 2000 and 2016 (====), e-commerce sales of food, beer, and wine==== in the United States represent currently only 0.35% of total food and beverage purchases (====). By comparison, online sales made up 5.3% of total food retail sales in the UK (====), which outlines the need to study e-grocery in the United States, even though this topic has already received much attention elsewhere, especially in Europe.====In this context, this empirical study has two purposes. Our first purpose is to understand changes between 2009 and 2017 – two years selected because of data availability - in residential deliveries from online shopping in the United States. We focus on residential deliveries because national data on grocery deliveries from online purchases in the United States are not, as far as we know, publicly available. Understanding residential deliveries from e-shopping is clearly important to logistics managers (so they can supply warehouses serving residences), to transportation engineers (so they can maintain residential roads and adequately update their design), and to transportation planners (so they can mitigate the externalities of changing freight flows and accommodate new delivery options). Better quantifying the traffic and ==== of residential deliveries from online shopping is particularly of concern because soaring uncoordinated deliveries will increase residential traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution, and exacerbate parking shortages in dense urban areas.====Our second purpose is to characterize US households who are shopping online for groceries, which is salient because of the importance and the challenges of grocery retailing. Since we are not aware of any public national dataset on household deliveries of groceries in the US, an indirect way of analyzing e-grocery deliveries is to couple characterizations of e-grocers with an understanding of deliveries from online purchases, as analyzed in the first part of this paper. Although a number of papers have analyzed online shoppers (e.g., see ====; ====; ====; ====; or ====, and references herein), much of the recent literature has focused on Europe, and there is a dearth of academic research on e-grocery in the United States. Profiles of online shoppers generated by consultants for grocers can also be found online, but they typically rely on univariate analyses and none of the profiles we found analyzed datasets representative of the US population.====To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to analyze recent changes in residential deliveries from online shopping in the United States and to examine online grocery (e-grocery) shopping using publicly available survey data.====Our point of departure is the latest (2017) National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which we contrast with its previous edition, the 2009 NHTS. We analyze these two national surveys because they asked participating households how many deliveries from online shopping they received in the 30 days preceding their assigned survey day. To explain the number of these deliveries and understand how they changed between the 2009 and the 2017 NHTS, we estimate similar zero-inflated mixture models on 2009 (N = 134,371)==== and 2017 (N = 123,148) NHTS data, and test differences in model coefficients for these two years.====Since the 2017 NHTS does not ask about e-grocery shopping, we also analyze data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to contrast socio-economic characteristics of people who engage in online grocery shopping with conventional grocery shoppers. To do so, we first estimate logit models on a subset (N = 2934) of the 2017 ATUS to consider only households likely to have had access to e-grocery shopping in 2017. Since the number of people who shopped for groceries online in the 2017 ATUS is small, we compare the distributions of selected socio-economic characteristics of e-grocery shoppers with those of conventional grocery shoppers using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Finally, we contrast the distributions of shopping start times (i.e., when a customer starts browsing to buy groceries) between these two groups, since proponents of e-grocery shopping highlight the convenience of shopping at any time.====In the next section, we review how e-grocery shopping first emerged, assess what obstacles led to early failures, and explain how they were (at least partly) overcome. We then briefly discuss characteristics of e-shoppers in the United States, and review some potential impacts of e-shopping and e-grocery. In Sections ====, ====, we respectively present our data and introduce our modeling approach. In Section ==== we discuss our results. In Section ==== we summarize our findings, discuss potential impacts on local deliveries, outline some limitations of our study, and propose some avenues for future work.",E-shopping changes and the state of E-grocery shopping in the US - Evidence from national travel and time use surveys,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300627,12 May 2020,2020,Research Article,178.0

A case study examines the financial continuity of one such initiative in Sweden by exploring its cost structure, the relative importance of its revenue variables, and the variables that determine the ==== programme for a city logistics initiative. The initiative combines the consolidation of transportation of goods for both private enterprises and municipalities, and shows that the relationship between goods volumes and profitability is not linear, but rather follows a logarithmic shaped curve. A sensitivity analysis highlights the impact of goods volumes and ==== on the financial performance of the business model.","With urbanisation (UN, 2012), goods and traffic flows are rising along with the negative environmental effects of urban freight on cities. Many city logistics initiatives have been tested to overcome these effects with a clear potential to reduce environmental impacts. Unfortunately, these initiatives have often failed to become financially sustainable (Lindholm et al., 2014). Although the concept of city logistics has indicated beneficial outcomes – mostly for the stakeholders involved – numerous implementations have been fiscally unviable (Browne, Sweet, Woodburn, & Allen, 2005; Quak, 2008). A city logistics initiative needs to address the critical issues of financing (Benjelloun, Crainic, & Bigras, 2010) because one of its main barriers is financial continuity.====The current literature explains this as a lack of viable business models for city logistics (Björklund, Abrahamsson, & Johansson, 2017; Malhene, Trentini, Marques, & Burlat, 2012; Quak, Balm, & Posthumus, 2014). There is an inadequate awareness of financial feasibility and the need for viable business models in city logistics (Quak et al., 2014). As a result, many initiatives have started without considering financial continuity (Gonzalez-Feliu, 2012). Although several such initiatives have shown interesting results in the pilot implementation phase, they were unable to survive due to low profitability, which was often covered by public subsidies in the pilot phase (Gammelgaard, 2015; Gonzalez-Feliu, 2008). The initiatives depended on temporary governmental subsidies (Cagliano, De Marco, Mangano, & Zenezini, 2016; Dablanc, 2011; Macharis & Melo, 2011). Instead of addressing financial continuity, the focus of the initiatives has been on technical, environmental and operational feasibility. For instance, Ferrero, Perboli, Rosano, and Vesco (2018) point out that the initiatives often ignore the link between business and operational models, because they focus too much on technology, such as platforms and optimisation tools. The lack of focus on viable business models has also resulted in difficulties in coordinating the various goals of the many stakeholders in city logistics (Lagorio, Pinto, & Golini, 2016; Lindholm, 2010). This has led to a lack of support and commitment from the different stakeholders (Marcucci & Musso, 2010; Russo & Comi, 2012) and on different perspectives on how to improve the transport system, which may lead to conflicts of interest and missed opportunities to obtain the best possible solution (Taniguchi, 2014). A specific dilemma has been a lack of collaboration between the public and private sectors (BESTUFS, 2007), which has been materialised in rules, regulations, and policy measures that are perceived as unfair by the private sector (Gatta & Marcucci, 2014; Schoemaker, 2002; Taniguchi, 2014). Understanding the way the stakeholders collaborate helps to improve the policy-making process through consensus building, as it helps to integrate the goals of different private stakeholders’ into a package of policy measures (LePira et al., 2017; Marcucci & Musso, 2010). It also affects the financial continuity as it helps to understand the inefficiency of city logistics initiatives (Katsela & Browne, 2019).====A few cities have implemented successful business models. One example is the Binnenstadservice. nl (BSS) in the Netherlands, which was among the first initiatives to focus on receivers rather than transport providers. The BSS business model addresses the cost structure and revenue streams. BSS inspired a city logistics initiative in Copenhagen, which created value with value-adding logistics services in the business model (Gatta, Marcucci, Delle Site, Le Pira, & Carrocci, 2019of a city logistics solution that provides different value propositions in different contexts. In Berlin, a pack station consolidates shipments from several service providers to be delivered to households with vehicles suitable for the inner city area (====). In Lyon, France, and Turin, Italy, the value proposition of BentoBox is a docking station with removable trolleys.====The research on business models in city logistics offers useful insights. Morana and Gonzalez-Feliu (2010) highlight the essential need to understand that the urban part of the transport is only the supply chain's last mile. Thus, the performance of city logistics should be evaluated in relation to the performance of the whole supply chain. Björklund et al. (2017) state that each business model should be contextualised, and in their study of five city logistics initiatives, they found seven critical factors to consider in all business models for city logistics. Three are particularly important: 1) scale up variable costs; 2) include logistics competence; and 2) utilise advanced IT. Several researchers have studied value-adding logistics services, such as providing external storage, consignment and price tagging, and conclude that such services can help to obtain viable business models for city logistics (Browne, Allen, & Leonardi, 2011; Malhene et al., 2012; Ville, Gonzalez-Feliu, & Dablanc, 2013).====The current research also shows that a viable business model must attract enough customers and achieve economies of scale (Allen, Browne, Woodburn, & Leonardi, 2014). This means that certain goods volumes are critical both for sufficient revenues and for allocating overhead costs to each delivery unit, such as a parcel (Brotcorne, Perboli, Rosano, & Wei, 2019; Quak et al., 2014). A major challenge is to identify and reach the break-even volume (Verlinde, Macharis, & Witloxa, 2012). To do so, the cost and revenue structures of city logistics must be understood, but this has drawn limited attention in the current literature. This paper presents knowledge that has been developed for business models in city logistics. It does so by providing detailed insights into the financial continuity of a city logistics initiative. The purpose is to explore the cost structure of such an initiative, the relative importance of its revenue variables, and the variables determining the economy of scale.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review and introduces city logistics initiatives, their financial performance, and viable business models. Section 3 presents the methodology of the case study, which is based on the implementation of a six-month pilot programme of sustainable, coordinated distribution of goods in a city logistics initiative in Sweden.

The logistics in this area is often challenging, especially considering the food characteristics and regulations. However, despite the relevance of the topic, the extant body of the scientific literature regarding the role of logistics in the food and grocery sector appears quite fragmented. This paper presents a ","The food and grocery retail sector is one of the most complex in terms of supply chain and logistics management, as it encompasses critical aspects of both the food and the retail logistics worlds. Indeed, the handling and transportation of food and groceries is subject to several requirements (i.e., maintaining cold-chain integrity, ensuring the product integrity of), strict norms, and sanitary regulations. Further, the necessity to account for product's fast perishability – that affects storage conditions, transportation, order frequency and times, temperature control, packaging, origin and traceability (Srivastava, Chaudhuri, & Srivastava, 2015) – originates additional constraints and requirements (e.g., use of vehicles and warehouses that guarantee the proper temperature, faster loading/unloading operations, and so forth).====At the same time, the food and grocery retail sector has to face issues that characterize many other retail sectors, such as the necessity to have a reliable demand forecast in order to support meeting the customers’ needs, to manage inventory and in-store shelves, and to ensure a continuous products supply (Alho & de Abreu e Silva, 2017).====Nowadays, technology is profoundly affecting and transforming the food and grocery retail sector to both address the abovementioned issues and exploit the new opportunities related to online retail operating models which combine the rapid digitalisation with local geography and consumption practices (De Kervenoael, Yanık, Bozkaya, Palmer, & Hallsworth, 2016). Due to this, competition in the retail food market has increased in recent years, and food retailers have faced fierce pressure from alternative channels including online retailers and grocery delivery services (Duff & Phelps, 2016). Partially driven by the ageing of the digital natives, so-called Millennials and Generation Z, traditional brick-and-mortar stores started exploiting new, online-based business models to provide better services to customers: this includes offering online shopping, home delivery, and click and collect services to allure more significant segments of customers, and to gain competitive advantage (Emeç, Çatay, & Bozkaya, 2016). Indeed, about 40% of e-customers consider delivery services a “must have” when purchasing food and grocery products, with 20% prepared to switch retailers if this service is not provided (Capgemini Resarch Institute, 2018). However, these online services introduce sizeable last mile logistics issues and cost concerns that require efforts, time and money to be solved considering that grocery margins are already thinner than the margin of many other products (Nielsen Report, 2015).====Although the relevance of the food and grocery retail sector is expanding, the literature regarding the retail logistics aspects in such a sector is quite fragmented. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to consolidate the knowledge, analyse the development and the evolution over time, clarify the trends, the main topics and the possible gaps linked to the role of the retail logistics in the food and grocery sector.

While it is a major topic in literature, and many models have been developed in the last decades to price real options, there is some reluctance on the adoption of these models by investors and managers due to its complexity. In this way, it is relevant that empirical contributions are made in order to better clarify how these models can be applied and their useful for practitioners and business managers (Lander & Pinches, 1998). That is what we have done with Ponta Delgada airport expansion case.====Ponta Delgada airport is the main gateway for visitors to the Azores and it is expected that activity at the Ponta Delgada airport will increase in the coming years due to the expected increase in the number of tourists in the Azores, and São Miguel in particular. Chambers (2007) mentions that the degree of success of a project in the transport sector is strongly associated with the demand for tourism and business, economic indicators such as GDP or per capita income, the price of gas and fuel, and general changes in consumer preferences. Trips are a mean to an end, not a motivation in themselves. So, it was assessed whether it is worth to implement an additional investment in the Ponta Delgada airport to avoid constraints and disruptions that could damage the quality of service when demand exceeds the capacity in place.====The framework used in this paper is Smit (2003) with minor adaptations. These adaptations are related to the value of the option on each node of the event tree according to Mun (2006) and the possibility to asses an investment deployed in two stages.====Empirical results show that Ponta Delgada airport value of assets in place is 311.2 million euros and total airport value is 312.5 million euros. In two-stage capacity expansion, growth option value is 1.3 million euros, higher than the growth option value in one-stage capacity expansion. The total value of the Ponta Delgada airport is higher than the value of assets in place since the airport management has a growth option to extend its capacity to capture the future growth opportunities that may arise from tourism activity in the Azores.====Following this introduction, the literature review is focused on the advantages of the real options analysis and how it has been treated by the practitioners, especially in the air transport sector.

Traffic convenience determines the capacity and attractiveness of a city. Cities with a developed transportation system can cover additional resources, and citizens tend to have access to favorable opportunities. Therefore, city governments tend to build subway lines to boost the social and economic development.====However, not all of people in cities need subway lines to the same extent. In accordance with their features and affordability, they can have heterogeneous preference towards subway lines (Yang, Chen, & Le, 2016). Even during a short time period, the preference of a same group of people can be unstable and varies regularly (Agostini & Palmucci, 2010). An investigation of this heterogeneous preference can help policy makers to recognize people in urgent need for subway and optimize the allocation.====A way to study people's preference towards subway lines is provided by Lancaster (1966). Since there is no explicit market for public infrastructure, the value of subway lines for citizens is embedded into the purchasing costs of housing. People should pay more for a recent subway line. This implied price shows people's willingness to pay for subway lines, as well as their deferential preference. A research on this heterogeneous price premium can be a theoretical foundation for land value capture to keep a fiscally sustainable urbanization.====Previous studies utilized a cross-sectional comparison to probe the price effects (Wang. 2017, Teng, Yan, & Zhou, 2014; Cervero & Duncan, 2002). As an outcome of endogeneity, the estimation in those papers is subject to biases (Ko & Cao, 2013; Pagliara & Papa, 2011). Furthermore, the price effects reflecting people's preference would vary over time and among sub-markets, which has not been investigated at the same time. The present study aims to fill those gaps and has two contributions to the present understanding of property value effects. On the one hand, this study applies a hedonic price model within a difference-in-differences (DID) framework to control unobserved factors and estimate property value effects precisely. On the other hand, this study elucidates the dynamics of a heterogeneous effect across different sub-markets, truncated based on the average property prices of the community. This improvement is helpful in determining the kind of property that has the highest price premium.====To achieve the mentioned goals, this study selects Hangzhou, China as the case study. Hangzhou is a regional central city in China, witnessing massive infrastructure construction in recent years. The subway has sprung up from nothing in the city center as well as the suburb. The change in Hangzhou reveals patterns about the citywide relation between property prices and local transportation operation in developing areas. Consequently, experience in Hangzhou can be a favorable example for urbanizing cities worldwide wherein large-scale subway constructions will occur.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Part 2 reviews previous literature about the property value effect caused by subways and the improvement that requires accurate dynamics. Part 3constructs the main model for estimating the price effects. Part 4 describes the quasi-experimental setting in Hangzhou and the corresponding variables. Part 5 presents the empirical findings on the dynamics of property value effects. The final part provides the discussions and conclusions drawn from this study.","Subway boosts housing values, for whom: A quasi-experimental analysis",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300330,21 April 2020,2020,Research Article,182.0

The article seeks to measure the importance of online shopping for everyday consumer goods (ECG), and to understand offline purchases and travel behaviour of click and pickup customers. The research is based on a survey conducted in 2016 among approximately 600 French households. The profile of click and pickup customers is revealed by a logistic regression. Purchasing practices and the timing of shopping activities are comprehended from cross tabulation and chi-square tests. The results show that despite the widespread use of e-commerce, shopping ECG online remains a minority practice. Using click and pickup outlets allows customers to fine-tune their purchasing, both in terms of organising their time and the retail formats they use. It enables them to adopt diversified purchasing practices that are more in line with the households' schedules and consumption requirements. Our results show that households are still committed to traditional forms of retail, for which travel remains necessary. The implications of online shopping regarding the number of trips must therefore be seen in perspective, even if our findings reveal a reorganisation of shopping, particularly concerning time.","In France, the online shopping sector for Everyday Consumer Goods (ECGs)==== remained very limited for a long time because the offerings were based on home delivery which struggled to attract a clientele, unlike in the United Kingdom, where delivery gained acceptance some time ago (Ranvier et al., 2009, Nielsen, 2019). But recently, the market shares of online shopping have increased, due in particular to the arrival of a more indirect method of obtaining purchases: click and pickup outlets (called ==== in French). Created in 2004 by Chronodrive, a subsidiary of the Auchan group (a major food retailer), click and pickup outlets are rapidly spreading. Today, they number over 4000 in France (Nielsen, 2016). A click and pickup outlet consists in either a warehouse, which may or may not be adjacent to a store belonging to the same chain (a dark supermarket), or a normal supermarket, where customers go to pick up their orders. They are based on the “click and collect” principle, by which the customer places an order on the chain's website beforehand and then has to go to the click and pickup outlet to collect the order during the agreed time slot. Due to the success of its click and pickup outlets, France has caught up with other countries, with the ECG online market reaching 7.1% of the ECG total market, compared with 6.3% in the United Kingdom (Nielsen, 2019).====The arrival of click-and-collect within the French retail landscape coincides with the crisis that has been affecting the mass retail sector since the end of the 1990s (Moati, 2016). Apart from the fact that they have no potential for further growth, supermarkets and hypermarkets==== are affected by changes in consumption behaviour. More and more French people are expressing their weariness with ECG shopping. While in 1986, only 10% of households considered ECG shopping to be a chore, by 2010 this had risen to 21%. This increase is even more striking among women, the working population, households with children and 35-54 year-olds (INSEE, Enquêtes Emploi du Temps 1986 and 2010). This weariness feeling concerns particularly supermarkets and hypermarkets, where 61% of French people consider shopping to be a chore (Moati, 2013, p.4). Despite that, these formats still very much dominate the retail sector, accounting for three-quarters of French people's food expenditure (Brousse, Ferrante, & Turner, 2015). Indeed, supermarkets and hypermarkets have long been successful thanks to several advantages compared to other traditional retail formats. First, the “all under one roof” principle, which allows various products to be bought in a single store when they were previously sold in different stores (Moati, 2001). Second, the principle of self-service sales, which permits lower pricing (Moati, 2001). And third, their peripheral location which suits with the evolution of lifestyles, especially the development of housing in the outskirts and the diffusion of automobile-centered lifestyles (Moati, 2016). Besides, supermarkets and hypermarkets allow households to stop shopping on a daily basis and do larger shop at weekends, on Saturdays (Gallouj, 2004), since they have a car to bring their shopping back home. It was thus particularly convenient for women in a period during which women's employment rose. Actually, between 1974 and 2010, the frequency of shopping trips had decreased and the duration of shopping for those who shop on a given day had increased. Thus the time budget allocated to shopping is constant, but Saturday shopping takes longer (Brousse et al., 2015).====The growth in online shopping, for ECGs as well as other types of goods, raises questions about its implications both in terms of logistics Dablanc, 2019, Marei, Aguiléra, Belton Chevallier, Blanquart, & Seidel, 2016, Simoni, Marcucci, Gatta, & Claudel, 2019 and mobility (Mokhtarian, 2004, Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden, 2013, Zhai et al., 2016). This paper focuses on this second issue. Gaining an understanding of shopping-related trips is important because they represent a significant proportion of daily trips and are mostly made by car.==== The large-scale increase in the use of ICTs (at work, for purchases or services, etc.) raises the question of the replacement of travel by ICTs, i.e. does ICT use allow people to travel less because they can work or buy at a distance? This question has been widely explored (Mokhtarian, 1990, 2002; Salomon, 1986) in the framework of a debate between the hypothesis of substitution and that of complementarity, according to which the use of ICT does not reduce the number of trips, but changes their nature or even generates new ones. This accounting approach to the links between the use of ICT and travel has been challenged because it merely involves counting the number of trips at the individual level and does not provide an understanding of how the use of ICTs changes the nature and organisation of travel (Aguiléra, Guillot, & Rallet, 2012). This approach also neglects the multiple roles of ICTs which combine and operate in multiple directions (Mokhtarian & Tal, 2013). ICTs affect travel behaviour, not only by reducing the number of trips, but by changing its patterns, but also travelling experience and the perception of travel costs (Cohen-Blankshtain & Rotem-Mindali, 2016). Moreover the impact of travel on ICT use should not be forgotten, since it is a two-way relation (Choo & Mokhtarian, 2007; Nobis & Lenz, 2009). Consequently, an alternative approach is to understand the role ICTs play in the spatial and temporal reorganisation of household activity schedules, which in turn has impacts on the location, timing and frequency of trips (Aguiléra et al., 2012). This paper thus addresses the impact of online shopping on travel by understanding the organisation of purchasing practices in space and time.====While these issues have been the subject of research, in the case of other types of goods, the development of ECG online shopping and click and pickup raises new questions about the implications of e-commerce on purchasing and travel practices. On the one hand, ECGs are specific types of goods which require frequent, regular trips, and some of which need temperature control. The results obtained for other goods, such as cultural products or intangible goods, are therefore not directly applicable to this sector. On the other hand, click and collect appears to be a particularly interesting form of e-commerce to study because, unlike home delivery, it requires customers to travel. This means that although households cannot eliminate a trip, we can expect click and pickup use to be accompanied by the reorganisation of purchasing and travel practices. It is therefore through the specific case of click and pickup that we will seek to establish to what extent the use of online shopping reshapes mobility, by examining more specifically the timing of shopping activities. This research is based on an ad hoc survey dating from 2016 and seeks to better characterise the inroads that have been made by click and pickup and quantify its importance, with a view to understanding the links between the use of click and pickup outlets and other shopping practices that do not involve the Internet, and to identify the travel associated with it, particularly with regard to the timing of shopping activities. After a literature survey, the paper presents the methodology implemented in the research. Then the results are explained and discussed before the conclusion.",Internet shopping for Everyday Consumer Goods: An examination of the purchasing and travel practices of click and pickup outlet customers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300068,22 January 2020,2020,Research Article,184.0

We demonstrate this policy with a stylized implementation of a city logistics agent based model for the inner city of Rotterdam. The results indicate that this financial scheme could positively influences the use of UCC, ensures its financial viability and significantly reduce the external effects of urban freight transport.","Consolidation of loads and collaboration in transport planning are amongst the most effective strategies for reducing urban freight related traffic (Browne et al., 2005a, Browne et al., 2005b; Macharis & Melo, 2011). Besides the external benefits, these strategies also reduce the use of transport resources such as personnel, trucks, and fuel. The strategies are often implemented by establishing an urban consolidation centre (UCC). Generally, a UCC is situated at the periphery of the city so that big trucks from shippers can easily access the UCC and deliver goods. Later, small, often environmental friendly, trucks are used to deliver goods to their recipient in a city. In Europe, many countries have started using UCC, but the anticipated benefits of UCC were seldom achieved (see (Balm, Browne, Leonardi, & Quak, 2014; Behrends, Lindholm, & Woxenius, 2008; Browne et al., 2005a, Browne et al., 2005b; Marcucci & Danielis, 2008; Melo, 2010; Olsson & Woxenius, 2014; Patier & Browne, 2010; Tsamboulas & Kapros, 2003; van Duin, , Quak andMunuzuri & Eds., 2008; Van Duin, Quak, & Muñuzuri, 2010; Verlinde, 2015; Wolpert & Reuter, 2012). In most cases these UCCs were fully subsidized by government. Once funding was reduced or halted, these UCCs were forced to shut down. Some UCCs changed their business model to become financially independent (Quak & Tavasszy, 2011). However, public support through regulation of the alternatives remained important and, eventually, only few have remained in operation.====The failures of UCC implementation have taught us that free UCC services cannot guarantee success. The original design of UCC assumed that if the UCC service was free and its use could reduce negative effects of urban logistics, then the service would gladly be adopted by associated stakeholders. However, for private stakeholders reduction of congestion and pollution are less relevant compared to the additional costs of using a UCC. In an UCC-setting, shopkeepers are free to choose between goods delivery through a UCC or direct delivery by a carrier. For shopkeepers, using the service of a UCC incurs extra handling of goods that may add up to extra delivery time and cost. Furthermore, it is also difficult to clearly point out the responsible party (the UCC or the carrier) in case of damage or error in goods delivery. If a shopkeeper is using a UCC, then the carrier does not need to deliver goods to a shop through the congested city areas. The carrier saves time and money by delivering goods to a UCC. However, the carrier does not give any discount to the shop whose goods are delivered via a UCC. Thus, a shopkeeper does not have any financial incentive for choosing a UCC over direct delivery by the carrier. Due to these reasons, shopkeepers do not easily opt for this service.====In a study done for New York City, Holguín-Veras (2008) explains that a balanced cost distribution between city logistics stakeholders is a necessary condition for success of a city logistics policy. These cases point out the fact that the economic aspect of cost distribution requires analyses from the viewpoint of multiple stakeholders. Their individual and aggregated behavioural responses should give an indication of the potential for solving city logistics related problems. Agent technology has capability to incorporate multiple stakeholders’ perspectives. Therefore, we use agent based model SMUrFS for analysing policy scenario for UCC.====In this paper, we focus on the testing of a new policy concept: delivery cap and price (DCAP) for urban delivery. The policy is inspired by the carbon credit point (CCP) mechanism that was designed in support of the implementation of the Kyoto protocol.==== Similar to the CCP mechanism where the cap is based on the volume of carbon emissions, the DCAP policy introduces a cap on the number of goods deliveries received by the shopkeeper. In broad sense, frequent ordering requires frequent transportation of delivery vehicles. If a shop is getting delivery from a supplier who is not supplying to any other shops in nearby areas then frequent ordering results in higher Co2 emission. With this reasoning it is assumed that by limiting number of direct deliveries by supplier carbon emission can be regulated. In our case, the delivery cap and price aims to reduce the number of truck-kilometres travelled by conventional vehicles (e.g. diesel and gas powered trucks) to achieve the higher goal of emission reduction. The total distance travelled by conventional trucks depends on the use of UCC, the demand for which is driven by consumers, and the ordering behaviour of the shopkeepers in terms of order frequency and lot sizing. Of course, the distance travelled also depends on UCC location so UCC should be placed strategically such that truckers can easily access it without driving extra km. (Van Rooijen & Quak, 2010). The scenarios take the shopkeepers’ choices for ordering of deliveries by shops as the main point of intervention for the DCAP policy.====Our main research question is ‘What are the effects of delivery cap and price scenario on UCC use and reduction of carbon emissions?’ In Section 2, a literature review explores the antecedents of our research in three directions: carbon market mechanisms, UCC evaluations and agent based modelling. Section 3 deals with the DCAP policy, explaining the impact mechanisms for the different stakeholders. The next step is devising and analysing a policy based on the carbon market mechanism that can make use of UCC attractive as well as financially independent. Section 4 contains the description of the DCAP policy analysis using the agent based model (ABM) SMUrFS, including a discussion of the results.

Socio-economic, demographic, and travel characteristics were collected using a well-structured questionnaire. To capture the mode shift behavior, perception of travelers (willingness to shift) for different travel cost change scenarios were also recorded. Households were categorized into four income group levels based on the statistical Post-Hoc technique to corroborate the effect of income levels on mode shift behavior. After that, travel demand elasticity analysis was carried out with variation in travel cost using Shrinkage Ratio Technique, to comprehend the sensitivity of travelers in different income groups towards mode choice due to changes in travel cost. The results indicated that the low-income group (LIG) travelers are more sensitive to price change compared to the high income group (HIG) travelers. Subsequently, the shift behavior from the existing private modes to public transport was modeled using Binary Logistic Regression for different income groups, to comprehend the combined effect of monthly income and changes in travel cost on mode shift behavior. It was observed that concerning low-income group (LIG), other three income groups enjoyed higher satisfaction (higher utility) for personalized travel mode at a specific value of travel cost and hence, a lesser shift towards public transportation was observed. Interestingly, identical shift behavior was observed among different income groups for a certain range of travel cost values. Further, sensitivity analyses of the developed mode shift model are performed by considering the changes in In-Vehicle ==== (IVT) and Travel Cost (TC) of present private mode. Indifference curves with travel cost and travel time were then developed based on a non-linear utility function for different income groups.

Urban areas are more affected by adverse effects while remote and less dense areas benefit. These findings show the need for considering cooling in analyses of the effects of grocery home delivery and call for the use of more energy-efficient and less polluting technologies in delivery vehicles for driving and chilling.","The global increase of online shopping has led to a rising number of parcels in freight transport and, therefore, to higher pressure on urban transport. Online grocery shopping==== is very likely fueling arising congestion or air pollution problems, since grocery shopping induces a considerable share of 9% of total urban freight transport (Durand & Gonzalez-Feliu, 2012), which does not even include private shopping trips. Obviously, ordering goods online allows consumers to purchase special products that probably are not available in the stores nearby and this produces more transport. An even higher effect can be expected from changes in daily grocery shopping. Replacing such trips with home deliveries==== is expected to aggravate urban transport problems even more due to the high number of grocery shopping activities. This work focuses on finding out the implications of a change in this type of shopping.====In general, online shopping leads to a shift in the responsibility for the last leg of the transport chain, that is to the home of the customer. This differs for home delivery and the pick-up of goods (Edwards, Halldórsson, McKinnon, & Cullinane, 2010). In the latter case, consumers pick up the goods by themselves either at the store or at some intermediate pick-up point, while in the former case the retailer or an intermediate delivery company transports the goods to the consumer. One might think that private daily shopping trips can thus possibly be replaced by commercial delivery trips, thereby decreasing VKT and CO==== emissions. Recent research has confirmed this, finding that e-groceries have substantially reduced the distances driven (cf. Chapter 2). However, the net effect on transport-related CO==== emissions, when balancing private shopping trips and commercial home deliveries, remains underinvestigated. Furthermore, the transport of groceries such as fresh or frozen food requires cooling==== which is associated with further energy consumption and the production of CO==== emissions. This has not been explicitly considered in recent studies. Thus, another question involves determining the balance of emissions from transport changes once food cooling is included.====In Germany, online grocery shopping is much less developed than in many other countries, with only a market share of 1.1% of total grocery retail sales in 2017 (HDE, 2018). However, this form of retail has shown high growth rates. Furthermore, studies (Ernst & Young, 2017) show that consumers of online groceries live in rather urban contexts where transport is already a problem due to high population density. Thus, the growing city of Berlin, Germany, provides an interesting case for application and analysis. Home delivery can occur both from depots or points of sales (POS). A brief desktop review showed that relevant retail operators with outlets such as 'rewe' deliver from both depots and supermarkets while online-only companies use depots (see Appendix B). For the sake of simplicity and its high relevance for urban mobility we focus on POS-based home delivery in our analyses.====This work therefore pursues the following objectives:====The paper is structured as follows: First, an analysis of recent studies on transport and the environmental effects of online shopping in general as well as of groceries helps us to identify research gaps and derive the requirements and presuppositions for the models. Next, we present the case study and main assumptions for the analysis, before describing the model framework and the prediction and disaggregation of locations, travel demand model, delivery tour planning, and emissions calculation. Subsequently, we set out the separate and combined results for passenger travel demand, including shopping trips and delivery tours, for vehicle kilometers traveled, emissions from driving, and total emissions including those generated by cooling. In this step, we also compare the results for hot and mild air temperatures. Finally, we discuss the results, limitations and future research, policy implications and conclude with our main findings.",Cool but dirty food? – Estimating the impact of grocery home delivery on transport and CO,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302756,20 November 2019,2019,Research Article,187.0

At the same time, urbanization is continuing, as is the need for supply with groceries in cities. Another ongoing trend is the growth of online shopping of groceries.====Increase of online shopping in other areas, e.g. clothing, has resulted in augmented transport demand due to deliveries and returns. Therefore, an approach is needed to uncouple grocery supply related transport demand from emissions augmentation. This is only possible though, if transportation efficiency is further improved and if lower emission technologies (noise and fumes) are applied, e.g. electric vehicles.====With limited data available on urban commercial transport as well as on e-mobility, it is difficult for both logistics providers and politics to prepare for these developments and understand their implications.====Focusing on the German market and using the test case of a renowned logistics service provider who trialed e-vehicles for commercial transport, this paper discusses potential shifts in grocery shopping habits, maps out perspectives, prerequisites and challenges for a shift to electric vehicles for their distribution and derives recommendations for ==== and politics based on the findings.====The data basis of the research is as follows: Whereas the analysis of online grocery shopping had to be based mainly on secondary data, analysis of the potential and prerequisites for the use of electric vehicles for their distribution are based on real-life test cases. This is due to the fact that primary data on commercial transport and on logistics structures of groceries in particular is difficult to obtain in general, and especially in Germany. This is due to the tight data protection in Germany, not allowing to trace employees unless union representatives and employees have agreed. Furthermore, businesses do not want to disclose their logistics structures. The real-life test cases of electric vehicles for grocery deliveries were piloted by Hellmann Worldwide Logistics in Germany and were accompanied by the researchers.

The city of Granada, Spain served as case study. First, a questionnaire was administered with persons older than 55 years, assessing their willingness to reach different types of retail opportunities on foot. A total of 202 valid responses were obtained (171 face-to-face and 31 online): 56% women, average age 69 years old, 20% living alone, and average monthly family income between €1000-€2000. Second, the K-modes clustering algorithm was used to identify four seniors sub-groups: “non-motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “non-motorized seniors older than 75”, and “motorized seniors younger than 65”. The variables used were: age, car availability, household income, and household composition. Third, by using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (p-level <0.05), a comparison of time-willingness functions to walk to retail was made between seniors sub-groups. The results revealed that walking accessibility to groceries are not significantly different among those sub-groups, while the accessibility levels to weekly retail are significantly lower for the “motorized seniors younger than 65” for time-willingness slots of 20–30 min. R software was used for statistical analysis.","The wide access to the Internet is leading an increase of e-grocery shopping, triggering potential threatens for physical stores. While the rate of online groceries purchases is expected to have a rapid growth in upcoming years (González, 2017), there are some population groups with a null or negligible experience with the Internet and e-shopping (Hussain, Ross, & Bednar, 2018, pp. 199–212). The group of seniors is a case in point, considering physical grocery shopping as a social experience integrated in their daily habits. In this respect, physical accessibility to groceries can be crucial for seniors to participate in the social life of their respective communities (Lucas, van Wee, & Maat, 2016).====Under this context, an accessibility planning approach has gained prominence among academics, professionals, and institutions as a key aspect in achieving sustainable planning outcomes at city and regional levels. The shift toward accessibility planning approaches originated in a vast body of academic literature focused on developing the following conceptual and practical innovations: how to estimate accessibility to major destinations, how to map it, how to increase knowledge transfer to practitioners, and how to identify the main effects of accessibility (Arranz-López, Soria-Lara, López-Escolano, & Pueyo-Campos, 2017a; Arranz-López, Soria-Lara, López-Escolano, & Pueyo Campos, 2017b; Geurs & van Wee, 2004; van Wee, 2016; Arranz-López, Soria-Lara, & Pueyo-Campos, 2019).====Accessibility is usually seen as the relationship between the availability of opportunities in a given location and the supply of transportation services to reach them (Bocarejo & Oviedo, 2012), traditionally applied as an absolute variable that equally impacts the full population spectrum. However, people have different perceptions of accessibility levels and as a matter of preference or constraint, different individuals display varying levels of willingness to travel in order to reach opportunities. The result is that accessibility becomes a relative concept that can lead to biased outcomes when considered an absolute parameter of welfare and sustainability (Moniruzzaman, Páez, Nurul Habib, & Morency, 2013; Morency, Paez, Roorda, Mercado, & Farber, 2011; Sultana, Salon, & Kuby, 2017). For this study, relative accessibility is considered as “the proportion of opportunities available to an individual with defined characteristics at a selected location, relative to an individual from a reference group at the same location” (Páez, Gertes Mercado, Farber, Morency, & Roorda, 2010a).====There is a growing number of studies paying attention to how accessibility to major locations can vary depending on socio-economic population groups. Most of consulted studies are focused on the north-American, Canadian, and North-European contexts, but all of them have applicable findings to the case study of this research. A significant example is the studies focused on “food deserts”, analysing accessibility variations associated with ethnicity (Gordon et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2018), socio-economic status (Hendrickson, Smith, & Eikenberry, 2006), and property prices (Helbich, Schadenberg, Hagenauer, & Poelman, 2017). However, the age of individuals has received limited attention as key variable to understand accessibility variations to food stores. Furthermore, the growing ageing population rates in developed countries have spurred concerns regarding seniors' travel patterns and accessibility to other major locations. For example, Ricciardi, Xia, and Currie (2015) explore accessibility levels to public transport systems in the context of Perth, Australia, comparing seniors, low-income populations, populations without car availability, and the rest of the population. The findings reveal that the biggest accessibility differences are found in the seniors group, showing the lowest accessibility level to public transport systems. Similarly, Delbosc and Currie (2011) also analyze accessibility to bus stops in Melbourne, Australia, finding that the low-income population has the lowest accessibility levels followed by seniors. Páez, Nurul, and Morency (2013) demonstrate that car accessibility figures for major destinations are higher for seniors than those observed for other groups in the city of Montreal, Canada. Also in Montreal, Páez, Mercado, Farber, Morency, and Roorda (2010b) find that seniors’ accessibility to health care facilities is significantly lower in suburban areas than in the city center, compared to other population groups in the same location.====While most of the consulted studies focused on the comparison of motorized accessibility levels between seniors and other socio-economic groups, there is a significant research gap related to improving the knowledge about how non-motorized accessibility to groceries can vary between senior citizens (older than 55 years for this research) (Böcker, van Amen, & Helbich, 2017; Cao, Mokhtarian, & Handy, 2010; Hess, 2012; Negron-Poblete, Séguin, & Apparicio, 2016). That is the need for a more in-depth understanding on how and to what extent are seniors able to reach groceries on foot, and the impact of that for policymaking. First, seniors citizens are more dependent than others of public and non-motorized transport modes for covering daily needs (Páez et al., 2010b). Second, despite the considerably growth of e-shopping rates providing an alternative to physical mobility (Kenyon, 2010), it has been demonstrated how the e-shopping rates for older people are very low or non-existent in some contexts (Olsson, Samuelsson, & Viscovi, 2019). Accordingly, improving walking accessibility is seen as essential for achieving decarbonized, livable, and socially inclusive cities (Givoni and Banister, 2013; Tight, 2016; Vale, Saraiva, & Pereira, 2015). The former is even more relevant when considering the UN projections that anticipate 66% of the world's population to live in cities by 2035, with urban populations that have a two-thirds share of persons older than 55 years in developed countries (United Nations, 2014).====Despite the growing interest in the topic, the abovementioned knowledge gap remains. Some reasons underline that. On the one hand, seniors are frequently analyzed in accessibility studies as a homogenous group to be compared with other socio-economic groups (e.g., youngsters and adults). However, some studies have found significant differences within the senior cohort regarding travel behavior and capacity to access certain locations (Alsnih & Hensher, 2003; Hildebrand, 2003). These differences could be amplified even further by the anticipated growth of the senior population at city level. On the other hand, even though it is well-known that the willingness of the senior population to reach retail locations on foot diverges significantly from the willingness of other population groups, it remains a largely unexplored topic in the academic literature (Arranz-López, Soria-Lara, Witlox, & Páez, 2018; Negron-Poblete et al., 2016). Finally, although at least one-third of daily travel among the senior population is on foot (Talavera & Valenzuela, 2017) and despite the well-documented difficulties faced in accessing motorized transport modes (private or collective) (Böcker et al., 2017), studies on walking accessibility that specifically focus on seniors are limited.====To bridge the research gap described, this paper compares whether and to what extent walking accessibility is similar between groceries and other retail types for seniors, as well as seeks to identify time-willingness thresholds that indicate significant shifts in walking accessibility. The city of Granada in Spain was chosen as the location for the case study, due to the fact that it is a compact city with a high share of ageing population and retail locations that are widely dispersed across the city, which reduces travel distances. A questionnaire regarding willingness to reach groceries, weekly, and incidental retail locations on foot was elaborated and administered via face-to-face interviews and online with participants older than 55 years. Then, a k-modes clustering method was implemented, distinguishing four distinct socio-economic sub-groups: “non-motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “motorized seniors between 65 and 75”, “non-motorized seniors older than 75”, and “motorized seniors younger than 65”. It was followed by a statistical comparison of time-willingness decay functions to reach retail locations on foot for each identified sub-group. Finally, walking accessibility to retail activity was estimated and mapped using a gravity-based model.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the case study. Section 3 covers the research design, while Section 4 summarizes the main obtained results. Finally, Section 5 closes the paper with some concluding remarks, including reflections on future research directions.",Comparing walking accessibility variations between groceries and other retail activities for seniors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302574,4 October 2019,2019,Research Article,190.0

Infrastructure investments are a crucial driver of performance in the transport sector. Infrastructure development is effectively able to promote economic growth. Indeed, transport infrastructure is a key element in economic development regardless of income levels. It promotes individual well-being and economic growth, facilitating the generation of reciprocal economic, social, and cultural relations. Failure to address transport problems lessen economic growth process. It has been demonstrated how transport infrastructure gives speed and efficiency to a progress of a community (Polyzos & Tsiotas, 2020).====Infrastructure facilitates trade, powers businesses, joins workers to their jobs, generates new possibilities for areas that are encountering difficulties, and guards a country from a progressively erratic natural environment. It also sustains workers, providing millions of jobs each year in building and maintenance. In few words, infrastructure is the pillar of a healthy economy (OECD, 2020).====Infrastructure makes factors of production more convenient to advanced economies due to the agglomeration effect; however, they can also foster the technological level of production in the adjacent regions thanks to the diffusion effect. Transport infrastructure is an apt setting since conventional economic theory typically considers all infrastructure as an exogenous cost-reducing technological input into the economy, reflected via the proxy of transport costs. Transport infrastructure brings firms closer to a larger customer base and a larger pool of workers, which can stimulate hiring and investment by local firms (Li et al., 2020).====Arguably, the economy needs good infrastructure to link supply chains and effectively shift goods and services from one area to another. Adequate infrastructure system is a clear prerequisite for transport systems. As a matter of fact, appropriate physical connectivity both in the urban and rural areas should be viewed as essential for development process. Successful cities are those able to connect workers to jobs and close the digital divide between high-income and low-income neighborhoods. Congestion decelerates the movement of products; and it also increases prices, dwindling the bottom line. A society that encourages its citizens’ need to be mobile is a cornerstone of resilient nations (Rietveld, 1989).====The indirect effect of infrastructure on economic development is due to several different channels, like the enabling of productive private investment, the generation of new activities (supply chains), or the remodeling of economic geography.====Other infrastructures may be represented by public-private partnerships. These kind of agreements permit a collaboration between public sector and private enterprises, with an active role during the life of the infrastructure asset. In addition, large infrastructural projects ask for buy-in from a vast number of national and regional partners (Liu, 2021). Essentially, these partnerships divide risk and costs of design, construction, maintenance, financing, and operations.====Very often, transport infrastructure expenditures account for a relevant share of countries’ public budget.====Since countries are searching for strategies to recover their economies following the severe recession provoked by COVID-19 pandemic, transport investment undoubtedly represents an opportunity to shift in the direction of sustainable cities (Magazzino, Mele, & Morelli, 2021).====Current megatrends – demographic transition, climate change, digitalization, and automation – are accomplishing additional pressures on transport networks (Magazzino, Mele, Morelli, et al., 2021).====The results of this issue can assist in the difficult decision of the allocation of scarce public funds that policymakers face.====This Special Issue includes 19 papers exploring the link among investments, evaluation and regional economic growth, when dealing with transport infrastructures. The papers come from the 5 continents (Africa, Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe) providing unique and interesting perspectives on the topic.

In fact, the wide-spread digitalization in conjunction with the pervasive/low-cost diffusion of mobile connectivity now empowers consumers to buy online and get the goods delivered at home while they are travelling on the metro or relaxing at the gym after working out. The wealth of data accessible via the digital tracks consumers are leaving behind when navigating the web and purchasing goods online has also made different modelling and representations of these phenomena possible. A noteworthy innovation currently being applied also to urban freight distribution is the digital twin representation of reality that is, whenever correctly developed, capable of improving not only planning decisions but also policy-making definition and policy deployment (Marcucci et al., 2020).====The debate is still hot with respect to the transport-related impacts this might have and the implications regarding congestion, air pollution, accidents, and noise. There is still not a generalised consensus with respect to the comparative costs and benefits that buying online has, compared to buying at the shop. To bridge the gap between the different stakeholder-specific perspectives one can fruitfully adopt well-established planning techniques based upon stakeholders’ involvement in an organised and structured way (Gatta et al., 2019).====With this context in mind, concentrating on digitalized services connected to food in general and with specific attention paid to the grocery's subset, is relevant and important. This is because the strong increase in home deliveries, while improving accessibility to goods, is likely to affect the structure, performance, and carbon footprint of the urban freight chain. Furthermore, the success or the failure of the solutions promoted to foster a more efficient distribution of groceries to final consumers will also, most likely, depend on local transport and land use policies. As the last mile logistic distribution segment is characterised by increasing returns, the outcome will differ across more ==== less densely populated areas/regions.====It is worth investigating the growth of the e-grocery industry which to a large extent will depend on its organization, consumers' preferences for online purchases, and habits (Gatta et al., 2020; Le Pira et al., 2020). In fact, knowledge about consumers’ preferences and habits is important to discover the relevant levers one has to focus on so to stimulate the behavioural change that policymakers are trying to pursue in order to achieve an economic efficient and environmentally sustainable urban freight ecosystem, taking into consideration the heterogeneity pertaining to the various stakeholders involved (Marcucci et al., 2013; Marcucci and Gatta 2014, 2016).====Determining the transport-related consequences linked to these changes is as important as difficult. From different perspectives and using alternative approaches, these are what the papers included in this Special Issue attempt to discuss. Whether this daunting task has been successfully accomplished is up to the reader to decide.====This Special Issue includes 12 papers that were presented at the NECTAR Cluster 2: Policy and Environment workshop titled “E-groceries, digitalization and sustainability: Which governance, planning and regulation mix do our cities need?” held in Molde (Norway) on October 11th and 12th in 2018.","Editorial: E-groceries, digitalization and sustainability",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592100069X,4 June 2021,2021,Research Article,196.0

On one hand there are the evident gaps in transport policy that implement active travel measures as a means of reducing the burden of environmental externalities from the current transport systems. These policies are still today very much centred primarily around the car and the burning of fossil fuels, and are therefore major contributors to climate change (Bache et al., 2014). Indeed, the transport sector is where greenhouse gas emissions (making up 27% of the total emissions in 2018) have increased since 1990 across all of the EU-27, with road transport being responsible for 72% of the total transport emissions in 2018 (European Union, 2020). On the other hand, there are the problems related to health and physical inactivity.====Physical inactivity is linked to several deadly chronic diseases, contributing worldwide to 21.5% of ischemic heart disease, 11% of ischemic stroke, 14% of diabetes, 16% of colon cancer and 10% of breast cancer (Bull et al., 2004). According to the WHO (2020a) the prevalence of obesity tripled since 1975 with at least 2.8 million people dying as a result of being overweight or obese. In addition to this, physical inactivity is responsible for an additional 3.2 million deaths (WHO, 2009). The health concerns extend also to the quality of air. Urban air pollution accounts for circa 3% of mortality from cardiopulmonary diseases and 1% of mortality from acute respiratory infections in children under 5 (Cohen et al., 2005). Moreover, it is estimated that 1.35 million deaths per year result from motor vehicle accidents, with more than half being among vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Road accidents are the leading cause of death among the 5–29 age group (WHO, 2020b).====These, and other considerations have sparked many different policies aiming to promote active forms of transport across a number of cities worldwide. Some urban areas have been more effective than others to adopt active travel policies (Pucher & Buehler, 2008) whilst others are evidently lagging behind in the implementation of both infrastructure and incentives to shift to active travel and reduce car dependence (Maas et al., 2021a). Research also shows that policies aimed at walking and cycling are effective at reducing environmental and health burdens (Aldred, Woodcock, & Goodman, 2021, Brand et al., 2021). Creutzig et al. (2018) show how the electrification of the transport system will not be fast enough, or even sufficient to achieve effective reductions in CO==== emissions. On the other hand, many authors have claimed that investment in active transport infrastructure is a very promising way to reduce transport CO==== emissions (see for example Amelung et al., 2019; Cavallaro et al., 2017; de Nazelle et al., 2010).====The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided ample evidence of the necessary mode shift to reduce CO==== and the effectiveness of active travel to achieve that in urban areas. Air pollution in Italy plummeted in the months of lockdown with studies showing a considerable impact on improved air quality and number of saved lives (Malpede & Percoco, 2020; Malpede et al., 2020). A study in the Netherlands showed that significant changes in travel and behaviour are expected following the pandemic, including an increase in the use of active travel modes (de Haas et al., 2020).====It is therefore evident that more research is required to support the development and implementation of policies that promote healthier active travel in order to improve urban environments but also well-being. The traditional focus on cycling is expanding to include more research into walking and including concepts of walkability in cities (Cañas et al., 2020). However, much of the research is very focused on many developed cities, with little to nothing known about cities in the Global South, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The efforts of T-SUM (====) will hopefully shed more light on these issues in these regions.====This Special Issue collects a number of papers related to active travel and provides for some interesting perspectives on planning and policies, issues related to later life and road accidents, mode choice, and cases specifically dealing with bicycle use and walking. In all it presents 12 papers from a variety of geographies and scales. Some of these papers are outputs of a NECTAR event which was jointly organised by Cluster 2: Policy and Environment and Cluster 7: Social and Health Issues.

First, we use an ","Since the seminal work of Williamson (1968), economic analysis emphasizes market power and productive efficiency as the primary drivers of mergers. Under the market power hypothesis, a higher price and lower output level reduce consumer surplus. Part of the reduction is a transfer from consumers to the merging firms in the form of higher firms' profits and part is a loss of consumer surplus from a higher post-merger price that reduces the quantity of the goods demanded. In the case of the productive efficiency hypotheses, a lower average cost leads to a greater profit for a given output level. Understanding sources of a merger's effects is critical for evaluating mergers and for developing effective and appropriate regulatory policies. An efficiency-enhancing merger that reduces production costs but increases market power could have a net beneficial effect for consumers if the efficiency-induced cost savings offset the allocative inefficiency. Further, such efficiency enhancing mergers would be subject to less antitrust scrutiny.====This paper adopts Williamson's framework to analyze the horizontal merger between China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines in 2009. This case study is of interest for three reasons. First, there is an on-going discussion of airline mergers in the literature. Zhang et al., 2014 discuss market power in the Chinese airlines industry which from Ma et al., 2020 likely increases in a post-merger environment. Yet Yan et al. (2019) reports a productivity gain from mergers in the Chinese airline industry. Given this mixed evidence, developing an analytic framework to evaluate the overall impact of mergers is important for informing policy makers and public policy. Second, airline mergers in China are part of a broader policy of industry deregulation. As the second largest aviation market in terms of available seats, understanding the effects of airline mergers in China is of policy interest for its domestic and international markets.==== Although there was a wave of airline mergers in 2000s, the China Eastern and Shanghai Airline merger provides an excellent case study for our empirical analysis because the appropriate data are available, i.e. stock prices and operating statistics and because several studies, including Zhang (2015), Ma et al. (2020) and Ho et al. (2020), have studied this merger.==== These studies will provide a check on whether our empirical results are reasonable and consistent.====Since Eckbo (1983), there have been empirical studies applying an event study methodology to examine the competitive effects of mergers. In particular, these studies aim to test the relative strength of the market power and productive efficiency hypotheses. In this class of models, the null hypothesis is that there is no abnormal return on competitors of the merging firms in response to the merger announcement, which suggests an indeterminacy of relative strength of those two hypotheses. The alternative hypothesis is that a positive (negative) reaction on competitors’ stock is evidence that the market power (productive efficiency) effect dominates.====Although both market power and productive efficiency are likely to play a role in driving the shareholders' valuation gain of a merger, an event study is silent in showing how much of the valuation gain reflects market power and how much reflects productive efficiency. This paper proposes a decomposition analysis quantifying the relative importance of these two effects for airline mergers. First, we use the event study to estimate the wealth effect, which is a composite effect of market power and productive efficiency, of an airline merger. Second, we use the operating statistics to compute the cost saving from the merger, which is the part attributed to productive efficiency. Finally, we use the difference between estimated wealth effect and cost saving to be the part attributed to market power. We apply our model to a case study of the horizontal merger between China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines in 2009. Our results find that the productive efficiency contributed nearly four-fifths to the merged airline's increased market valuation, while increased market power contributed about one-fifth of the total increase.====Our paper contributes to the event study literature for examining the effects of an airline merger. Knapp (1990) conducts an event study for nine airline mergers proposed in 1986, in which positive abnormal returns for both merging airlines and rival portfolios support the market power hypothesis. Singal (1996) examines 27 airline mergers during 1985–88 and finds support for the market power hypothesis. Using data on the 1986 Northwest-Republic Airlines merger, Hergott (1997) event study finds a rise in market power of the merging airlines through increasing concentration at the airport level. Zhang and Aldridge (1997), which examines the potential merger between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International for the period 1992–93, do not find any impact on US airlines. Flouris and Swidler (2004) finds that the acquisition of Trans World Airlines by American Airlines in 2001 had negative impacts on American Airlines shareholders. However, none of these studies explores the relative strength of market power and productive efficiency effects. In a companion paper, Ho et al. (2020) examines the sources of gain from merger between China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines. Relying on data from domestic competitors, international competitors and airports, among their results, the authors find that the merged airline gains market power in the domestic market and efficiency improvements in international markets. The study does not, however, examine the extent to which market power and efficiency improvements, respectively, contribute to the increased wealth of the merging firms. This paper extends the results of Ho et al. (2020) by proposing a decomposition methodology that enables us to calculate the proportion of the merger's total wealth effect due to market power and productive efficiency, respectively.====Section 2 present our decomposition methodology.

However, scant research exists on paratransit system riders' barriers and opportunities to adopt on-demand micro-transit service as an alternative mobility option. This study focused on the identification of potential barriers and system benefits for switched users from paratransit to on-demand micro transit. Face to face and telephone interview surveys were conducted with 128 paratransit users in the city of Arlington, Texas to identify potential barriers towards accepting on-demand micro-transit. Secondary data analysis was performed on the city's real-time paratransit database. The survey results showed that 15% of the respondents reported lack of spatial coverage, 13% indicated lack of walking access, and 18% specified difficulty in use as potential barriers in the path of adopting on-demand micro-transit. Although the overall adoption of Via by current paratransit users remains low, the secondary data analysis indicated that riders who are not disabled, without an assistive device, and older (age>54) who have frequent healthcare and discretionary trips are willing to adopt on-demand micro-transit (Via) service. This paper will provide transit authorities a better understanding of the needs of on-demand micro-transit users and the potential benefits of providing micro-transit service.","Paratransit services provide a mobility option for persons with disabilities and older adults who may not be able to access all of their activities using other transportation modes such as automobile, walking, and fixed-route transit. These services provide flexible scheduling and routing to accommodate the specific needs of transportation disadvantaged populations; however, most of these services require at least a day in advance scheduling.====Demand for paratransit continues to grow in the United States (U.S.). The population aged 65 and older increased 33% from 2006 (37.2 million) to 2016 (49.2 million), and is projected to double by 2060 (98 million) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018, pp. 1–20). This growth represents a potential financial and quality of service burden to current and future operations. According to the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, paratransit systems represent a crucial strategy for providing mobility to these transportation disadvantaged populations. However, the increasing population leads to continuing annual growth in paratransit system expenses. Many paratransit systems require significant financial outlays to serve large numbers of the population. For example, the New York City paratransit system serves 144,000 customers at $456 million per year, while the Chicago system serves 50,000 subscribers at $137 million per year and the Boston system serves 80,000 subscribers at $75 million per year (Kaufman et al., 2016). San Mateo County, California, provides paratransit service to 8500 registered customers. This service costs more than $18 million a year that represents 12% of the agency's operating cost (Gee & Kersteen-tucker, 2017). These examples demonstrate a range of costs per subscriber for these services and indicate their large operating costs, which appear poised to increase with increasing demand/need.====Many U.S. cities have launched private or public-private partnership (PPP) pilot projects involving on-demand micro-transit service, including Chariot in San Francisco, Bridj in Boston and Washington, and Via in New York City and Arlington, Texas. Micro-transit is a form of Demand Responsive Transit (DRT) for shared-used transportation services using dynamically generated routes (====). DRT is a combination of affordable public transit services and personalized (single occupancy) taxi services with flexible routes and schedules (====). DRT operates a minibus for shared ride transport and responds to passenger demand at flexible pick up and drop off points using optimized routes. It provides curb-to-curb or door-to-door mobility in major metropolitan areas and surrounding suburbs as well as small cities and rural communities to fill the gaps in the fixed route system. It may be viewed as an extension of regular transportation service as many public transportation departments collaborate with private agencies to provide this service as first- and last-mile options for fixed transit systems. Direct trip service of micro-transit could also significantly reduce travel time for transit users who need a transfer to complete a trip (Doug Kaufman, 2018).====On-demand micro-transit provides shared rides to all. Therefore, they can accommodate older adults and riders with a disability. The popularity of micro-transit hinges on its increased mobility over public transit for paratransit users. This is because micro-transit improves the flexibility of current paratransit operations by allowing users to request service in real-time through a smartphone application, which instructs a vehicle to deviate from its current route to pick up the customer. Micro-transit can also possibly reduce more expensive ADA paratransit trips to save agency resources because it is cheaper per trip than paratransit but more expensive per trip than fixed-route transit (Volinski, 2019). Moreover, micro-transit may perform better in lower-density environments and provide a viable alternative to expensive ADA paratransit, while increasing the mobility of the transportation disadvantaged populations currently served by the ADA paratransit.====Future transportation systems should be synchronized between Mobility-on-demand (MOD) such as car sharing, bike sharing, ride-hailing (e.g., Uber and Lyft), micro-transit (e.g., Bridj, Chariot, and Via) and public mass transit (train and bus). MOD will cover low-density areas and first/last mile service gaps while public mass transit will cover high demand corridors (Mahéo et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Stiglic et al., 2018; Yan, Levine, & Zhao, 2019). A Michigan-based survey has shown that mobility-on-demand is strongly preferred by disadvantaged travelers over existing fixed routes due to enhanced transit accessibility to different destinations despite their concerns about the high fare and technological barriers to reserve a ride (Yan, 2019a, Yan et al., 2019b).====Many cities are using on-demand micro-transit as an alternative mode of transportation for fixed routes during a crisis such as a pandemic. For example, in May 2020, the City of Columbus, OH, launched on-demand micro-transit (Via) in Grove City, OH, to provide further access to jobs, healthcare, and a faster, convenient, and comfortable transit solution during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Los Angeles, CA, micro-transit firm provided point-to-point services as of April 2020 within a specific area to ensure transportation. In April 2020, the Denton County Transportation Authority of Texas expanded its micro-transit to replace fixed-route bus services. In March 2020, the St. Louis, MO, area started to integrate micro-transit with other micro-mobility options. Finally, the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) of Albany, NY, launched FLEX in January 2020 as an on-demand micro-transit pilot to provide curb-to-curb service through flexible routing and scheduling.

The e-scooter represents one of several innovative modes that have emerged to cater for transportation needs in urban areas. They provide connectivity linking local origins and destinations, as well as interconnectivity linking urban locations to inter-urban networks. These vehicles are marketed as a micro form of public transportation designed to meet the needs of fit and able people wishing to make trips of two miles or less. They are touted as part of “micromobility” complementing existing transportation networks. This paper reviews the gray and limited academic economic literature looking at the viability and economics of e-scooters within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate in US cities. It considers the ways regulatory structures are evolving as the authorities learn of the attributes and limitations of the mode. In doing this, the paper also makes comparisons with some of the other “novel” forms of local transportation that have emerged, including those offered by transportation network companies. The paper focuses on the pre-Covid-19 period.","While the professional journals and the informed press have invested a lot of time looking at the economic prospects and implications of e-scooters, the study of the mode in the core economic journals has been piecemeal and mainly of the case-study variety.==== This is not surprising, the introduction of this micromobility mode is recent, although the speed of its uptake has been exponential in many places.====This paper pulls together the insights that have been obtained regarding the economics of e-scooter markets. It also considers the political-economy of the regulatory approaches urban authorities in the US have adopted to steer the market in e-scooters. To do this, it sets out an ==== making use of both what is to be found in the mainstream academic journals (often parochially called “the literature”) and in the “gray literature” (reports, professional journals, serious newspapers, Web contributions, etc.). It outlines and critiques some of the ideas that have been advanced regarding the types of markets e-scooters serve and the managerial economic models that suppliers have sought to adopt. This then forms a basis for considering the economic rationale for market interventions, the forms these interventions have taken, and, where possible, their short-run outcomes.====As noted, a variety of sources are used that extend beyond the narrower confines of most of the contemporary economic literature. Lack of traditional refereeing and incomplete reporting suggests that much of the material found, for example, on the Web and in some professional journals has been less rigorously assessed than that in peer reviewed academic articles or official reports.==== In many cases there is also advocatory.

Focusing on the dimensions of competition, ownership and authorisation, we identify five distinct regulatory regimes: public ","Growing transport demand in developing countries, rising environmental concerns in industrialised ones and growing institutional maturity in transitional economies shape public transport debates in different ways. A particular stage of economic development imposes different constraints on policy makers' choice of the most efficient regulatory regime for public transport, being a social necessity for everyone. In the ‘age of regulation’, in most developed countries, such as Western European, Offshoots of the West and Japan, transport services were dealt with through public enterprises. In the US, however, they were the primary targets for natural monopoly regulation. In theory, ‘when technical conditions make a monopoly the natural outcome of competitive market forces, there are only three alternatives that seem available: private monopoly, public monopoly, or public regulation. All three are bad, so we must choose among evils … The choice between the evils of private monopoly, public monopoly, and public regulation cannot, however, be made once and for all, independently of the factual circumstances.’ (Friedman, 2009, p. 29).====In practice, perfect regulation is virtually impossible, while financial and technological circumstances are changeable. Admitting the inherited problems of informational asymmetries and the non-benevolence of regulators, policy makers have implemented deregulation policies in public transport throughout the world with varying degrees of success. The academic world responded with the ‘new regulatory economics’ (Laffont & Tirole, 1993) and the ‘new political economy of regulation’ (Benoît, 2019), but the gap between the theory and the evidence for it remains a weakness of the existing literature on public transport reforms.====Our paper aims at shrinking the gap between the research and practice by analysing competition and ownership dimensions in the theoretical model of deregulation. These issues are central to Thredbo conference discussions on land passenger transport reforms, summarised by (Wong & Hensher, 2018). Following the new regulatory economics tradition, we consider the forth ‘evil’, particularly the model of contracting out by (Auriol & Picard, 2009b), and the fifth one, namely laissez faire competition in a deregulated and fragmented public transport sector, which we model explicitly in the theoretical section of the paper. Our contribution offers a complementary but novel view on the relationship between the four regulatory regimes analysed in (Auriol & Picard, 2009b), because it integrates a ‘deregulation regime’ as an outside option for policy makers. Thus, we provide a theoretical background to the comparison of ‘competition in the market’ vs. ‘competition for the market’ alternatives, discussed in (Merkert et al., 2018).====Deregulation in public transport contains three principal dimensions: price liberalisation, subsidy reduction and privatisation (Beesley, 1991). In UK bus services in the 1980s, the immediate effect was a reduction in costs per vehicle mile and a downward shift in the operator's vehicle size, leading to the emergence of minibuses. In developing and transitional economies the replacement of public by private sector operations has led to even greater reduction in average vehicle size and an increase in fares. (Gwilliam, 2001) (Gwilliam, 2000b, Gwilliam, 2000a) also argues that the scope of competition is not linked to ownership. For instance, in the Russian Federation in 1990s, decentralisation and the withdrawal of federal subsidies gave rise to a market initiative in the bus sector, regardless of whether ownership was public or private. In many Russian cities, the authorities established separate bus parks that operated largely independently.====Competition in the market between informal sector operators emerged in many developing countries spontaneously rather than by ‘the design of a conscious act of deregulation’ (Gwilliam, 2001). Safety problems, reliability and accessibility of privately delivered services, together with the market cartelisation (eg. in Santiago, see (Koprich, 1994)) and monopolisation brought about an inefficient allocation of resources. These drawbacks of unregulated markets were addressed by the governments either in the form of a return to public monopoly, like in Kuala Lumpur (Gwilliam, 2001), or in the form of competition for the market, like in Moscow. In 2010s, the Moscow authorities drove out the old minibuses, reintroduced tougher regulation and formalised tendering and direct award procedures for granting operating rights to private companies (Ryzhkov, 2018).====Deregulation often leads to transport market fragmentation. Minibus, marshrutka, dolmuş, matatu, bush taxi, dollar van, tro tro, collectivo, tut-tuk and their cognates serve millions of users daily, primarily but not exclusively in the developing world (Sgibnev & Vozyanov, 2016). The ‘small vehicle’ argument is important to understand the competition/regulation dichotomy which is associated with the cost-control debate. The case of deregulation when entry barriers are reduced due to smaller investment requirements has not been properly addressed in the regulatory literature yet. The reason is that the prevailing production technology with high fixed cost usually makes a new entry unprofitable.====We capture the well documented ‘minibus’ delivery solution in a deregulated public transport market by relaxing the assumption of prohibitively high investment requirements to start operations. Market fragmentation can occur through splitting the required transport production capacity between competing rivals. The notion of fixed costs may not only refer to vehicles alone, but equally to ancillary facilities (e.g. maintenance depots). We model ‘competition in the market’ regime as a Cournot oligopoly in the deregulated and fragmented public transport market, the structure of which is not designed ex ante. Our asymmetric information modelling framework enables direct pairwise comparisons of the social welfare values for all five regulatory regimes: 1) public monopoly, 2) regulated private monopoly, 3) unregulated private monopoly, 4) outsourcing or competition for the market, and 5) on-road or competition in the market.====The policy relevant question of whether deregulation is preferable to regulation is addressed in the following way. We map the sensitivities of the respective social welfare differentials to the following exogenous parameters: the marginal and the fixed costs of production, the social cost of public funds, and the ability to extract monopoly rents via efficient tendering mechanisms and corresponding franchise fees.====Our formal analysis is shaped by the concept of ‘regulatory cycle’ articulated by (Gwilliam, 2008) for the bus sector. It implies that a historical change of the industry's organisational structures and regulatory regimes follows a cyclical path and does not evolve to a once and for all preferable solution. This concept has been widely discussed in the transportation literature (Wilkinson, 2010). Our paper demonstrates, that the existence of a regulatory cycle cannot be excluded from the theoretical point of view, but we also suggest the theoretical arguments for policy reversals.====To develop these arguments, we organise the paper as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on conceptual models of public transport, including (Gwilliam, 2008) concept of regulatory cycle, and relates it to the modelling framework of the new regulatory economics. We build a model of deregulation and fragmentation in a public transport sector in Section 3 and present the closed form solutions for five alternative regulatory regimes. In Section 4 we compute the effects of technological, fiscal and institutional parameters on the welfare differentials and formulate our theoretical propositions. Section 5 discusses the main applications and implications of the theory and interprets the five alternatives as phases of the regulatory cycle and explores the main driving forces of the regulatory cycle in public transport. Section 6 concludes.

The increasing number of larger vessels traversing the expanded canal increases the number of containers for relatively large ports in the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Our results reveal that the expansion of the canal increased import volumes by an average of 24.2%, compared to ports in the Pacific Coast. Various robustness checks reduce our estimations, but they remain statistically significant.","The Panama Canal expansion finished in 2016, and it was one of the largest construction projects in the world (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2013). The expansion involved constructing of a third set of locks, excavating a new access channel (Pacific Access Channel), widening and deepening the Gatun Lake navigational channel, deepening of Culebra Cut, and raising the Gatun Lake maximum operational level (Autoridad del Canal de Panamá, 2016).====According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) (2018), the original Panama Canal locks are only able to fit Panamax vessels—ships with a length of 965 ft. (294.13 m), width of 106 ft. (32.31 m), and draught of 40 ft. (12.19 m). In terms of twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), the Panamax can carry up to 5000 TEUs. The expansion enabled the passage of larger vessels like the Neopanamax, which can carry up to 14,500 TEUs and is approximately 25% longer, 52% wider, and 26% deeper than the Panamax. Table 1 compares different vessels by their size and the port infrastructure needed to service them.====The Panama Canal Authority (2018a) reports that the number of ships of Neopanamax size and above traversing the canal increased after the expansion. Table 2 displays monthly traffic data for the Panama Canal from July 2014 to July 2018, and it shows a steady increase in the percentage of ships of at least Neopanamax size crossing the canal. Column (3) shows that 59 of these ships traversed the canal a month after its expansion, which represent 6.24% of the total number of ships crossing the canal in July 2016. Columns (4) and (5) show that the monthly traffic of these larger ships increased to 16.03% and 23.35% in July 2017 and July 2018, respectively.====An increasing number of larger ships like the Neopanamax crossing the canal implies a larger number of containers going through the canal. We expect this increase in incoming containers to particularly affect relatively large ports in the Gulf and Atlantic coasts in relation to similar ports in the Pacific Coast. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) of the U.S. Department of Transportation provides historical data on yearly total import volumes measured in container TEUs for major U.S. container ports (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2018). We use these data to compute import volume growth rates for U.S. ports in the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts. Fig. 1 shows these growth rates and confirms that the import volumes of ports in the Gulf and Atlantic grew at a higher rate after the 2016 expansion, in relation to ports in the Pacific.====The increase in incoming container volume highlighted in Fig. 1 poses challenges for ports in the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. To remain competitive, these ports need to invest in their capacity to accommodate the higher number of Neopanamax vessels passing through the canal and avoid long queues (Lang & Veenstra, 2010). For instance, Bonney (2016) reported that the Port of New York-New Jersey and the Port of Virginia faced congestion when groups of larger ships arrive off schedule.====Previous studies on the impact of the canal expansion are preemptive, mainly qualitative, or limited due to not having much post-expansion data. For example, MARAD (2013) predicted potential impacts on U.S. imports coming from Northeast Asia. These impacts include a potential shift of incoming containerized cargo from the Pacific Coast to the Gulf and Atlantic costs due to a reduction in transportation costs. Industry consultants and real estate developers agreed with this prediction (Bonney, 2016). Moreover, Chu et al. (2017) predicted that the expansion of the canal may particularly benefit the liquified natural gas and liquified petroleum gas industries. However, their research is constrained to not having much data after expansion was completed. Furthermore, Prozzi and Overmyer (2018) used traffic data from 2015 to 2016 to estimate potential effects of the expansion on transits and cargo weight. They found that the expansion increased the traffic of tankers, but decreased the transit of container ships in the Asian-North American trade routes. However, they acknowledge that the expanded canal was only open for 6 months in 2016 and that data from 2017 will provide a more accurate picture of the effects of the expansion.====The aim of this research is to examine whether and how the expansion of the canal affected the import volumes of container ports in the Gulf and Atlantic coasts relative to ports in the Pacific Coast. Specifically, we explore the possibility that the greater traffic of larger vessels (a result of the expansion) increases the import volumes of ports in the Gulf and Atlantic that are able to accommodate them (relative to similar ports in the Pacific). This paper contributes to literature regarding the expansion of the Panama Canal in three ways. First, it provides a preliminary analysis of the effect of the canal expansion using the most current public data available at the time of this study. Second, it adds empirical evidence on how the expansion of the canal increased the import volumes of relatively large ports in the Gulf and Atlantic regions of the U.S. Third, it gives insight supporting investments in port capacity to handle larger amounts of incoming containerized cargo more efficiently.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief review of the literature, followed by Section 3 which discusses the data. Section 4 provides an outline of our model specification, and Section 5 presents our results. Finally, Section 6 concludes with key takeaways from our analysis and results.",A preliminary analysis of U.S. import volumes and regional effects associated with the Panama Canal expansion,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301670,1 October 2020,2020,Research Article,207.0

The purpose of this study is to assess the socio-economic effects of the AALRT on communities around the system. Six stations were systematically selected on East-West line, and random sampling was used to collect survey data from residents living within a 1 km radius from each of the selected stations. ","The introduction of light rail transit can affect existing community along the route and around the station in both positive and negative ways. The positive impacts of light rail transit include strengthening the development of the existing neighborhoods, rejuvenating declined areas and attracting new clusters of development around stations (Cervero, 1984). There are also unintended negative impacts of light rail transit on adjacent communities such as noise pollution, increasing crime rate and nuisance effects (Bowes & Ihlanfeldt, 2001). The earliest international study about the impact of rail public transport on urban areas was by Hall and Hass-Klau (1985). The project focused on the impact of light rail and underground urban and suburban rail on the economic vitality of city centers in 15 cities (8 German and 7 British). The study concluded that transit investments facilitate urban change and must be planned in the context of the city's general condition. According to Babalik (2000), there is a relationship between public transport and land use change in different countries. In addition, Wringley and Wyatt (2001) suggested the relationship between transport infrastructures, land use changes and urban developments. According to their theory, new transport infrastructure can affect property development and land use, business/job opportunities and the image of the city. Thus, those changes can attract developers, investors, companies and households/individuals, all of which can bring additional development to the area.====This study investigates the positive and negative effects of the Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AALRT) on adjacent communities. AALRT was the first metro rail system in Sub-Saharan Africa and was built by the Chinese government (Ethiopian Railway Corporation, 2009). Since it was a new infrastructure in the region, to date there has been no research conducted related to the socio-economic impacts of the LRT. The AALRT was thought to bring both positive and negative changes to adjacent communities in terms of the social and economic conditions. The positive impacts of the LRT on the adjacent residential communities were identified in previous studies as travel time reduction (Weinstock et al., 2011), travel distance (coverage) increase (Vanderschuren & Hitge, 2015), transport cost reduction (Hensher & King, 1998) and increasing population density around the LRT stations (Davis, 2008; David et al., 2015). Previous research has revealed that the major negative impact is the segregation of adjacent neighborhoods (Haque, 2016; Shen, 2013). However, for the AALRT, a detailed investigation is needed, as there has been no research conducted that focused on socio-economic impacts, especially on adjacent residential communities. Therefore, the overall purpose of the study is to assess the impacts of the LRT system on communities surrounding the light rail transit using various socio-economic indicators.",Social and economic impacts of public transportation on adjacent communities: The case of the Addis Ababa light rail transit,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301682,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,208.0

In late 2017, the government lifted this moratorium which enabled the Gauteng Provincial Government to design a service for a number of operating areas, one of which was for the Mamelodi township to the east of Pretoria.From the outset, some operators expressed their reservations about the quality of the supporting information, especially the lack of detailed passenger and route information, and the lack of an escalation formula for the seven year contract. Bidders viewed these aspects as major cost risks that made it difficult to determine a competitive price for the service.The purpose of the research is to investigate how bidding companies viewed the Mamelodi contract when tendering for the service and to compare the results of the bidding process amongst the respective bidders. To achieve this objective a single case study strategy was followed. Use was made of a structured questionnaire to interview the bidding companies, documentary analysis such as the detailed specifications of the Mamelodi contract as well as obtaining financial and operating information from the bidding companies that could serve as a basis of comparison on how the companies responded to the tender requirements. These sources of information were triangulated to arrive at observations and conclusions.The results of the research indicated that there were major variances in annual passenger trip estimates, passenger revenue estimates, subsidy requirements and overall tender amounts, amongst the bidders. This is mainly as a result of incomplete passenger information and a lack of detailed route information, the lack of an adequate escalation formula and a requirement that bidders had to sub-contract 30% of their services to smaller operators. The higher costs for the service, compared to the cost of the incumbent operator, resulted in the tender not being awarded.Recommendations are that contracting authorities ought to supply as much information as possible in the design of public transport contracts in order to receive truly cost competitive bids. This ought to include detailed passenger numbers and related passenger fares (to determine overall revenue) and detailed route and network kilometres so that the bidders can determine their operating costs. In addition, contracts ought to include adequate escalation formulae (especially the correct weighting of cost elements) and where there are special requirements, such as sub-contracting of services, that such requirements can be reasonably executed by bidders.","Public transport contracting has been growing throughout the world as a means to increase service efficiencies, holding operators to account for service deliveries and to improve operating and funding efficiencies. This trend is evident when considering the long history of especially the biennial international THREDBO conference series on competition and ownership issues in land passenger transport (Wong & Hensher, 2017). The topics of this conference series typically focus on contracting in public transport, service design, contracting results and trends in many jurisdictions throughout the world (See Stanley and van de Velde (2008) on risk and reward in public transport services; (Stanley & Longva, 2010) on contract design; Van de Velde (1997) on entrepreneurship and tendering in local public transport services; Hensher (2014) on land passenger transport reforms and Bray et al. (2017) on a 30 year review of papers and reflections of the THREDBO conference series).====However, there is a general lack of research on how bidders evaluate contracts (the bidder's view of contract characteristics). This is especially prevalent in public transit contracts as the lack of published information was very evident when researching the topic for this paper. This lack of information is also evident from the vast suppository of papers read at, amongst other, the seminal THREDBO series of conferences on competition and ownership issues in public transport over the years. The way bidders view tender documentation specifications and characteristics (risk and reward in the broader sense) is critical for authorities to understand in order to attract real competitive bids.====The lack of information about bidder behaviour in competitively tendered public transit contracts presented an opportunity for research in the Mamelodi contract in Pretoria, South Africa, as it was the first public transit contract to be put out to tender in about 17 years in South Africa. The choice of the Mamelodi contract was also informed by the results of the respective bids that pointed to a significant increase between the incumbent operator's subsidy requirement and that submitted by most of the bidding companies. In the view of many of the bidding companies the Gauteng province's Mamelodi (net cost) contract was problematic as it was incomplete regarding passenger and route data and also did not include an escalation formula. In addition, the contract was put out to tender over the Christmas holiday period making it near impossible for potential bidders to verify passenger and route data as most businesses had closed for the summer holidays in South Africa.====The primary research objective was therefore to investigate how the bidding companies viewed the Mamelodi contract characteristics when tendering for the service and to contribute to this under-research area of competitive public transit tendering, not only in South Africa but throughout the world. Secondary objectives included an analysis of the various bids with a view to understand how the bidders arrived at their respective bid prices, to determine what risks the bidders took into account when bidding for the service and to make recommendations for future contract designs, based on the findings of the study.====In undertaking this research a single case study strategy was followed as it allowed for the research topic to be studied within its context – the Mamelodi contract. A case study normally allows for a detailed understanding of the context of the research by using quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect information. In this regard, use was made of a structured questionnaire to interview the bidding companies, documentary analysis such as the detailed specifications of the Mamelodi contract as well as obtaining financial and operating information from the bidding companies that could serve as a basis of comparison on how the companies responded to the tender requirements. These sources of information were triangulated to arrive at observations and conclusions.====This contract is viewed as the critical case as the purpose of the research was to determine how bidding companies viewed the characteristics embedded in the contract when they prepared their bids. It is further believed that these findings and recommendations could very well be applicable to any public transit contract as the basic business principles embodied in contract design and evaluation (by bidders) are more or less universal throughout the world, but bearing in mind local contexts.",Understanding bidder behaviour: The case of the Mamelodi contract,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592030161X,28 September 2020,2020,Research Article,209.0

Supply side considerations are reviewed before turning to the potential ways for mitigating identified gaps in the requirements of prioritised areas, with particular reference to new models of transport service provision, technological solutions, and various modal and multi-modal solutions. The findings show that more flexible and integrated public transport solutions are being explored by cities, regions and service providers to address the constraints of more conventional models. Flexibility in such services is in the form of geographic, temporal, or vehicle flexibility. These are complemented by the opinion of experts as to the way forward for providing more tailored services for vulnerable users. Despite challenges, the paper identifies some promising service options for travellers in both rural and ====; however, any successful service must be underpinned by a robust, multi-modal transport network in order for that promise to be realised.","Identification of transport users who are ‘vulnerable to exclusion’ is not a simple prospect. Myriad factors impact upon how well different groups of travellers are served by transport networks, including those associated with the person themselves, contextual factors such as the geographic and economic environment, and the existing multi-modal transport system. Compounding these influences are spatial and temporal dimensions of service, with particular considerations around how effectively the transport system is able to match users with their preferred destinations at times that are appropriate for undertaking desired activities.====In this paper, we draw on work completed as part of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 INCLUSION (Towards more accessIble and iNCLUSIve mObility solutions for EuropeaN prioritised areas) project to reflect on the challenges and opportunities associated with providing adequate and efficient transport services for vulnerable populations and areas, which we term “prioritised areas”. In Section 2 we provide an extensive literature review to describe such areas with reference to area types; user segments; mobility options; transport infrastructure and service provision; key societal trends affecting mobility and accessibility (including first and last mile connectivity); inclusivity and equity; and the impacts (potential or experienced) of such trends on vulnerable users. This is complemented by a review of supply-side considerations in Section 3.====In Section 4, we use identified characteristics along with consideration of known practical concerns expressed by transport providers, authorities and agencies to identify a set of 15 “prioritised area” types that are representative of the multi-dimensional nature of vulnerability in transport. Of note is that these areas are designed to represent a mix of geographies and population types; in addition to representing the multi-dimensional influences of mobility access, equity, and provision. They are intended to demonstrate the complexities inherent in planning for effective transport services across heterogeneous populations and geographic areas. The requirements of prioritised areas are then aligned with an overview of potential ways for addressing or mitigating identified gaps with reference to new models of transport service provision and the additional incorporation of a range of technological levels and solutions. In this context we consider different modal and multi-modal solutions including demand responsive and flexible transport services and other shared transport solutions, improved passenger information, potential first- and last-mile solutions, and various aspects of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). The review considers how multimodal, as compared to unimodal, solutions have provided opportunities in their application. This review is complemented, in Section 5, with a review of expert opinions that add further context to identified considerations and suggest additional requirements for effective service provision.====The overall objective of the paper is to demonstrate the complexities associated with provision of effective transport services to the ‘mobility poor’, as well as identifying potential methods, and the relevance of multimodal solutions, to overcome these challenges. This objective is achieved via discussion of findings from the reviewed literature and expert input and examples of good practice, as well as an assessment of the suitability of different mobility interventions for addressing these challenges.",Can multi-modal integration provide enhanced public transport service provision to address the needs of vulnerable populations?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301529,24 September 2020,2020,Research Article,210.0

This is a major concern for waste collection in Pakistan where waste collection routes are left to the discretion of drivers, resulting in many of the waste management agencies involved in municipal waste in Pakistan incurring high costs for waste collection and transportation (Population Reference Bureau, 2009). In addition to the costs associated with inefficient waste management, inadequate waste collection negatively impacts the environment, leading to serious health, financial, and socio-environmental issues (Adila & Chaudhry, 2009; Mahar et al., 2007). In most of the urban cities of Pakistan poor collection and transportation of municipal solid waste is reported. In Pakistan, numerous government owned and privately operated service companies are responsible for the collection of solid waste. They currently collect only 50 percent of the total waste generated (ESMAP, 2010). However, for the country to be clean, at least 75% of waste should be collected (Daskalopoulos & Badr, 1997; Şener et al., 2006). To address these issues in other parts of the world, urban planners have turned to geographic information systems (GIS) for route selection and optimization in the collection process (Narayan, 1999). The use of GIS aids decision makers to manipulate data in order to generate options and to make efficient and effective decisions (Tavares et al., 2009). Therefore, cost sensitive urban planners can use GIS technology to cut costs and improve collection (Karadimas et al., 2009).====The objective of this study is to apply vehicle routing problem (VRP) techniques using GIS to select routes for collection of residential waste so as to minimize the travel distance, and correspondingly the time and cost of the collection process. In Pakistan, no city has a proper solid waste management system starting from solid waste collection up to proper final dumping. This study proposes a methodology in Pakistan as no one has yet utilized VRP techniques and GIS tools to optimize routes for solid waste management for the twin cities in Pakistan. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive research on vehicle routing solutions for waste management in Pakistan. Furthermore, as the methodology is shown to accommodate a variety of practical rules such as zone constraints, vehicle capacities, time windows, road infrastructure, and commodity type, other cities and urban areas in developing countries could adopt the methodology to optimize collection routing.",Effective municipal solid waste collection using geospatial information systems for transportation: A case study of two metropolitan cities in Pakistan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301487,23 September 2020,2020,Research Article,211.0

Several studies have tested models with different subjective variables to investigate their effects on travel behaviour. Understanding the influence of social norm and personal norm on travel mode choice preference is essential in promoting sustainable travel, considering the reported importance of these social forces in decision-making. This study draws upon the theories underpinning these sociological constructs and the integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) framework to develop an ","One of the most significant challenges confronting urban centres is the increasing motorisation on the roads and its attendant traffic congestions. Cities continue to review, develop, and implement new strategies directed at curbing this situation, yet the trend continues (Transport Scotland, 2018b). Unfortunately, this phenomenon is detrimental not only to the well-being of urban dwellers but the environment as well. Major cities around the world, including Edinburgh, continue to observe this worrying trend (Shan & John, 2015; TomTom International, 2016; Transport Scotland, 2018b), despite the observed “peak car” in some cities (Goodwin & Dender, 2013; Millard-Ball & Schipper, 2011) and the conscious efforts to reverse the trend.====However, transport models developed to understand, explain, and address travel behaviour and the observed trend above have come short of reversing the observed trend. Literature is replete with evidence suggesting that human behaviour, and for that matter travel behaviour, besides economic factors and physical infrastructure, is also shaped by social and cultural forces as well (Ben-akiva & Bierlaire, 1999; Halonen, 2020; Liu et al., 2017; Manski, 1973; Simon, 1955). Social norms (an ideal form of behaviour to which individuals in a social group conform to) is suggested to significantly sway individual or group behaviour (Cialdini et al., 1991, 1999; Cialdini, 2007; Halonen, 2020; Hiselius & Rosqvist, 2016; Riggs, 2016, 2017). Norms are related to herding behaviour, the effectiveness of which comes from the social penalties or possible reputational damage for non-compliance or the social benefits of conformity (DellaVigna, 2009). Therefore, economic, and physical interventions alone are inadequate to deliver behavioural change and sustainable travel.====There is a substantial amount of literature on the link between travel behaviour and sociological factors (Avineri, 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Aczél & Markovits-somogyi, 2013; Avineri et al., 2009; Ferreira & Wijngaard, 2019; Metcalfe & Dolan, 2012; Schroeder et al., 1983; Simon, 1982). According to these studies, social norms, activated social norms in the form of personal norms, and pro-environmental attitudes are essential for delivering sustainable behaviour change; specifically, travel behaviour change, as well as influences behavioural intentions and actual behaviour (Bamberg et al., 2007; Belgiawan et al., 2016; Cialdini et al., 1991).====Considering the reported importance of social forces in decision-making, this study explores the impact of norms (social and personal) on the travel behaviour of the population of Edinburgh, Scotland. The primary objective is to understand whether personal norms and social norms are of comparative significance to objective factors (such as income, age, car ownership and walking distance to bus stops) in the choice of transport mode (Avineri, 2009, pp. 28–29; Bamberg et al., 2007; Belgiawan et al., 2016; Cialdini et al., 1991; Schwartz, 1977). Unlike studies involving social norms and personal norms, this research is novel because it empirically examines the effect of norms (perceived social norms and personal norm) on travel mode choice behaviour by incorporating them as latent variables in an ICLV model. We estimate and compare an ICLV model and MNL model to assess whether the presence of social norms and personal norm as latent variables improves the power of the choice models and the extent to which both latent variables affect individual observed travel preferences. We analysed a sample size of 500 respondents collected through revealed preference travel survey using postal survey in Edinburgh for this study. We hypothesize that both social norms and personal norms significantly impact travel mode choice preferences. The results are consistent with and contribute to the literature, and also the findings have implications for PT policy design.====The results demonstrate that personal norm or pro-environmental attitudes rather than social norms influence the choice of transport mode. The results also suggest that individuals with pro-environmental attitude are likely to travel with sustainable travel modes. Thus, reinforcing the importance of sociological and psychological factors in decision-making. The findings are relevant for policy-making, the development of policies meant to create awareness of the consequences of travel behaviour could promote the development of strong personal norms, and consequently influence travel decision making.====The paper is structured as follows: We start with the review of relevant literature on the tie between Norms and travel behaviour, followed by the methodology and data collection process. Next, the paper presents a description of the sample data and initial analysis of the indicators for assessing norms. The fifth section covers the model estimation and the framework for incorporating the latent variables into the choice model.

We estimated six types of classification models that could allow for more precise recommendations yet are simple enough to be applied by the authorities. We considered typical variables as population and Gross Domestic Product of cities but also geographic and morphologic characteristics in a database of 400 cities from North and South America. Ordered Probit and Multinomial Logit models were the most accurate, with a success rate over 80% in the validation subset. Among the explanatory variables, city population and GDP per capita were as expected the most significant, but fare integration, car ownership and city shape were also relevant.

While the academic literature focuses on optimization models that incorporate the specific behavior of people, stakeholders taking strategic decisions usually rely on general recommendations (Chen, 2017) which are based on limited case studies, such as the Bus Rapid Transit guide (TRB, 2003) that recommends this technology for cities over 750,000. These recommendations consider the public transport modes that cities currently have but are usually poor in explanatory variables and use small datasets.

It is, therefore, unclear how at the micro level, the business firms within an ==== is restructuring internally to accommodate the technological innovations. Insights of this process management is uniquely valuable to understand how local technological niches and larger socio-technological transformations are being accommodated in industrial reforms. A business model perspective could provide insights of these innovation process management, in this context the mobility transition from fixed to flexible public transport (FPT) systems. Taking business models as the unit of analysis, in this paper we provide a framework to map the transition process. The framework is applied to a case study of a traditional public transport firm in the Netherlands. We map the evolution of the business models taking the local external developments into account. We define three phases for the business model mapping here – pre FPT, during FPT and the future of FPT. Findings suggest a complete shift in client orientation of public transport authorities with geared up efforts in digitalization and value creation during these three phases of FPT transition. Perhaps the most striking - yet not completely unexpected – outcome for transit companies is to gradually assume a role of facilitator as opposed to a provider of public transit, which potentially will have a thorough reform of the industry. This initial trace of internal transition, however incomplete, provides useful insights of the overall product and process management and the emerging business model configurations and contributes to the learning trajectory of FPT service organizations.","Contemporary transportation sector is witnessing a paradigm shift from fixed to flexible public transport (FPT) provisions. Rising population in cities and changing demand profiles with less scheduled and more flexible day to travel needs have made the transport providers and local authorities to overhaul their service provisions. The possibilities opened up with the age of internet and big data showed the way that a personalized on-demand transport offers are not impossible to achieve. The challenges lie however to make this transition smooth and safe to offer seamless service across urban regions. Beyond adding flexibility, understanding transitions is important now more than ever, given the pandemic caused by the Covid 19 outbreak, the evolution process of the organizational parameters would help strategize to respond to changing transit scenarios as well as demands. This study sheds light on such processes providing a practical and replicable analytical framework.====Among the FPT offers, simplest and perhaps most common forms are demand responsive transits (DRT) and paratransit to complex integrated forms, such as, Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Implementing FPTs essentially means adding third party ‘intermediaries’, often referred to as platform provider, within the traditional public transport system who would offer real time service alternatives to the end user. The end user will buy their services through the platform operator and would get flexible travel advice catered to personal preferences, including any adjustments caused by disruptions to allow seamless service provision.====; ====; ====).

We identify the differences and similarities among traditional and new business models in public transport regime. In doing so we shed light on the co-existence and co-evolving aspects of the FPT service provisions of traditional public transport network operators.

In the course of this exploratory research, a methodology combining analyses in three pillars is developed. The three pillars are manifestation of outcome goals in urban mobility plans, implementability analysis of measures, and trend in changes of modal share. The results from these three pillars are synthesized to draw a conclusion. Among the cities analyzed in this research, cities with more integrated competences for public transport at public bodies tend to make quantitative and time-bound policy goals towards modal shift to be successful in achieving desired modal share. In reverse, cities with more disperse competence distribution tend to show less clarity in its policy manifestation, and to be less successful in shifting the modal share towards optimal modal share in light of sustainable mobility. Among the successful cities, the cities internalizing the competence within the public body tend to attain desired modal share more successfully than cities controlling the service parameters through public ownership of operators.","To ensure sustainability, one of the most important policy goals is to ensure high modal shares of public transport and active modes (e.g. Pucher, 1988). To this end, integrated and multimodal transport strategies are developed (e.g. May, Kelly, et al., 2005; UNESCAP, 2017), typically adopting backcasting approach. Backcasting is a planning method that proceeds with a desirable future, and then plan backwards to identify policy instruments to be implemented so that the desired future can be attained (Dreborg, 1996; Holmberg & Robert, 2000; Robinson, 2003). Packaging policy measures is one of the key features in the integrated transport strategy (May, 2003): for example, restricting car use need to be coupled with improvement of the availability and attractiveness of public transport, cycling and walking (e.g. Banister, 2008). Integrated transport strategies need to be complemented by other policy areas, such as parking and land use policy (e.g. May, Kelly, et al., 2005; Wegener & Fuerst, 2004).====As roads and streets are almost ubiquitously public properties, implementation of policy measures for the active modes and private motorized modes are generally within the competences of the public bodies. This is not to say that the public authority is only the stakeholder: others such as residents, shopkeepers, interest groups, and user associations can potentially play important roles in decision-making and implementation of measures. However, as for implementation of measures, the public authority is the primary institution with the competence for it.====Public transport is different in that the action of movement is undertaken by public transport operators, which provide services based on basic service parameters such as network, stations and stops, timetable and pricing. These service parameters are not necessarily set by public bodies, as operators, which is technically specialized in day-to-day operation, may play important roles in decision-making for them. This makes implementation of policy measures for public transport more complex than the other urban modes of transport. Another type of complexity is embedded in public transport: operators can be a public agency, a government-owned enterprise, a public-private mixed company, or a private firm, and the market structure varies from competitive ones under which many private operators compete against each other to public monopolies (e.g. Bayliss, 2002). In some countries, public transport associations play important roles for integration of public transport services provided by different operators (e.g. Doungporn & Ieda, 2007; Heschtera, 1994; Pucher & Kurth, 1995; Schroll, 2014). This complexity of public transport is reflected in implementation of policy measures to encourage the use of public transport: on one hand, many of such policy measures involve adjustments of service parameters, but on the other hands public authorities does not necessarily have the competence to change the service parameters.====This complexity in the organization structure may impede the implementation of policy measures to deliver sustainable mobility by improving public transport. Available measures for sustainable mobility are well known (Banister, 2008) and are transferrable among cities (e.g. Marsden & Stead, 2011), but implementation of measures may have to include public or private sector bodies beyond the control of the public sector bodies in charge of delivery of transport policy. Marsden and May (2006) already pointed this out in a case study comparing a franchised model and deregulated environments in the UK. Integrated transport strategies are within the competence of public bodies, but the public body does not necessarily have direct controls needed to implement measures for public transport. This could be a critical factor preventing an efficient delivery of policy towards sustainable urban mobility by making public transport attractive.====These differences between public transport and other urban transport modes lead to several questions: to what extent can the public body control the service parameters of public transport? Are policy measures practically implementable within the competence of the public body, or do their implementation have to involve negotiation with private sector bodies which may potentially lead to an impedance by them? How does the landscape of controllability by public bodies look like? In transport strategies, are the measures selected with the competence of the public body taken into consideration, or regardless of it? Do these differences have influences on actual changes in the modal share? Are there any “optimal” organization structures to ensure public-sector control of service parameters towards sustainable urban mobility?====Ideally, accumulation of case studies from many cities can address these questions, but this calls for extensive resources and time, leading to impracticability of study.====Alternatively, in this research, a comparative and exploratory study is carried out with three pillars: (1) analysis of manifestation of outcome goals in transport strategies (urban mobility plans), (2) implementability analysis of measures, and (3) comparison of changes in modal shares. The results from these three pillars are synthesized in a relative manner at the end as discussions.====The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, a literature review is presented, followed by an overview of the analysis methodology combining the three pillars in Section 3. Section 4 Urban mobility plans, 5 Implementability of measures, 6 Changes of modal share corresponds to each of the three pillars: Section 4 for urban mobility plans, Section 5 for implementability of policy measures, and Section 6 for modal share trend.

Key findings are that: (i) for the tendered contracts, significant cost reductions were achieved compared with previous tendering rounds, reflecting the considerable increase in the number of bidders per contract; and (ii) for the negotiated contracts, (gross) costs averaged about 10–15% higher (Auckland) and 30–35% higher (Wellington) than the equivalent tendered costs.====These cost disparities reflected the weak position of the regional councils in their contract negotiations with the operators, as a result of the councils not having recourse to tendering as a fallback negotiating position and coming under considerable time pressures to introduce the new services.","One of the key Thredbo conference topics since 1989 has been the relative ‘value for money’ achievable by different models of procuring urban bus services, particularly focusing on periodic competitive tendering (CT) versus continuing operation by the incumbent operator on a negotiated price basis and subject to meeting performance benchmarks (NC). A major practical problem generally encountered in attempting such comparisons has been the lack of situations suitable for ‘like-for-like’ comparisons. The CT and NC situations for comparison have typically differed by such factors as types of area (e.g. inner vs outer urban areas), type of services to be provided, contract sizes and durations, asset ownership and funding arrangements, performance requirements and other contract conditions.====Most of these potential comparison problems were overcome in the recent reforms of local public transport (principally bus) services in New Zealand, under the new Public Transport Operating Model (PTOM). Under this reform model, since 2016 all urban bus service contracts have been specified on a similar basis, involving a group of routes, a gross cost funding basis, bus and depot provision by the operator, and with similar contract performance requirements and financial arrangements.====Within this common contracting framework, services have been procured on one of two bases:====Apart from the different bases of operator selection, in most respects the PTOM procurement processes were very similar: in both cases, a Request for Tender (RfT) document was issued, either on an ‘open’ basis (CT) or on a ‘closed’ basis to the incumbent operator only (NC), with respondents required to submit contract prices and other details of their service offering. The tendered (CT) contracts in each region were evaluated first, using a price versus quality trade-off approach. This established the preferred operator for each contract, with an associated gross contract price to be paid from the start of the contract.==== The negotiated (NC) contracts were then subject to a negotiation process, taking account of both the operator's initial bid price and the prices recently established for comparable CT contracts in the same region.====This situation has provided an almost-ideal opportunity to compare contract prices established for NC with those recently established through CT for comparable services in the same region under comparable terms and conditions. These contract price comparisons are the main subject of this paper.====The paper focuses on the author's analyses for NZ's two major metropolitan areas: for Auckland they cover 50 contracts (23 CT, 27 NC) requiring some 1100 buses, for Wellington 16 contracts (9 CT, 7 NC) for some 400 buses. Analyses of contract costs (prices) were undertaken at the individual contract level, but with the primary focus on the comparative cost findings for the CT group and NC group of contracts.====To complement the cost analyses, the author held interviews with the regional authorities and other parties involved in the procurement process.

In these regions regional public transport authorities are responsible for the procurement. The paper reports findings on how the designs of the incentives are motivated, how the performance monitoring is managed, and the consistency in charging of penalties and how outcomes have evolved. Two design forms are found, either charges for individual deviations or deviations from an aggregate target level. Little motivation is found in form of narrated or documented intended effects, experience of penalty design or the outcomes of penalties. Outcomes are monitored regularly by contract managers, based on computerized data capture. There appears to be no detailed records of charging making it possible to compare to outcomes. There are indications of non-negligible exemptions from charging attributed to factors beyond the control of operators. The current level of delivered departures is high in both regions but shows no clear trend. The aggregate level punctuality appears to be decreasing at both the RPTAs, but only statistically significant for one. The picture is complicated by the fact that punctuality develops differently in different parts of the regions. The paper reflects the uneven availability of data and documentation of mangagement procedures.","In Sweden continuously improving the quality of local public transport as perceived by the travelers is a central goal (Pyddoke & Swärdh, 2017). This goal is frequently operationalized by measures of customer satisfaction. As most local public transport is tendered, this has led to varying provisions taken by regional public transport authorities (RPTA) to ensure a high level of objective and perceived quality in the contracts with operators. A frequent form of such provisions are penalties and bonuses for customer satisfaction. Some RPTAs also direct penalties and bonuses at cancelled or delayed departures. Such penalties and bonuses have been a long-standing part of public transport contracting (Hensher & Wallis, 2005) and, at least in Sweden, are considered by some RPTAs as indispensable to ensure quality outcomes.====But do the current forms of quality incentives as penalties perform well? Theoretically precise penalties and bonuses adjusted to take account of the value of the potential improvement would give operators incentives to take desired actions. But in practice there are a multitude of possible deviations from the theoretical ideals. For psychological reasons there are reasons to believe that agents do not respond symmetrically to penalties and bonuses (Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). This theory has also been applied to contract analysis (e.g. Bigoni et al., 2014). If the ability to monitor and classify the causes of quality flaws varies between instances, then the incentives may be skewed. As there are concerns that operators should not be burdened with risks which they cannot efficiently influence, there are practices involving contract managers (the employees at the RPTAs directly responsible for monitoring the performance of the operator and for supervising the payments) excluding instances from charging. For these and other reasons, the actual quality outcomes may be smaller than ideally and therefore there is reason to examine how the management of penalties affects outcomes.====The aim of this paper is to analyze penalties for cancelled and delayed departures in Swedish local public transport contracts. The analysis asks five questions. First, how are the penalties designed? Second, what are these designs expected to achieve? Third, how are the outcomes monitored? Fourth, to which extent are observed flaws, as defined in contracts, actually charged? Fifth, what outcomes in the quality dimensions associated with penalties have been observed? A further aim is to explore the possibilities for a larger, more systematic study of effects of quality incentives. This study is limited to penalties for cancellations and delays in contracts for bus services in Stockholm and Skåne regions tendered by their RPTAs. There is no goal for this project of performing anything like an audit of neither individual employees nor the individual RPTA. Therefore, all employees and observations on RPTAs are anonymized.====The contribution of this paper lies in four parts. The first is that this is a recent update on the meager empirical literature on quality incentives in public transport and their effects. The second is that it gives an update on the then current state of availability of Swedish data on quality outcomes and accounting on penalty payments. The third is that it reports on awareness among of some of the employees at two RPTAs about the motivations for current practices and analytical efforts expended by their respective organizations. The fourth is that it uses the scarce data to produce some novel indications on the possible impacts of Swedish practices for quality contracting on outcomes.====This study is based on interviews with 10 employees at two RPTAs, Skånetrafiken and Trafikförvaltningen Region Stockholm, and was presented and discussed at a meeting with a subcommittee for procurement issues in The Swedish Bus and Coach Federation (Sveriges bussföretag). Employees at the RPTAs also provided documents: parts of contracts and monitoring documentation. In addition, further statistical information has been collected from open sources. Although Sweden has an open access constitution, many documents were not made available, and it remains an open question if, and to what degree, such documents should be made public.",Penalties as incentives for punctuality and regularity in tendered Swedish public transport,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301463,11 September 2020,2020,Research Article,219.0

This is particularly important in rural areas where the range and extent of public transport services are, in general, significantly lower than in urban areas, and, indeed, below the level required to provide a level of service that is sufficiently high to enable people in rural areas without private cars to access these services. This paper looks at the role of governments in institutional, organisational, regulatory and financial frameworks in supporting ","Urban areas have higher populations and much greater economic activity than rural areas, and as a consequence usually attract much greater attention than rural areas in terms of transport service provision. In addition, the proximity of people's homes to services and amenities (relative to that in rural areas) makes the provision of adequate transport services much easier in urban areas than in rural areas. The difficulties of providing transport in rural areas have been well documented for many years (St. John Thomas, 1963; Moseley, 1979). Essentially, the low demands for travel in rural areas make it economically unfeasible for transport operators to run the range of services that are necessary to satisfy the public transport users' mobility needs; the rural transport supply does not meet the demand of people's mobility needs. Services are then often pared back repeatedly as a result; at each stage the diminishing transport offer gives rise to a diminishing demand for travel by public transport. This vicious circle generally leads to a public transport offering and demand level well below that which might have been sustainable had realistic, yet difficult, measures been implemented at a sufficiently early stage. Limited public transport services in rural areas impacts negatively on people's mobility options and leads to an over-reliance on private car as a mode of transportation.====Lack of rural mobility impacts on people's ability to access services, and hence on people's quality of life. In particular, the people who are most impacted negatively are the more vulnerable members of society such as the elderly, disabled and children, since these are the people less likely to own or have access to a car (Shergold et al., 2012). Furthermore, the value of other services such as education and health services, is lessened if people are less able to access these services through a lack of rural mobility; similarly, job opportunities may be compromised without access to adequate transport services (Wright et al., 2009). Ideally, rural areas would be served by an efficient, comprehensive and coordinated multimodal transport system capable of linking rural communities with each other and with urban areas. However, this is rarely the case, particularly in Europe, where recent austerity measures are putting further pressure on already limited funding for rural transport services, at a time when it is sorely needed. Current prevailing trends such as rural depopulation and ageing rural populations are compounding the problem. As a result, many rural areas throughout Europe do not have the range of transport services and connections that are required by the people who live and work there. Section 2 will give more detail about the rural mobility problem, including different ways in which rurality can be defined and measured; rurality data for countries across Europe; and information about the range of transport services available in rural areas.====It is reasonable for people living in rural areas to expect to be able to access fundamental services such as health and educational services. However, the transport services in rural areas may not be adequate to ensure proper access to these services; this raises the question of the role of government in the provision of adequate transport services to ensure this access. Whether providing these transport services directly (either by operating the services themselves or more likely by some local authority) or by commissioning an operator to operate the transport services, the services are often not financially sustainable, meaning that the only way for them to continue operating is if they are subsidised by government (at least to some degree). This then raises the issue of whether, and to what extent, rural transport services should be subsidised, supporting the right of people to live in rural areas; this issue is discussed in Section 2. In answering this question, it is important to consider the value of rural space in itself, not only to its inhabitants, but also to its visitors, who also need transport to the countryside.====The frameworks for rural mobility put in place by governments, including the institutional, regulatory, organisational and financial frameworks, have significant impacts on rural transport provision. Section 3 looks at how the various frameworks can contribute, as well as create barriers to, rural transport provision. It will also look at framework data==== for countries across Europe (the EU-28, which were the European Union member states from July 2013 until January 2020) and perform a cluster analysis to identify distinct classes of framework types across Europe. Governments should provide frameworks and conditions that support, rather than inhibit, transport services in rural areas. Such transport services are often community-led initiatives, some of which may be identified as examples of ‘good practice’. Section 4 looks at examples of good practice across a range of themes and considers how the potential for these good practices to be transferred from one place to another, and how the supporting conditions might be put in place for this best to be achieved. Finally, Section 5 draws together conclusions from the paper.",On the role of frameworks and smart mobility in addressing the rural mobility problem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301542,11 September 2020,2020,Research Article,220.0

This study aims to identify how social, political, and cultural components may affect levels of fare evasion experienced to complement and broaden the current research lines.====A longitudinal ====Results confirm existence of a positive autoregressive effect, suggesting a contagious effect in behaviour. An increase in level of inspection reduces fare evasion and an increase in bus fares increases fare evasion. New findings of this study include introduction of government approval and confidence/trust towards political and ==== and the ruling class as variables with a contrary effect towards fare evasion, i.e. a decrease in government approval and confidence/trust increases fare evasion.","Although fare evasion is a common problem in transport systems worldwide, the level of fare evasion experienced in Transantiago is approximately six to seven times higher than the global average of 4.2% (Guarda et al., 2016a), reaching its highest level in December 2016 at 34.6% and 25.5% in the second trimester of 2018 (Programa Nacional de Fiscalización, 2018). These high levels of fare evasion translate to a considerable amount of pressure on the financial sustainability of the systems, considering that the operating costs must be covered by fare revenue and government subsidy. The annual losses due to fare evasion for Transantiago are estimated to be USD 140 million (EMOL, 2017). For the year 2015, it was estimated that losses due to fare evasion where 50% of the subsidy provided to the system (Allen et al., 2019). In addition to their direct costs, the research on behavioural ethics shows that daily dishonesty lowers trust, encourages negative social norms, spreads and increases the prevalence of other unethical behaviours (Ayal et al., 2019), leading to a potential vicious cycle when the fare evading behaviour increases. Studies also show that an increase in fare evasion provokes perceptions of mistrust and insecurity in passengers, increases the psychological discomfort, and discourages the use of public transportation (Bijleveld, 2007; Killias et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 2011).====Fare evasion interventions have commonly focused on systems which are designed to punish fare evaders and optimise enforcement through inspections and physical barriers. Studies traditionally have considered passengers as rational actors who consider a trade-off between the costs and benefits of avoiding fare payment; alternatively, they have considered fare evasion as a reaction to operational/service characteristics and enforcement levels (Barabino et al., 2014, 2013; Clarke et al., 2010; Guarda et al., 2016a, 2016b; Killias et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 2011). This perspective of fare evasion does not consider the social, political, and cultural contexts in which fare evasion occurs, thereby excluding components which could be affecting the disposition of users to evade fares.====The measures considered for lowering fare evasion in Santiago include increased pursuit of fare evaders by increasing inspections, penalties, and the creation of a fare evader registry and the enforcement of fare payment by establishing physical barriers at the entry (which hinder the efficient operation of the system). All these measures are based on microeconomic and operational factors and do not attempt to determine the underlying causes of fare evasion. Moreover, current and past measures have lowered fare evasion for a small amount of time, but the increasing trend reappears. This suggests that fare evasion is not a problem that can be solved by only considering technical and operational methods, but it should be studied and intervened considering a multidisciplinary approach.====Recent studies in Chile (Buneder, 2016; Buneder & Galilea, 2017; Troncoso & de Grange, 2017) have expanded on the literature by including factors such as political approval and economic factors; however, social factors such as the level of anomie were not included. Expanding on a recent perspective on fare evasion (profiling the fare evader or understanding the motivations of the fare evaders), this study includes variables related to the political and cultural environment of an individual and not the personal motivation behind fare evasion. As Hauber (1980) suggests, subcultural norms have a high importance when explaining fare evasion; however, subcultural components are associated with the immediate circle of an individual (friends, family, etc.) and do not consider culture in a macro level. More importantly, as far as we are aware, no study has yet considered an analysis of fare evasion in relation to the approval rate of the government, trust levels, and the social state of anomie, i.e. low levels of satisfaction, low trust in the political and economic systems, and the lack of ethical norms or social standards in a society, which can result in an individual not identifying with the guidelines surrounding them or not feeling represented by society, which can result in a disposition to fare evasion. This occurs either because the individuals do not recognise the validity of the established social contract or because the individuals deliberately want to take from a system that they perceive as unjust and corrupt.====This primary goal of this study is to identify how social, political, and cultural components may affect the levels of fare evasion and disposition of the users to fare evade. Specifically, this study analyses socio-political variables and factors related to the state of social anomie, to identify how the lack of social control and diminished institutional or social trust may affect the levels of fare evasion.====In this paper a longitudinal econometric analysis is presented using aggregated data from May 2010 to May 2018, modelled through an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to determine the impact of transport system variables (bus fare, ticket inspection, number of paid zones, and quality), macroeconomic variables (unemployment and informal employment), and socio-political variables (approval of Transantiago, approval of the government, reference to scandals in political, economic, and religious institutions in the media, and general trust/confidence experienced at the social or individual level).====The results obtained confirm the existence of a positive autoregressive effect, suggesting a contagious effect in the behaviour of users. According to our model, an increase in the level of inspection reduces fare evasion while an elevation in bus fare increases this rate. The new findings of this study include the introduction of the positive perspective regarding the government and confidence/trust towards political and economic institutions and the ruling class as variables with an inverse effect on fare evasion, i.e. a decrease in the approval rate of the government and confidence/trust increases the fare evasion and a greater level of anomie leads to an increase in the levels of fare evasion.====Finally, our research complements and broadens the current research lines and proposes new strategies of intervention by including variables that are not only related to operational factors and level of enforcement. Understanding the underlying causes of fare evasion helps to provide a better knowledge about fare evasion and its actors. Some of the proposals of this paper are focused primarily on how public transport agencies and the government can decrease fare evasion by increasing institutional trust, changing their fare payment and enforcement of fines, implementing bus fare strategies, and how service quality affects fare evasion, thus expanding the tools that are available for protecting the revenues from reduction owing to fare evasion.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: the next section is a literature review of fare evasion; section 3 sets the theoretical background, explaining how socio-political aspects such as trust, media references to scandals, social influence, and anomie might be affecting fare evasion; section 4 explains the econometrical methodology followed, including an explanation of the data set used, a correlation and co-integration analysis of the explanatory variables, and an analysis of the temporal behaviour of fare evasion; section 5 outlines the primary results of this study; in section 6, we propose four types of public policies based on our results; finally, section 7 outlines the primary conclusions of this study.",Temporal analysis of fare evasion in Transantiago: A socio-political view,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301566,10 September 2020,2020,Research Article,221.0

Especially in the rail industry, the origins and destinations of passengers are not usually stations, and access to and egress from stations are always required. Compared to the percentage of distance travelled in access and egress during the entire journey, the percentage of time spent in the corresponding parts of the journey is much greater (Krygsman et al., 2004). When travel time multiplier—which converts time spent out-of-vehicle to equivalent time spent in-vehicle—is considered, the percentage of time spent in access and egress on an equivalent in-vehicle time basis is even larger. For the access and egress legs, a typical travel time multiplier is two, meaning that 1 min spent in access/egress is equivalent to 2 min spent inside a vehicle (Wardman et al., 2016).====Non-motorised transportation modes play a greater role in the access and egress legs due to their shorter distances. These modes are human powered and vulnerable to environmental factors, such as weather, topographical factors, and time of day. A focus of the present study is the topographical factors. Topographical factors are time-invariant, while other factors, such as weather and time of day, vary over time. The present study mainly focuses on the topographical factors that affect daily mode choices, but this study does mention other environmental factors that affect occasional modal changes.====Introducing notions of home-end and activity-end for a journey facilitates understanding of access and egress mode choices. Access and egress sometimes are confusing in the sense that the access leg of an outbound journey is identical to the mirrored egress leg of an inbound journey. Combining the ends of journey (home- or activity-end) and directions of journey (access or egress) produces home/access, home/egress, activity/access, and activity/egress. Most studies analysing terminal transport modal choices addressed only one of these four. The present study does not discuss the choices of home- and activity-end, which are determined by the scope of the analysis. On the other hand, the choice of either access or egress at the same end of a journey requires discussion. An assumption made in previous studies is that the same transportation mode is used for both access and egress at the same end. While this assumption is acceptable in most contexts, it is open to discussion in studies that analyse topographical factors.====The present study aims to analyse both access and egress transport mode choice at the activity-end of the journey. The analysis is focused on Kobe University (Kobe, Japan) and student access and egress mode choice at the activity-end (between their university campus and their nearest railway stations). Four campuses of Kobe University were chosen for the analysis. In Kobe, three railway lines run parallel to each other east to west. From north to south, these are the Hankyu line, the JR (Japan Railways) line, and the Hanshin line. Students that commute to/from the university by rail usually use one of three stations: Rokko on the Hankyu line, Rokkomichi on the JR line, and Mikage on the Hanshin line. This choice of study area has the following advantages for this study.====First, topographical factors play an important role on the modal choices in the first-mile and last-mile contexts in the study area. A notable geographic characteristic of the study area is the differences in altitude; the four campuses range between 130 m and 205 m in altitude, while the three stations range between 10 m and 60 m in altitude. Therefore, students must climb around 70–195 m to reach their campus. The distances between the stations and the campuses range between 1.1 km and 3.9 km. Therefore, the issues addressed in the present study are for typical first- and last-mile transportation.====Second, collecting the data required some effort. If the origin and destination of the access/egress leg at the activity-end are not fixed, then considerable effort is needed to prepare the topographical data for each leg. To reduce data processing requirements, the present study limits the access/egress leg to station-campus pairs. Of course, this approach limits variations in the data, but the station-campus pairs included in the present study mean the analysis remains meaningful. Also, because the author is employed at Kobe University, data from students of that university was easy to collect.====Third and finally, students have various preferences in their mode choices. The transport modes chosen by students between the stations and campuses include walking, bus, taxi, and motorcycle. Walking is attractive for distances of less than one or 2 km, but walking uphill for 20–30 min is not easy for all students. A good bus service is provided between the stations and campuses by the City of Kobe. These buses run at intervals of less than 10 min during the morning peak hours and cost JPY 210. Another public transport option is to take a taxi. Although a taxi is more expensive than a bus, the cost is reasonable when students share the ride with friends. (Uber and other ride-sharing services are not allowed in Japan.) Motorcycles are more popular than bicycles due to the mountainous topology. In addition, some students change transportation mode in response to occasional environmental factors. Moreover, some students choose different transportation modes depending on whether they are going uphill or downhill. Analysing these issues also is of interest in this study.====This study investigates the following research questions (RQ1–RQ4) by comparing the aggregate shares and estimating disaggregate choice models. Although the topographical factor is the centre of the analysis, other factors are mentioned when necessary. In addition, the analyses in this paper provide the basis for comments on recent policies in Kobe to facilitate modal integration between the railways and buses for students. Note that the analyses do not treat each research question in the order shown here.==== In the Conclusions Section (Section 8), the findings for each research question are summarised with reference to the analyses presented in the paper.====The present study consisted of two parts: a questionnaire survey and an interview with the Kobe City's Bureau of Transport. The questionnaire survey was conducted in November 2017 and surveyed students' most, second-most, and third-most frequently used transportation modes from various stations to their campus and the reasons for changing modes. The transportation modes of travel from the four campuses to the three stations also are surveyed. The stated preference (SP) survey asked about the choices between bus and walking when a direct (non-stop) bus service is introduced between stations and campuses. Kobe City recently introduced a policy to facilitate modal integration between the railway and bus services by providing direct bus service from railway stations to schools. This paper includes a summary of an interview with Kobe City's Bureau of Transport in which the policy is explained.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.

This has been matched by the work of transport economists who have been advancing the field of economic appraisals using ,"Customer experience on public transport can be affected by a variety of factors that are typically classified into ‘hard’ factors (e.g. mode, service frequency, right of way, operating hours, and fares) and ‘soft factors (Fearnley et al., 2015). Soft factors, commonly referred to as ‘customer amenities’, are a range of ancillary improvements to public transport that do not directly relate to quantitative operations or service, but improve the passenger experience quality (Currie et al., 2013). For example, customer amenities can be information provisions, passenger facilities, station/stop quality, and personal security measures.====Although many studies have been undertaken to determine the value that public transport passengers place on different types of customer amenities (Steer Davies Gleave, 2000; Robson, 2009; Outwater et al., 2014; Douglas, 2016), with selected values available in published guidelines (Transport for London, 2014; TransportandInfrastructure Council, 2017), there is a very limited understanding of current practice across public transport agencies in the use of customer amenity valuations. In particular, the extent to which agencies estimate and apply customer amenity values when appraising and evaluating different types of public transport projects is not well understood. A better understanding of current practice can help to establish the relative importance of customer amenity valuations for project appraisal purposes and to determine the extent to which customer amenities are considered across different types of public transport projects. Through benchmarking, it can also help to identify areas of advanced practice across agencies, which can then guide the choice of methods adopted elsewhere.====This paper aims to provide an overview of current world research and practice concerning the valuation of public transport amenity/soft factor initiatives across selected Australasian and international public transport agencies in estimating and applying public transport customer amenity valuations.

In large multimodal public transport networks, interchanges or transfers for passengers are inevitable. A zone-based fare system ensures there is no financial penalty for interchange thus minimising the interchange penalty. In Brisbane, South East Queensland, Australia, the zone-based fare system does not penalise transfers within the same zone but charges a full fare for an inter-zone transfer within a single journey. The open system BRT in Brisbane, Australia is used as a case study with a sensitivity analysis on transfer rates to understand how open system operation has facilitated multimodal mobility between conventional bus and BRT services. Web-based simulation maps compare a closed BRT scenario with the open BRT system in operation. The coverage and volume of passengers are significantly reduced in the closed system scenario, especially for routes inbound to the Central Business District (CBD), since far fewer passengers in suburban areas would have direct BRT services. In Brisbane's current open system, there are fewer opportunities for multimodal trips because buses travel on and off the BRT infrastructure. This analysis can help urban transport agencies to optimise their BRT operations and provide better public transport services.","Many cities have established multimodal public transport systems to encourage the use of public transport and to reduce car ownership and use. Large multimodal public transport networks can provide passengers with more travel options; however, interchanges or transfers, which might inconvenience passengers, are inevitable (Vuchic, 2006). One or more transfers are made on public transport trips in many major cities around the world: in 80% in New York, 70% in Munich, 50% in Melbourne, 40% in Paris and 30% of trips in London (New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC), 1998; Transport for London, 2001; Group for Urban Interchanges Development and Evaluation, 2000; Currie & Loader, 2010; Guo & Wilson, 2011). Transfers usually have a negative impact on passengers’ willingness to travel because of extra walk and wait times and even transfer fees referred to as “transfer penalties” (Han, 1987; Liu et al., 1997; Yen et al., 2018). Empirical studies show that requiring transfers on public transport routes can reduce public transport ridership and mode share. When introducing a new transit system into a city, an important issue is how to integrate it with the current public transport system to maximise multimodal mobility.====A zone-based fare system has the potential to ensure that there is no financial penalty for interchange if the travel is within the same zone. South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia has a zone-based fare system which does not penalise transfers within the same zone but does charge full fare for an inter-zone transfer in a single journey. The public transport system includes bus, heavy rail, light rail and ferry. The historical trends in public transport patronage for Brisbane accounts for 70% of the weekday trips within the broader region of SEQ (Transport and Main Roads, 2012). More than half of public transport users in Brisbane use BRT bus as their major mode. Bus has higher patronage than train in Brisbane, with 54% of public transport trips by bus and 44% by train (BITRE, 2013). Unlike other major cities in Australia, bus has the highest public transport mode in Brisbane. This might be due to the design of the major bus infrastructure, the BRT system, which this study uses to explore the multimodal mobility issue associated with BRT design.====When planners or government agencies plan a BRT system, an important decision is whether the system should be open or closed to conventional buses. An open BRT system allows buses to use BRT infrastructure as part of their routes. However, in a closed BRT system, only BRT buses are allowed to operate in the BRT corridor. The decision about an open or a closed BRT system represents a trade-off between larger catchment areas on the one hand and the opportunity to benefit from higher frequency service in the BRT corridor. The design of the BRT system will have direct impacts on intra-modal mobility (e.g., the transfer needs in BRT stations for bus services in a closed BRT system) and indirect impacts on inter-modal mobility (e.g., the transfer needs in both BRT and rail stations in a closed BRT system). A comprehensive understanding of open vs. closed systems can help transport planners and decision-makers improve their BRT system planning and maximise transport investment benefit and multimodal mobility. This is especially true as some cities with open BRT systems, such as Brisbane, are considering turning their open BRT system into a closed system with the development of their ‘Metro’ system.==== It is also very important for cities implementing newly designed BRT systems. Is an open or closed BRT system better at providing a seamless user experience? There is no doubt that the choice of network design affects overall system mobility, but empirical evidence is lacking. In order to investigate the performance of BRT systems, this research uses a visual analytic approach to show how an open system BRT in Brisbane facilitates daily mobility by using Brisbane's public transport smartcard data.====The next section provides more detail on the difference between open and closed BRT systems. This is followed by a section on the case context of the Brisbane BRT system. The method follows, together with a description of the data used in this analysis. The results are then provided and interpreted. The conclusions section highlights this study's significance and limitations of the results.","How does an open system bus rapid transit (BRT) facilitate inter and intra-modal mobility?

While individual modes used during the first/last mile (1LM) trip, such as walking and feeder buses, have been widely studied, the multimodal and diverse nature of the 1LM environment is rarely dealt with. The paper presents a methodology for assessing the quality of the 1LM environment that combines objective measures with user perceptions into a single index that can be applied at a route, station, or system level. Firstly a survey is undertaken to understand passengers’ requirements for the 1LM environment, from which importance weightings are derived for its different aspects. An ","Interest is growing in the first and last mile part of the public transport journey. This acknowledges that the passenger experiences the trip from origin to destination as a whole, and that the quality of the first/last mile (1LM) part may determine the overall satisfaction with the trip. This has important implications for sustainable transport goals, as the success with which passengers are attracted to and retained on public transport modes may have little to do with the quality of the modes themselves if the rest of the journey is unattractive. This might have implications for both the effectiveness and the equity of transport systems (Boarnet et al., 2017).====At present the research on the first/last mile and its role within the transit offering is fairly thin. While a considerable amount of research on the non-motorised environment has provided robust insights into what pedestrians and bicyclists require, this has less often been extended specifically to the analysis of the first/last mile. Little is known, for instance, on whether public transport users have the same preferences for and behaviour during the off-vehicle part of a multimodal journey as for a trip entirely made on foot or by bicycle, given that trip distances, purposes, and constraints might differ significantly between the two cases. The 1LM trip may consist of several modes, and may include a feeder bus or taxi trip in addition to a walk or cycle component. This multimodality of the 1LM trip creates several methodological questions, including how to judge the quality of the 1LM experience consistently, and how to draw valid comparisons across different cases.====The paper aims to help answer these questions by suggesting a general methodology for assessing the quality of the 1LM environment, and testing it using a case study. We develop a single index that captures the average quality of a 1LM environment, and that is flexible enough to be applied at a route or precinct level. Based on the premise that it is important for the index to reflect what passengers want from various aspects of the 1LM trip, we embed in it a user-derived importance weighting, and we undertake primary research to derive this weighting from a user population. The paper thus makes a methodological contribution, as well as an empirical one. The results demonstrate how priorities for intervention in the 1LM environment can be set using the insights gained from the analysis.====The paper first provides a short overview of existing methods for measuring the quality of aspects of the first/last mile environment, including walkability and multimodal quality of service. We then introduce the proposed methodology for deriving a composite 1LM index, and describe the steps followed in implementing it. Then follows a description of the case study among rail and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) passengers in Tshwane and Johannesburg, South Africa, and the results of the experiment.

Drawing on 12 research papers and presentations and the ensuing lively discussion, three main contributions were made. Firstly, key issues in the contracting cycle were identified and critical success factors identified for different public markets, distinguished by different levels of maturity and multi-modality. Secondly, a matrix that maps contract incentives/enablers against stakeholders was developed. Thirdly, the implications of new technology were considered and the role of regulatory sandboxes highlighted.","This Workshop had the following three aims:====Overall, the Workshop intended to review the latest international evidence and assess its robustness, building on previous Thredbo workshops, most recently that reported by Merkert, Preston, Melkersson, and Link (2018). Our starting point was to consider some concepts which would frame our discussion. The first was the classification of models of competition and ownership established by Hensher and Brewer (2001) and illustrated by Fig. 1 (see also Currie, 2016). Our focus is on the contracts and franchises in the centre of the diagram, whilst recognising the path dependencies with the extremes of private deregulated and public regulated systems.====The second was the contracting cycle that has been posited at Thredbo Conferences passim (Preston & Shaw, 2000) and is illustrated by Fig. 2. The number of times a regime has been around this cycle will reflect market maturity and might be linked with the concept of regulatory cycles (to be discussed later).====The third, and final, introductory concept to frame our discussions was the use of assessment frameworks to examine contracting-out options. An example, based on a study of possible interventions in the public transport market in Great Britain outside London, developed by KPMG (2016), is shown by Fig. 3. This included ten assessment criteria: fares, ticketing, network coverage, integration, reliability, fleet quality, service quality, innovation, marketing and operating efficiency. Interventions assessed included net cost and gross cost tenders, franchising and partnerships. These are interventions that are covered by the presentations and papers of the workshop and the ensuing discussion.====In the next section we will discuss the 12 resource papers that provided the raw material for our discussions. We will then consider some key findings with respect to contract design, incentives and market dynamics. Finally, we will make some policy recommendations and future research priorities, some of which we hope will be taken up before Thredbo 17 in Japan in 2021.",Workshop 1 report: Models of mainstream public transport provision,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301220,1 September 2020,2020,Research Article,226.0

Secondly, a public policy framework is proposed, considering the policy instruments, indicative group of stakeholders responsible and the different urban mobility management decision levels.====The authors argue that is fundamental to understand the nature of decisions which are intimately connected with the Urban Mobility system, to design and implement a coherent and effective policy framework, where the policy tools chosen to materialize policy decisions regarding “MaaS” should first consider the identification of the founding pillars of the “MaaS” concept, guiding the process of policy design accordingly.====If “MaaS” is considered a Mobility Management tool, it can constitute an opportunity to redefine public transport and its financing.","With the continuous growth of the world population and rising urbanization, urban sprawl is taking up the scene of human settlements and several challenges arise consequently inside the urban mobility system. Increasing levels of congestion and its related cost, in economic, social and environmental dimensions, affect greatly the quality of life.

Accelerated advancements of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), that already changed Industrial processes and led us to Industry 4.0, are democratizing data, which is seen as the new “oil” of the XXI century.

Cyprus has initiated a few years ago the second PT reform cycle which will be concluded with the awarding of six new concession contracts for passenger services by bus. This paper presents and discusses the two PT reforms in Cyprus. The aim of the second reform is to significantly increase the PT share by improving service availability and quality through the transition from a monopolistic to a more competitive PT market. According to the roadmap prepared by the Cypriot authorities, specific contracting arrangements have been set to attract both local and international PT operators to the competitive tendering process. These arrangements mostly pertain to the eligibility and selection criteria of the tendering process, the opportunity to lease PT buses from local companies and the contract type and duration. The paper sets five main questions addressing critical issues of the reform effort and provides responses through the in-depth analysis of the selected tender and contractual arrangements. Useful findings and conclusions may be drawn, especially regarding the effect of small size market and the lack of necessary PT infrastructure.","Competitive Tendering has become in the last decade the prevailing approach for procuring Public Transport (PT) passenger services both at urban and rural/intercity level. As of December 2009, the EU Regulation 1370/07 has set the legal framework for the EU member states as to which are the eligible ways for the competent (or contracting) authorities to award passenger services' contracts by Bus/Tram or by Metro/Rail. National legislation may also apply, as long as it does not contradict the Regulation's provisions. For most cases, the way to proceed when contracting authorities need to buy PT services is to start a tendering process which is either open to economic operators or limited to those that are registered in a valid registry for this purpose. Several EU member-states had introduced this approach well before Reg. 1370/07 was put into effect (Alexandersson et al., 1998; Eerdmans et al., 2010; Mackie et al., 1995). Others, again, at their discretion and in accordance with specific clauses of the Regulation, choose to directly award contracts for passenger services to operators who are either subsidiary legal entities or they comprise a branch of the contracting authority (Beck, 2011; Van de Velde, 2008).====Cyprus, one of the newest EU member states, belongs to the group of those countries which have not implemented until recently competitive tendering in the PT market. PT passenger services in the free Cyprus==== districts are offered – as of the day this paper was prepared - by bus only. The respective contracts were directly awarded by the ====, Communications and Works (MTCW) of Cyprus in December 2009 to six (6) private operators following an institutional reform that took place in a very short period. Operations commenced in July 2010 and the duration of the contracts was set to 10 years. In view of the need for a tendering process in conformity with EU Reg. 1370/07, the MTCW initiated as of 2016 the preparation of tender documents for the award of new concession contracts for passenger services for the next ten years.====Though tender call and contract preparation for such a competition may look an ordinary business in many countries or large cities in the EU and worldwide, this was the first time that the Cypriot state and local authorities had to deal with such a project. The same also applies for all involved stakeholders and the local PT industry as well. To address several interrelated and complex issues, the MTCW decided to hire external consultants to assist the responsible department in the preparation of the tender documents based on a thorough review of the existing situation. An additional goal has been to receive recommendations about the management of the new PT concession contracts.====This specific case brings into the scene several issues of interest that merit the attention of those involved in the PT industry and research. These issues can be transformed into the following questions:====This paper investigates these issues and resulting questions through an in-depth analysis of the Cyprus case study. All main factors that had affected the crucial decisions made by the responsible contracting authority (MTCW) regarding the tender documents are being explored. One main goal is to understand the “philosophy” behind these decisions which seem to have been influenced by the past experiences of MTCW regarding the PT market and the transport sector in general. The authors' view is that the case of Cyprus has a uniqueness, when compared to other EU member state cases. This is due to the relatively small market size of the country, the institutional immaturity as far as PT aspects are concerned, the very low PT share which may be attributed to several reasons, and the fact that the government's policies during the last 20–30 years favour the use of private cars.====The paper is structured in 8 sections as follows. Following the introduction which sets the main paper objectives, Section 2 provides an overview of the case of Cyprus presenting the main socioeconomic and mobility related data. A brief description of the methodology followed for the purposes of this work is given in Section 3. Section 4 includes a bibliographic review mainly focusing on PT tendering practices and considerations as well as on lessons learnt from other cases around the world and especially from EU countries, which are relevant to the topics addressed in this work. Section 5 is devoted to the first reform cycle of the PT Institutional framework in Cyprus that took place in 2009. The second reform cycle, that is currently implemented through the new concession contracts and the road map with the different steps taken by the MTCW, is presented in Section 6. Section 7 provides an overview of the main features of the Call for Tenders and the Concession contract provisions, followed by commentaries where deemed necessary.

With a bibliometric approach, the impactful clusters of studies and research focus are identified and visualized separately. Key papers on measuring bus service quality, assessing the efficiency impacts of contract features, comparing competitive tendering with negotiation are discussed. Studies on incentive issues and alternative contract awarding mechanisms are reviewed separately in a structured manner, allowing us to extract the representative modeling frameworks and summarize the major policy implications. The survey paper would be a quick and self-contained reference to both scholars and policymakers who are interested in either modeling or evaluating bus service contracting. It is found that (i) the empirical results are mixed in terms of the impacts of incentives. Given the varying conditions of transit markets from different jurisdictions, policymakers should be cautious about the potential and the adverse impacts of incentive schemes; (ii) many research opportunities revolve around incentive contract design where the classical principal-agent framework and the optimization theory could play an important role from different perspectives; (iii) the competence and integrity of the transit authority matters in the choice of competitive tendering and negotiation. Irrespective of the awarding mechanisms, however, building trusting partnerships between the transit authority and operators is always beneficial; (iv) very few studies have investigated how contract features and managerial practices can affect bus service quality. A large variety of methods, including the discrete choice and the leader-follower framework, can be used to model the evolution of service quality perceived by riders. This can in turn promote the development of the scare but growing literature on assessing the impacts of contract awarding mechanisms on riders’ satisfaction.","Bus transit plays a critical role in facilitating urban mobility of metropolitan areas. During the 1980s when privatization and economic deregulation of the transit market was in its infancy, some local transit authorities gradually opted out of government provision and resorted to contracting out public bus services in response to limited government funding and deteriorating service quality. In 1985, the city of London first contracted out its bus services on a per-route basis by competitive tendering (CT) mechanism. Following that initiative, similar contracting practices were used in many cities around the world, especially in Europe and Oceania (Merkert et al., 2018). Since its inception, public bus service contracting has attracted considerable attention from academics, especially those in the transportation economics community. Over the past three decades, it has been one of the ongoing themes in the biennial international conference series on Competition and Ownership in Land Passenger Transport (i.e., the Thredbo series). Relevant studies have presented considerable successful and failed experiences worldwide and discussed a wide range of critical issues regarding bus service contracting. For instance, the report initiated by the European Commission presented the contracting practices of 32 cities in Europe (European Commission, 2008). Pedro and Macário (2016) provided a review of the contracting practices by covering over 50 contracts selected from 23 countries around the world. Both studies have identified a template of bus service contracting, including alternative contract awarding mechanisms (e.g., competitive tendering or negotiation), contract types (e.g., gross-cost contract, net-cost contract and management contract), incentive schemes based on bus service performance (e.g., more punctual services, less canceled departures, ridership growth, increased service frequency), contract size (e.g., network, sub-network, and route), contract design and management (e.g., asset ownerships, contract duration, renewal conditions, and key performance indicators), ownership structures of transit operators (e.g., public, private or mixed), etc. To facilitate the presentation, the implications of several important terminologies are given in Table 1.====To date, there are a few survey papers concerning the problem of public bus service contracting (e.g., Bray et al., 2018; Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2014; Pedro & Macário, 2016; Wong & Hensher, 2018). Specifically, the first study was dedicated to reviewing one single aspect of bus service contracts, i.e., the incentive structures that have been observed in Latin America's transit market. The second study has reviewed a set of general public transport contracts, including bus, subway, and tram services. It has discussed various institutional regimes, various forms of risk allocation, various kinds of awarding procedures, etc. For the last two studies, however, the primary objectives were to reflect on the development of the past Thredbo series, tracking the main concerns and solutions over the past decades in both the bus and rail sectors. This study, with a specific focus on contracting for public bus services, sets out to provide a systematic and critical review that differs from previous studies in several major aspects. First, more quantitative papers from multiple academic sources are included. The previous surveys mainly focused on reviewing and summarizing the papers and reports presented at the Thredbo series, although they have also included a few important papers published elsewhere. This study will complement the previous surveys by covering as many quantitative studies as possible from a number of international refereed journals. Second, the survey is facilitated with a bibliometric approach that can trace the footprints revealed by scholarly publications, including the citation network among publications and the co-occurrence network among keywords. Combined with certain visualization techniques, the bibliometric approach can map the landscape of the knowledge domain of bus service contracting studies, allowing us to discern the questions that have been of great interest and the critical transitions in the development of the research field. Finally, for each identified research focus, the key papers and the major elements are first extracted and discussed so that readers can quickly grasp the theoretical foundation, research methodologies, or essential ideas in each subject area. Following that, representative studies within each subject area are reviewed in a structured manner together with discussions on future research opportunities. This survey would be a quick and self-contained reference to both scholars and policymakers who are interested in either modeling or evaluating bus service contracting under different institutional contexts.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the data source and the bibliometric approach are introduced.

On the other hand, drivers receive a fixed payment with no pecuniary incentive related with their performance.====The main objective of this paper is to analyze the application of a monetary incentive for bus drivers focused on increasing the number of passengers transported to test the existence of multitasking, specifically checking the behavior of drivers regarding bus speed.====We conducted a field experiment with an operator of Transantiago and we used a ==== analysis to show that with the pecuniary incentive tested, drivers raised their transported passengers in 9% when riding in long bus routes. We found some evidence of multitasking associated with a decrease in speed of 3%. Thus, our research provides suggestive evidence that inefficiencies may be occurring in the operation because of the lack of adequate incentives for drivers.","With the arrival of Transantiago in 2007, a new contract structure between operators and the transport agency was implemented, consisting of concessions awarded through competitive tendering (Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2013). Another relevant novelty of the new system was that the drivers of the operating companies started earning a fixed salary, leaving aside the old structure that corresponded to a payment per passenger transported (Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2013; Puga, 2017; Tiznado et al., 2014). The effects of drivers’ fixed salaries were twofold: on the one hand races between buses for collecting passengers in the streets were eradicated (which was the main security problem of the old transport system), but on the other hand fixed salaries also eliminated incentives for drivers to control fare evasion and attend the demand of passengers (Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2013).====Drivers fulfill a significant task in the operational functioning of the bus system (De La Vega, 2018; Tiznado et al., 2014). They are the ones who make the decisions in situ of how to operate a bus, they have direct contact with the users, and they must know how to face the different unexpected situations of the transit of the city. The quality of service perceived by system users depends on their behavior (Gómez-Lobo & Briones, 2013). Therefore, by recognizing the importance of the driver's role in the operation of public transport buses, understanding that their behavior has a direct influence on the quality of service offered and considering that it is necessary for it to carry out various tasks during its working day, it is important to study how an incentive scheme applied to drivers may alter their behavior and thus obtain measures on its influence on bus operation.====The current concession contracts with the operating companies of Transantiago depend on five different indexes measuring quality of service. According to the fulfillment of each one, the payment and fines that will be applied to each operating company are defined. Given the above, the operating company must distribute its efforts in different aspects to ensure a minimum quality of service is established. While part of this task corresponds to the operational areas of the company, the driver has also an important role to comply with these indexes. Consequently, for the operator it is very important that the driver makes a list of tasks in addition to driving the bus. This turns the driver's workday into a job with a potential presence of multitasking elements (Holmstrom & Milgrom, 1991).====The main objective of this paper is to analyze the application of a monetary incentive for bus drivers focused on increasing the number of passengers transported to test the existence of multitasking, specifically checking the behavior of drivers regarding bus speed.====For this research, a field study will be carried out in a company operating the public transportation system, Transantiago. A monetary incentive will be applied to a group of drivers and we will proceed to measure various aspects of their behavior as a worker and as a bus operator. We used a difference in difference analysis to show that with the pecuniary incentive tested, drivers raised their transported passengers in almost 9% when driving long routes. We found some evidence of multitasking associated with a decrease in speed of 3%.====Globally, several public transport systems have implemented an operator payment scheme that depends on the number of passengers transported. For instance, Vigren and Pyddoke (2020) studied the impact on bus ridership of passenger incentive contracts in Swedish public transport. Sepúlveda and Galilea (2020) examined payment schemes related to the frequency of transport services and number of passengers transported, showing the relative importance of those incentives. Nevertheless, other payment schemes for bus operators have been studied: Hensher and Stanley (2003) and Hensher and Houghton (2004) propose a contract based on operational variables (performance based contract, PBC), taking into account reforms of public transport system done in different cities, while Rojo et al.

Another example is the work done by Gagnepain and Ivaldi (2002), recommending fixed-price contracts for better-informed regulators. Other empirical studies on public transport contracts focus on the estimation of cost functions and/or efficiency measures (Gagnepain & Ivaldi, 2002; Batarce & Galilea, 2018; Dalen & Gómez-Lobo, 2003; Avelani et al., 2016, 2018) and the analysis of subsidies for Public Transport (Börjesson et al., 2019; Basso & Jara-Díaz, 2010; Basso & Silva, 2014; among others).====However, few have analyzed the implementation of driver incentives, an exception is Hartman et al.

This is probably because most people rely heavily upon cars in those areas and only a limited proportion of residents near train stations use them. While sufficient empirical studies have not been made to persuade them, many railway lines in developed countries have been in danger of closure and quite a few of them, so far, have actually closed down in line with the recommendations of cost benefit analysis (CBA).====However, if social impact had been taken into consideration, policy decisions would have been different in some cases. In Austria, apart from cost benefit analysis, several rural regional railways have been modernized in recent years, and these seem to have had a positive impact on communities along the railway lines.

At the same time, the use of technology to facilitate access to DRT is creating circumstances for significant disruption of the way bus services are planned, contracted, delivered and regulated. This disruption creates uncertainty for bus operators but also presents an opportunity for operators to proactively adapt to better meet passenger needs and capture more of the market. This could involve diversifying their businesses, becoming total local transport providers and/or brokers, along Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) type lines, where the passenger is of central importance, rather than the mode of transport. The paper presents a Victorian case study that explores how the bus ==== voluntary professional association is working with its members to augment their capabilities and deliver DRT services, against the background of a changing contractual environment for delivery of services. The provision of a new transport business model, and the technological platform that supports it via their voluntary professional association, will enable bus operators to compete in the growing DRT realm and passenger services levels to improve, also supporting better social and environmental outcomes.","Transport is likely to undergo considerable change in the next few decades. The public transport sector will be caught up with these changes and, unless it is able to adjust and be responsive and innovative, risks becoming less relevant.

It relates to rights of either operators or authorities to design public transport networks and services. In the case of an authority initiative regime, special public bodies, the so-called public transport authorities (PTAs), specify public transport services using the knowledge of professional transport planners. In the opposite case of market initiative regimes, the development of public transport services is not prescribed by any single body or organisation; conversely, these services are developed by autonomous decisions of many commercially-driven public transport operators (PTOs).====The issues of market initiative and central planning were first recognised by Sir Edwin Chadwick, an English social reformer, who compared English and French ways of the organisation of the omnibus industry in the middle of the nineteenth century (see Chadwick, 1859, p. 390–393). However, the academic interest to this issue was not reached until the 1980s, when deregulation in Great Britain and competitive tendering in London and Scandinavian countries brought new life to the issues of public transport organisation, ownership, and competition. The current research field of public transport governance was created as a reaction to this reform initiative.====Currently, public transport services are organised in various ways worldwide. Authorities follow different approaches depending on policy goals, administrative capabilities, funding arrangements, regulatory framework, market structure, etc. These approaches can be narrowed to several types of organisational forms, e.g. as suggested by Halcrow Fox (2000, pp. 25–30), or Inno-V, RebelGroup, TØI, and TIS (2008, pp. 16–27), which are most commonly used. The first one provides nine forms, ranging from open market to public monopoly, and is considered to fit in a broad range of cases in both developing and developed countries. The second provides four organisational forms, from free market initiative with additional contracting to in-house operations, and fits best to the European environment (see, Table 1).====Both classifications are contrasting virtually the same extremes. The first one is open or free market. This form is based on a principle of market initiative to open, adjust or terminate transport services. Such systems have a poor reputation due to the disappointing results of bus deregulation in Great Britain outside London in 1986, and a lack of reliability and safety of unregulated paratransit in the developing world. However, despite well-known negative aspects, e.g. wasteful competition in the market and lack of service coordination, these systems can deliver positive results in demand responsiveness, or even client orientation and innovations in service planning and provision.====The second extreme is public monopoly, or in-house operations. This is based on public ownership, public service provision, and central planning. Furthermore, central planning can be observed in gross cost route contracting form, i.e. the so-called Scandinavian model, where strategic and tactical decisions are provided by public transport authorities, while private operators are only left with day-to-day service production (see van de Velde, 1999). The main rationale behind such systems is to provide integrated and coordinated transport systems (Gwilliam et al., 1985, p. 125–127). However, some experts underline natural lack of reach, sensation and responsiveness of bureaucracy and planning (Klein et al., 1997, p. 19), and limitations in developing passenger satisfaction and patronage without market forces (Schaaffkamp, 2014, p. 306).====The discussion around market initiative and central planning varies around the world. It is mostly considered that authorities should be preferred to act as transport planners, i.e. to directly specify transport services, or at least provide guidelines and regulations for operators. Additionally, many intermediate options between market initiative and central planning can be found. Technically speaking, even gross cost route contracting usually assumes that the final scheduling is performed by operators. In other forms, the level of market involvement may be higher. Particularly, as is the case of the Netherlands, public transport can be organised via area-based mono-operator contracts with incentives, and operators can then adjust the network, frequencies and fleet if this option is set in contract clauses. In developing countries the roles can be shared in a way that authorities specify vehicle standards in licenses, or areas of operations in concessions, or routes in franchise agreements, while the rest is decided by vehicle owners and route associations, including the capacity, frequency, hours of service, fares, etc.====Additionally, the case of hybrid regimes was recently recognised, i.e. the regimes that partly rely on one organisational form and partly on another. Usually, one form is more market-oriented, and the other is more authority-driven. In developed countries, these cases can be found in Great Britain and New Zealand, with deregulated and tendered services, in Sweden, with tendered, and a portion of market initiated services, in Germany, with commercial and non-commercial alternatives and in many other cases where public operations coexist with tendered services (Beck, 2012; van de Velde & Wallis, 2013). In a case of developing countries, hybrid regimes usually partly rely on planned formal services and on flexible, less formal minibuses (Behrens et al., 2016).====Public transport markets are constantly changing (see, Gwilliam, 2008). The phenomenon of the evolution of organisational forms was recognised in Europe at least since the 1980s, with a general trend to market liberalisation without the loss of central planning (Gwilliam & van de Velde, 1990; van de Velde, 2001). In developing countries, authorities usually follow the opposite approach, trying to recreate large formal operators, consolidate the informal sector, or implementing ‘big bang’ reforms, e.g. to introduce bus rapid transit systems and replace minibuses on major corridors (Finn, 2008; Schalekamp et al., 2016). In extreme cases authorities even try to ban minibuses completely (see a spectrum of stringency of Cervero, 2000). However, the more ambitious the plans, the more they are likely to fail. Only a limited number of such initiatives had gained success. Some of them, as the Transantiago plan introduced in Chile in 2007, which completely changed the public transport system overnight, face severe problems at the initial stage, and can achieve success only after long revision (Gómez-Lobo, 2012; Muñoz & Gschwender, 2008).====A more recent example of the private bus sector restructuring has appeared in Moscow, Russia. The so-called ‘new model of partnership with private operators’ was implemented in 2016. This reform was based on the idea to change the organisational form of private bus operations. The former system, with commercial route permits was terminated and replaced by gross cost contracts with vast service specifications. The results were highly positive in relation to service quality, as operators totally renewed their fleet, were integrated to a citywide ticketing system, and started to comply with strict monitoring and enforcement clauses of contracts. On the other hand, such reform had led to the dissatisfaction of operators and a stressful passenger experience during the first months following the reform's introduction. Also, the reform led to massive network restructuration. Nearly 500 initial urban routes, which had never been centrally planned or designed by authorities, but developed autonomously by dozens of operators since the 1990s, were replaced by 211 routes fully designed by the Government of Moscow. This case can be used to examine the nature and the differences between the principles of market initiative and central planning in network design.",Market initiative and central planning: A study of the Moscow bus network,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301177,15 August 2020,2020,Research Article,234.0

Researchers surveyed employees at two of North America's largest railroads—one in the United States and another in Canada—to anonymously record employees' current attitudes regarding women in traditionally male-dominated operations positions. These railroads agreed to participate in this study in order to help identify sources of potential employment recruitment pools and pinpoint gender-specific barriers in the workplace. This research included tracing historical challenges women have faced in becoming railroad operating employees. In addition to analyzing trends and challenges of employing women in male-dominated roles, this study considered how job vacancies should be marketed to gain the interest of potential female employees and examined how to implement best practices to promote and foster greater numbers of women in these operational roles.","In 2018, approximately 57% of women in the United States participated in the labor force compared to 69% of males.==== Women workers constituted more than half of all workers in some industry sectors, such as financial activities, education and health services, as well as leisure and hospitality. At the other end of the spectrum, some industry sectors experience limited female labor force participation. Industries with less than 30% female labor force participation included agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction, and transportation. Within transportation, aviation had the highest percentage of female employees at 41%.==== But other transportation modes, including railroads and motor carriers,==== had workforces comprised of fewer than 10% female workers. (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019).====The overwhelming majority of truck drivers or railroad track and train crews were men. Yet women were entering these types of operational jobs in increasing numbers as part of a much larger trend of females entering male-dominated industries, many in non-traditional operational roles. Examples include attorneys, veterinarians, and marketing managers. However there has been also considerable integration of females in traditional male occupations such as police officers and firefighters (Garcia, 2003; Hedreen, 2019; Luo et al., 2019; Schuck, 2014).====In an attempt to understand why some jobs are predominantly held by one gender, researchers have explored implicit gender role theories—specifically, the malleability of roles filled by women and men (Croft et al., 2015; Doeringa & Thébaud, 2017; Knutson et al., 2007; Kray et al., 2017, Lindsey, 2015; Ridgeway & Correll, 2004; Stamarski & Son Hing 2015). Within the implicit gender role theories, social role theorists contend that women's presumed communality is a result of women historically serving in home-maker roles and men serving in occupational roles, not as a result of innate characteristics of either gender (Eagly & Steffen, 1984; Eagly & Wood, 1999; Reskin & Hartmann, 1986). Enduring gender roles can lead to stereotypes which reinforce the workplace gender status quo even as the daily tasks of an occupation transition away from an emphasis upon physical strength and heavy labor (Bobbitt-Zeher, 2011; Cundiff & Vescio, 2016; Dipboye & Colella, 2005; Heilman, 2012).",Women in North American railroad operational roles: Opportunities and challenges,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301153,11 August 2020,2020,Research Article,236.0

Workshop five of the 16th International Conference on Competition and Ownership in Land ","On November 5th==== 2018, Roy Kim, a 58-year-old cab driver, was found hanging from a belt in the bathroom of his home in Queens, New York. According to the New York Times (Fitzsimmons, 2018), Roy Kim sadly became the eighth professional driver to die by suicide in New York that year. In the wake of ridesourcing applications, the price of New York taxi medallions has dropped dramatically (Song, 2018). The taxi medallions were once sold for more than $1 million and were named the best long-term investment in the United States (Badger, 2014). Accordingly, the pension plan for many New York drivers was to lease their medallions to other drivers. Due to their market value, this could generate a sufficient passive income. However, between 2013 and 2016, the medallions lost more than half of their worth (Bagchi, 2018), resulting in thousands of cab drivers in New York no longer being able to retire.====What were the regulatory failures that contributed to the collapse of the NYC taxi medallion market? Was it the failure to regulate the business practices of ridesourcing companies like Uber, who expanded rapidly into urban taxi markets by largely ignoring existing regulations on fares, vehicle standards, and driver licensing? Or was the failure the existing taxi regulation system itself, where taxi supply was controlled too tightly, inflating the value of taxi medallions and benefiting incumbents at the expense of users and potential entrants?====Workshop five of Thredbo 16 – titled ‘how much regulation should disruptive transport technologies be subject to?’ focused on improving the understanding of how the development and diffusion of disruptive transport technologies, such as ridesourcing, could be governed in order to reap potential societal benefits, while limiting unintended consequences and avoiding tragedies such as the death of Roy Kim.====The workshop, which is reported in this paper, builds on workshop seven of Thredbo 15 – the 2017 edition of the conference. That workshop discussed how Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) might influence how public transport is managed, operated, and contracted. The main recommendation for Thredbo 16 was to explore the regulation of MaaS, including “a suite of partnership issues looking at market relationships in the new mobility area of increased and pervasive digitization and the development of public/private collaborations beyond the standard procurement procedures” (Mulley & Kronsell, 2018, p. 572).====This advice was embraced by the workshop, but the scope was enlarged from focusing on (just) the regulation of MaaS to considering the governance of all disruptive transport technologies within the personal mobility domain – that is, technology powered mobility services, products, and processes that focus on corporeal travel (cf. Urry, 2007), and of which diffusion might transform current practices within the transport sector (cf. the description of disruptive innovation in Markides, 2006). Beyond MaaS, present examples of much-discussed disruptive transport technologies include autonomous vehicles (also known as driverless cars), ridesourcing (also known as ride-hailing and transport network company services), micro-mobility (e.g., electric scooter sharing systems), drones, and hyperloops. In the event, the workshop papers were heavily focused on ridesourcing and autonomous vehicles, reflecting the extent to which these technologies have penetrated major transport markets or raised novel regulatory questions, respectively. Moreover, one paper addressed the introduction of MaaS. The other technologies will no doubt be covered in future research.====The papers that were presented during the workshop are summarized in Section 2.

Therefore, to analyze the impacts of the introduction of Jongro-gu MBL in January 2018, an effect analysis using the speed and volume of passenger cars and buses in Seoul is conducted in this study. The interpretation of the Downs-Thomson (D-T) paradox demonstrates that the reduction in passenger car mode capacity can increase total social benefits. This study shows that the speeds of passenger cars and buses have reached the deterministic user equilibrium after the MBL introduction, resulting in an increase in total social benefits. Moreover, it demonstrates that the bus priority policies, which gives the right to keep the capacity of buses guaranteed in urban areas, will be effective. The interpretation of the D-T paradox will contribute to the formulation of transport demand ====.","Along with the recent economic growth and rapid urbanization, a number of problems have emerged, among which those related to vehicular traffic is considered the most severe and complicated. These problems include the saturation caused by the rise in traffic hours, the drop in the quality of traffic service, and the increase in environmental concerns caused by congestion and transport emissions. They result from the low road capacity compared to the number of vehicles in circulation; however, the limit set by the Seoul Metropolitan Government has been reached in this regard. In order to overcome the foregoing and maximize road efficiency, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has implemented transportation demand management policies, such as bus priority policy through the MBL, odd-even rule, parking management policy, ramp metering, and congestion pricing in Namsan Tunnel.====In January 2018, a 121.1 km MBL was implemented in Jongno-gu, from Sejong-ro intersection to Dongdaemun rotary. The MBL is a policy that converts a specific road from a multi-mode usage into a bus-only lane with the objective of promoting public transportation (Currie, G., 2005). Since the implementation of this policy in different parts of the world, as one of the travel demand management (TDM) strategies, many effect analysis studies have been conducted at various levels. Cerbero, R. (2013) examined the state of MBL adoption at the international level and performed several analyses on MBL effects in terms of bus operation speed, comfort, safety, environmental impact, and social equity. Deng, T. and Nelson, J. D. (2013) analyzed the operational efficiency of introducing the MBL and the resulting speed improvement. In Korea, Kim, M. S. (2013) estimated the utility of the modal split by surveying MBL introduction, and then analyzed the increase in average bus speed through microanalysis research based on the estimated extent of mode transformation.====Based on the literature review of the MBL effect analysis in Korea and internationally, it is found that bus speed and regularity in the schedule are mainly affected. The impact of MBL on other transportation modes, however, has not yet been seriously discussed; consequently, the real MBL impact on transportation as a whole could not be evaluated. This problem is mainly caused by the limitations in data collection (speed and traffic volume), especially the one related to private cars. For a more accurate evaluation, the effect analysis should include all modes of transport because roads are generally used by more than one mode, e.g., passenger cars and buses.====If the road capacity is only allocated to buses, then an effect analysis on bus service will be extremely beneficial. This reduction in allocated capacity, however, can affect the private car mode by aggravating congestion and increasing the total traffic cost. Improving the volume and speed of public transport contributes to the increase in public transportation demand and a decrease in private car demand. This improvement can thus reduce the total transportation cost as a whole, as D-T paradox phenomenon can demonstrate.====The D-T paradox argues that the average speed of a car on a road network is determined by the average speed of public transportation traveling the same distance. In other words, increasing the number of roads could worsen the traffic situation (Down, 1962; Thomson, 1977). Mogridge and Martin J. H. (1990) empirically demonstrated Thomson's claim by comparing the speed of passenger cars and public transport. Abraham, J. E., and Hunt, J. D. (2001) verified the paradox using Gumbel distribution and showed that the interval between buses increases with the road capacity.====Wang, W. et al. (2017), on the other hand, investigated how to maintain the total social benefit from the entire road. In fact, bus companies can employ two approaches to increase the benefit that accrues to them— they could reduce the operational cost by decreasing the bus frequency and number, or they could increase the number of bus users (Zhang et al., 2016). The frequency reduction strategy, however, usually leads to a decline in bus service, thereby a decrease in bus users and an increase in private car users. Wang, W. et al. (2017) concluded that governments should provide incentives to private companies to maintain the total social benefit. Zhang, F. et al. (2014) identified approaches to reduce the growth in the number of passenger cars and maintain total benefits by introducing demand–response buses. An analysis of whether the changes in bus fares by government control are effective in expanding road capacity is conducted, proving that paradoxes can only occur when private cars and buses are completely substituted. Finally, Lee, S. et al. (2010) demonstrated the user balance based on bus speed and analyzed the effects of securing bus frequency resulting from MBL introduction.====Based on the literature review on the D-T paradox, at the local and international level, the optimization points where paradoxes do not occur because of changes in road capacity are theoretically verified. Moreover, the effect of MBL introduction on bus speed is analyzed. The most remarkable feature of previous studies is that for the MBL and D-T paradox, “bus speed” and “car speed” are theoretically assumed because of difficulties in obtaining data. Different from previous works, however, the analysis in this study considers speed and traffic volume through data acquisition.====By interpreting the D-T paradox in this research, it is found that the changes in traffic volume and speed for all modes caused by the introduction of the 2.8 km central bus-only lane (as MBL) in Jongno on January 2018 have contributed to the increase in total social benefits despite the road capacity reduction, and have reached the deterministic user equilibrium. Indeed studies proved that the TDM policy will be effective when implemented in the city's downtown area. Furthermore, the bus only-lane policy is expected to aid in improving the efficiency of the TDM policy, as it contributes to the reduction in the demand for cars in the future.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses the effect analysis of the MBL introduction considering the D-T paradox. Section 2 describes the research methodology and application of the D-T paradox. Section 3 presents the statistical proof that the critical user equilibrium based on the traffic volume and speed of both cars and buses has been reached through the introduction of Jongno MBL. The interpretation of the results and D-T paradox to analyze the increase in the total social benefits gained from policy implementation is also explained in this chapter.

Going well beyond big data and regulatory issues, we also examine how new and emerging business models, leveraging on advances in digital technology, can enable more efficient, consumer centric and viable transport provision. One popular emerging solution is mobility as a service (MaaS), and we discuss both tension and partnership potential among government, operators and service providers. New disruptive models and market entrants as well as definitions of success, changing customer expectations, scalability of business models and the role of asset ownership are also shown in various case studies to shape the nature of future transportation ecosystems.","The real-time optimisation of the movement of goods and people is a rapidly growing trend enabled by smart devices and big data. The ubiquity of the smartphone has enabled instantaneous sharing of location information and a multitude of mobility as a service (MaaS) solutions (see for example, Merkert et al., 2020). Big data also allow the development of a very detailed profile of customer preferences, enabling myriad bespoke combinations of services, including, but not necessarily limited to transport provision, to be packaged to the end-user. Such abilities have given rise to emerging business models that could greatly transform the transportation sector, both private and public. This transformative potential has spurred companies ranging from app developers to car manufacturers, to invest in this new mobility space. This creates both opportunities and challenges for governments and mainstream operators. On the one hand, such technologies enable real-time and dynamic feedback, presenting opportunities for operators and authorities to shape behaviour using data and real-time optimisation of travel plans. On the other hand, such innovation is often driven by the private sector, and some might say venture capitalists, which begs the question of how this space should be governed, for example in policies encouraging the growth of novel solutions and in the need for an optimal public-private integration framework to achieve better societal outcomes.====This paper provides a synthesis and systematic overview of the outcomes of the workshop ==== as part of the 2019 ====th ==== (known as the Thredbo series). In many ways, this workshop had its genesis at Thredbo 15 (2017 in Stockholm, Sweden), with its dedicated workshops on the “‘uberisation’ of public transport” (Yap & Munizaga, 2018) as well as “big spatial data and data analytics in the digital age” (Mulley & Kronsell, 2018). These workshops noted that the main challenge in implementing big data-related solutions was institutional rather than technical, and new market entrants and models of service provision resulted in both tensions and partnership opportunities amongst government, operators and service providers. This demonstrates the currency of Thredbo themes as a 30 years old conference with its traditional focus on public transport contracts and institutional reform continually evolving to adapt as shown by the discussions and outcome of this present workshop on emerging business models.====One overarching theme is governments’ growing appetite to think beyond standard procurement procedures with growing pressures on the public purse, technological advancements and the desire to improve customer service. There is an increasing desire to bring together the best elements of competitive tendering and economic deregulation, such as innovation. There is also the challenge of regulating the many transportation network companies (TNCs) which have entered the fray in recent years, and to ensure that their presence is consistent with societal objectives that go beyond the current lack of profitability (and hence long term commercial viability) despite their often very significant stock market valuations. The development of the mobility as a service (MaaS) proposition is also a hot topic, including ways to develop this through new business models and new contract specifications. The role that technology plays to enable this new state of affairs (as well as the risks that they might entail) is another topical issue. These trends and ideas form the motivation behind the development of this workshop.====The workshop consisted of 17 participants (plus a chair and rapporteur) representing seven countries and a range of stakeholders including academia, government, operator, industry association, consultancy and media (see Appendix for a list of participants and affiliations). A total of 12 technical papers were presented, each accompanied by in-depth discussions with the whole workshop. The main focus of the workshop was moderated discussions on theory and practice around the workshop theme, followed by a co-creation process to develop research, managerial and policy recommendations, including informing the agenda for Thredbo 17 in 2021, all of which we will summarise below. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the twelve presented papers grouped under three broad topics of interest. Section 3 synthesises the workshop discussions held during the three days, categorised under key topic questions. Section 4 proposes a research and policy agenda, identifying existing knowledge gaps, recommendations for government and governance, and helping to inform future Thredbo discussions. Finally, Section 5 concludes by taking a broader view on how business models and transport ecosystems relate to wider transport and societal objectives.",Emerging business models and implications for the transport ecosystem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920301098,5 August 2020,2020,Research Article,239.0

By contrast, congestion charging is rare. One reason may be that the science of climate change has become virtually impossible to ignore. Another is that GHG concentrations are cumulative, and the consequences of climate change are global, irreversible and potentially catastrophic. Traffic congestion is localized and transient, and more of an inconvenience than a threat to life. Responsibility for transportation policy is also often divided across multiple levels of government. These differences may explain why the use of economic instruments has been more widespread in dealing with climate change than with congestion.","Economists have influenced policy and practice concerning many topics in a range of fields.==== Practical problems have even motivated theoretical developments in economics (Crew & Kleindorfer, 2002). Many economists believe that the economics profession has had a major impact on the economy in general. Yet Frey (2006) claims that empirical evidence to support this is scarce, and he quotes a number of famous economists who wrote both for and against the proposition that economists have been influential. A number of scholars think that, in many cases, economists have not had as much impact as they may have anticipated, or hoped. A case in point are externalities which economists have been studying since Pigou (1920). Extensive bodies of work in environmental economics and transportation economics have accumulated since the 1950s. Politicians and policy makers, however, have been slow to adopt economists’ advice despite advances in economic science, large increases in the costs of congestion and pollution, and increased recognition of the threat posed by climate change.====In this paper we consider economists’ advice regarding market-based instruments (i.e., pricing and tradable permits) to address externalities. To assess how influential economists have been, we focus on two specific cases: climate change — a global environmental externality, and traffic congestion — a local transportation externality. Road transportation creates externalities other than congestion. It is responsible for about 20% of global CO==== emissions, and it generates other pollutants (e.g., CO, NOX, volatile organic compounds and particulates) that have both local and regional impacts. For two reasons, we do not examine these environmental effects of transportation in depth. First, our review of climate-change policies is general and does not single out particular economic sectors. Second, we restrict attention to instances where economic advice has been promulgated for several decades, and also followed to some extent. This approach allows us to assess how closely practice adheres to advice. Road pricing has almost never been implemented to reduce vehicle emissions.==== To date, the main instrument has been regulation. As we note in Section 2, most advances in reducing automobile pollution have been technological rather than economic-based. Furthermore, tradable permits have not yet been used to control road transportation.====Thus, the scope of the article is limited to congestion pricing of roads, and taxes and tradable permits for greenhouse gas emissions. We ask why most existing tolls are not closely related to the marginal social costs of driving, and why congestion pricing is still uncommon. We review the literature on how economists have influenced policy making in general, as well as environmental policy specifically — where economic influence has been somewhat greater than with traffic congestion.====Such an enquiry is useful for two reasons. First, measuring transportation and environmental externalities, and deciding how best to address them, requires expertise in a number of disciplines and economics has much to offer. If economic ideas are ignored, then either externalities may go largely unchecked or valuable resources may be wasted in pursuing less effective policies (Common, 1989). Second, it is important to understand the causal chain along which economics can influence policy. What sort of models do economists use to study transportation and environmental externalities? Do economists agree on what constitutes good policy? How do they present their research findings or recommendations? Do policy makers heed the research, and do they actually use it when formulating policies? How does the public react to policy proposals? What policies do eventually get implemented? Finally, are these policies later modified in a substantial way, and if so is it in a direction that accords more closely with economic reasoning? All these links in the causal chain are relevant in deciding whether and how to conduct policy-oriented research on externalities, or indeed many other subjects. We do not systematically explore every link although we touch on most of them.====Assessing the influence of economics on policy is a challenging task in general, and externalities are no exception. Nevertheless, we attempt to draw a few tentative conclusions as to why economists have had only limited success. First, over the 60+ years since concerted economic research on externalities began, substantial changes have occurred in technology, in concerns about the environment, and in what people consider to be fundamental rights. To a degree, economists have been chasing a moving target. Second, economists are not unanimous in what they consider to be the best policies. Many transportation economists adhere to the view that the price of travel should reflect marginal social costs, but some do not. Third, economists’ views differ, sometimes sharply, from those of planners, policy makers, politicians and the public —especially regarding equity. It is now widely acknowledged that economists need to pay more attention to the distributional effects of road pricing and other policies.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recaps the instruments that economists have recommended for internalizing environmental and traffic congestion externalities. Section 3 reviews the policies currently in place. Section 4 summarizes the limited evidence on economists’ influence on policy. Section 5 lists the practical difficulties in implementing environmental and transportation policies. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the findings and concludes.",Addressing transportation and environmental externalities with economics: Are policy makers listening?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300706,4 August 2020,2020,Research Article,240.0

These studies provide an insight into variations of efficiency levels for different entities (e.g. country or company comparisons). As such they can be used to identify strategies for improvement at company level as well as broader policy measures. This paper will focus on the so-called frontier-based methods covering both parametric (e.g. Stochastic Frontier Analysis) and non-parametric (e.g. Data Envelopment Analysis) methods. It will set out main challenges in applying these methods in the railway sector as well as highlighting key findings according to the studies undertaken to date. Moreover, the paper will discuss issues from methodological and empirical perspectives which would need to be addressed in future research.","This article has two main fields of interest: efficiency measurement models and railways. Efficiency measurement models within the area of production theory and production functions are directed to indicate whether and to what extent producers’ performance differ from what should be expected. The importance of such information is stressed by Fried, Lovell and Schmidt (1993, p. vii):====“Assuming that high levels of economic efficiency and productivity, and high rates of productivity growth, are desirable goals, then it is important to define and measure efficiency and productivity in ways that respect economic theory and provide useful information to managers and policy makers”.====Applying methods with a clear basis in economic theory, such as the efficiency measurement models to the railway sector is interesting due to the special position railways have in relation to economic analysis. For example, the railway sector is characterized by several market failures, e.g. natural monopoly linked to infrastructure provision and, network externalities, economies of density, scale and scope linked to the provision of railway services (see e.g. Di Pietrantonio and Pelkmans (2004)). Considering the importance that is being assigned to railways as the key to improve the sustainability of the transport system its competitiveness would be critical to achieve this objective (see e.g. the latest European Commission Transport White Paper, European Commission (2011)). Railway competitiveness is closely linked to various efficiency and productivity drivers along with other factors, e.g. the extent to which a level playing field exist between modes. As such efficiency analysis can enhance the available knowledge about what factors cause inefficiency in the railway sector and how efficiency can be improved over time. This type of information would be of relevance to railway operators as well as public authorities in order to support forward looking initiatives.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will give the background and context to efficiency analyses. The following section (Section 3) will describe the frontier based efficiency analysis.

Consequently, a type of waiting time cost is introduced, as passengers must wait for (at least) another full headway before the next service arrives. This waiting time has, to a lesser extent, been accounted for in the literature focusing on the optimal frequency of departures in transport. Not including this waiting time cost may lead to an underestimation of the optimal departure frequency. In this paper, we develop a novel optimization framework to incorporate the effect of this waiting time when there is a limited vessel capacity. Two different formulations are applied, which yield consistent results. Our policy recommendation is clear: Both the theoretical and empirical findings suggests that a “third” waiting time component of not being able to board the first vessel is highly relevant for decision-makers when vessel size constraints exists. Not including the extra waiting time costs stemming from capacity constraints leads to starkly different optimal service levels, which clearly indicates the relevance of our findings for practical policy making.","Decision-makers that control, provide and subsidize the level of services offered by public transport agencies require tools for estimating the optimal level of services to be offered by the transport agents before selecting the agency that offers the best solution. One particular tool that is needed by decision-makers is one that is used to determine the best/optimal frequency. Such a tool must be able to account for all the factors that impact the costs and benefits for operators and users such that the option with the greatest positive difference between net benefits and net costs is chosen.====Waiting time is an important cost element for transit users that must be addressed adequately by optimizing the departure frequencies in any given public transport circumstance. Time is readily evaluated in monetary terms, and when public transport system users are not able to depart at their preferred time due to an inappropriate departure frequency and/or capacity limitations, they incur losses that must be accounted for.====There is, however, an additional type of waiting time that has not been appropriately considered in the literature when designing the optimal departure frequency for public transport, at least in car ferry transport. When there are capacity constraints on a public transport link, some travelers may not be able to board the first vessel they desire. Consequently, those travelers who are not able to board must wait until the next vessel arrives, which is a cost that must be accounted for when designing the optimal frequency. Next, even if this waiting time cost was accounted for, the frequency would need to be increased to reduce it and increasing the frequency may also increase the capacity. Thus, accounting for this type of waiting time requires a framework that can help decision-makers to properly account for the waiting time cost and capacity increases, such that the optimal frequency provision can be reached. In the case of Norwegian ferries, at approximately 58% of the links,==== more than 1% of the vehicles waiting to board the ferries are not able to board the first arriving vessel, as a yearly average. Of these links, the proportion of vehicles that have to wait until the next vessel arrives is 3%, as a yearly average,==== indicating that some users indeed experience extraordinary waiting times.====The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to determine a socially optimal frequency at a ferry crossing when we include the users' time costs when they are unable to board their desired departure. Consequently, we develop a frequency optimization procedure that incorporates the abovementioned waiting time while accounting for the increased sailing cost. To the best of our knowledge, the method that we present is new to the literature, at least in the car ferry sector, although it builds on the framework of Mohring (1972) and Jaria-Diaz & Gschwender (2003). As will be shown later on, Mohring (1972) is a special case in our framework, in which infinite capacity is assumed.====Furthermore, we develop and compare two different optimization problems that depend on the assumption underlying the arrival time, i.e., (i) users arrive randomly and (ii) users plan their arrivals at the quay. Development of these problems is also a contribution to the literature.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 briefly outlines Mohring (1972)'s classic model. Section 4 presents our model formulations.

Different stakeholders may order “their own” appraisals of a specific project, which sometimes conclude quite differently from the other appraisals. This phenomenon is explored by studying the appraisals performed on eight Norwegian public-investment projects. Each of the projects analysed have been subject to many appraisals, which have all been compared and analysed. The following research questions have been explored: (1) How may various appraisals of the same project differ? (2) How may clients be able to influence the results of the appraisals? (3) How may the challenge with differing results, technical bias and low transparency of the appraisals be addressed in order to help decision-makers evaluate the various outcomes of CBAs? The findings show that the appraisals did vary in the projects studied; for some of them, quite substantially. The differences between appraisals were mostly related to the benefit side of the projects, both regarding which types of benefits were quantified and how they were measured and monetised. Important project-specific assumptions also differed among the appraisals. The findings indicate that the clients ordering the appraisals may have impacted the outcome of the appraisals by, for example, impacting project specific assumptions and demanding certain methodologies and standards to be used when quantifying and valuing benefits. A CBA can never be a complete, objective description of the matters under consideration. However, it is crucial that the appraisals are transparent and report on important factors that have large impact on the results so that decision-makers can evaluate the various appraisals and are able to use the information from them in decision-making processes.","A project appraisal can be defined as the process of assessing, in a structured way, the viability of a project (Filicetti, 2016). Societal resources are scarce. It is therefore necessary to employ methods to analyse and compare possible outcomes of alternative uses of resources in order to be able to choose the alternative that better corresponds to the stated political objectives. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is such a tool (Mishan & Quah, 2007). This article is concerned with the application of CBA in public-investment projects.====In Norway, as in many other countries, it is common practice to undertake CBA in large public projects. In its strategy, the Norwegian government has stated that the results of the CBAs should play an important role in the resource allocation to various public projects (NTP, 2017). However, literature has revealed that it is unclear what role CBAs really play in the decision-making process, and that there may be factors other than net social benefits for society that are emphasised (see e.g. Fiva & Halse, 2016; Hanssen & Jørgensen, 2015; Odeck, 1996; Odeck, 2010; Sager, 2016). There seems to be a mismatch between the stated wish to use CBAs in the decision-making process and their actual use.====The aim of this paper is to contribute with knowledge that may explain this mismatch by exploring a phenomenon seen in studies of single projects (see e.g., Kvalheim, 2015b), that of different CBAs performed on the same project varying widely in their conclusions – sometimes in opposite directions. One appraisal may conclude that a specific project has net positive social benefits, while another may reject the same project, deeming it not profitable to society. This may occur even though the analyses are conducted by respected research teams with high levels of competence in the CBA field. The first research question explored is thus:====The results of Kvalheim's (2015b) study indicated that the clients who order the appraisals may influence their results, causing technical bias in the appraisals. Technical bias may result from strategic design or manipulation of CBAs to achieve the desired outcome by cherry-picking data that supports a desired conclusion or errors of judgment under uncertainty (Parkhurst, 2017). The study by Kvalheim (2015b) was based on a single case. In this paper we expand the number of case projects and explore the research question:====For decision-makers it can be confusing when the results of the CBAs differ so much when these are to be used in the decision-making processes for the ranking of projects that are competing for resources. This invites them to question the reasons for the variation, but how are they able to evaluate the CBAs considering the high level of technicality in the methodologies and comprehensiveness of the analyses? A second study by Kvalheim (2015a) found several shortcomings in appraisal reports affecting the availability of the results to their various types of readers. Among others, several of the reports studied lacked a description of important assumptions and uncertainties both in their summaries, which are often the only part of the appraisal read by decision-makers, and elsewhere in the reports. In addition, the various consequences were often summed up without providing detailed descriptions of each component's contribution. All this may contribute towards undermining the legitimacy of the CBAs as a decision-making tool – as indicated by the informants in Kvalheim's (2015a) study, who expressed that the understanding of and trust in the reports among decision-makers was, in general, low.====A challenge arises when appraisals differ in results and clients are able to influence the results, while at the same time it is difficult for decision-makers to evaluate the results of the appraisals. This reduces the legitimacy of the outcome of the CBAs and makes it difficult to use them in decision-making processes. The third research question thus explores:====The research questions are explored by conducting an in-depth study of appraisals conducted in eight large public-investment projects in Norway.====The article is structured as follows. In section 2, a short introduction to the CBA framework is given along with a discussion of CBA as decision-making tool, including some critique against it.

By linking together and increasing the size of labour markets, the matching between individuals and jobs is improved, and the productivity increases. Communities and municipalities lobby for investments that lead to higher accessibility and those that are successful often see inflows of people as a consequence. This paper looks at the entire Swedish railway network, at the level of service of each station and at the connectivity among stations during the morning peak hour, considering different time bands. Associations between job accessibility levels and socio-demographic features are explored and disclosed, looking at the longitudinal impacts of railway investments over 4 years (from 2011 to 2014) on annual wages. Estimating a ","One of the reasons that motivates transport infrastructure and service improvements is that they are supposed to promote overall economic development, essentially by reducing transport costs (time and/or distances) and increasing accessibility levels (Deng, 2013). In turn, this may enable redistribution of employment, as access is opened to opportunities located in other places (Knowles & Ferbrache, 2016). It may also entail the creation of new jobs, and the decision of some workers to cover longer distances while maintaining similar commuting times, indirectly improving labour market productivity and expansion (Pooley et al., 2005).====The concept of accessibility can be expressed as a measure of potential opportunities (Hansen, 1959). Which are these opportunities, and how they can be reached, is a peculiarity of each studied context; accordingly, several ways to compute accessibility are possible, and a variety measures can be used (Bhat et al., 2002). However, the parameters included in the final indicators mainly refer to travel times, travel costs, travel distances, contour measures, accessible regions, and/or potential accessibility (Cheng et al., 2014; Coto-Millán et al., 2007; Geurs & Van Wee, 2004; Gutiérrez, 2001; Gutiérrez et al., 1996).====In this study, we are looking at job opportunities in Sweden within three different travel time bands: 30, 45 and 60 min. As mentioned above, job accessibility is a proxy for economic opportunities and a component that can enable understanding of underlying social dynamics that may explain (or support) previous (or future) transport infrastructure investments. Previous research has dealt with these issues. For instance, the studies of Cheng and Bertolini (2013), Le Vine et al. (2013), Chen et al. (2014), Lin et al. (2014), Karou and Hull (2014), Wang and Chen (2015) review different job accessibility concepts, together with their calculations. These are examples in which potential jobs located within a certain travel time/distance, and the transportation impedance, are the two main factors that have been taken into account to assess job accessibility.====The purpose of this paper is to investigate the longitudinal association between job accessibility through the railway network and annual wages in Sweden. In the early 1990s, a government inquiry for improved productivity in Sweden stressed the importance of better accessibility so as to improve matching on the labour market (SOU, 1991, p. 82). Likewise, another inquiry motivated substantial investments in the railway network in the Malmö region in south Sweden on the grounds that it had the potential to widen the labour market (SOU 1992:114). A potential wage increment has been one of the reasons given to support expansion projects of the railway network in the country.====We take into account the population that lives nearby railway stations while controlling for socioeconomic factors and focus on the Swedish railway network to analyse jobs opportunities. Previous studies indicate that the accessibility of a railway station can be a factor in determining if the train is chosen as transport alternative or not (Hine & Scott, 2000; Wardman & Tyler, 2000). In other words, if a worker resides near a railway station and potential jobs are located close to other railway stations connected through the network, chances are that rail will be the preferred/selected transport mode.====The method used in this paper builds on outcomes and discussions of the Thredbo 15 conference (Venter and Leong, 2018), which identified a need for more longitudinal studies in this context. Our ambition is that this preliminary study could be the first of a series of more extended and detailed investigations, relevant to transport planners in order assist them in assessing and predicting effects of future railway measures to be developed on the Swedish territory.====To assess the impact of changes in accessibility through the rail network, we compare the Swedish railway network over the years 2011–2014 with a counterfactual railway network that is fixed on its 2011-level. The purpose is to shed light on how many jobs that have been made accessible via the changes in railway services, above the changes in accessibility that result from job relocations. Also, we compare the factual and counterfactual networks to investigate the association between job accessibility and wages.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes material and methods, introducing the Swedish railway network, the data sources that have been used, and an outline of the followed approach. Section 3 presents theory, calculations and data description, leading to Section 4 where the actual results are provided, followed by a discussion.

The discussions in this Workshop extended discussions from a number of earlier Thredbo themes on better service delivery through modal integration by consideration of different transport modes as well as contributing additional case studies providing detailed evidence on factors influencing integration.====Whilst it is acknowledged that there are different levels of integration, which is dealt with in more detail below, it is clear that there are aspects of physical, organisation and data integration that transport planners need to consider rather than being myopically concerned with a specific mode. The workshop was planned to continue the discussion on identifying and designing opportunities for integration, as well as the methods for managing the engagement required for buy-in. This includes the practicalities of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) pilots or implementations but not their business models (see Workshop 3). In particular, the Workshop explored opportunities for first mile and last mile connectivity as a way to expand the potential catchment of public transport. Related to this, the Workshop explored some of the recent experiences in relation to sharing, recognising the fast adoption of micro mobility vehicles such as e-bikes and e-scooters provide different options to expand public transport reach.====The Workshop had 17 participants who attended all the Workshop sessions of whom 13 were academics (including students), three were from Government or planning and one representative from consultancies.

The previous workshop had established a recommended formula for setting public transport fares and suggested focusing on land value and road pricing as a means of funding any gap. The primary focus of this workshop was set as going further with a discussion of more innovative ways of funding the transport network through various forms of non-fare revenue and of extracting non-fare revenue to fund the public transport system. This needs to involve an examination of the social, economic and business contexts that determine the success of various non-fare revenue models.====A number of the papers presented at the Workshop provided good examples of this approach examining specific funding instruments, particularly land value capture. This issue also relates to the issue of measuring and capturing the wider economic impacts of transport projects dealt with in Workshop 7. However, the discussion in Workshop 8 went much further recognising the importance of a more comprehensive view of issues relating to a sustainable transport service.

Based on an experimental case study two on-demand scenarios were developed for the Swiss rural area of the Töss Valley. Scenario 1 replaces the current public transportation by SAVs; scenario 2 operates with a SAV fleet instead of buses and integrates the regional railway. Data sources are an overall traffic model and the current business figures of the public transportation. The results suggest that scenario 2 is, out of an economic and traffic system view, an attractive solution compared to line-bound traditional bus and train systems. In both scenarios, a cost-covering service may be possible due to an ==== and demand. Regarding the present regulatory context of the Swiss public transportation system, we propose to change the system of call for tenders for single public transportation lines towards a call for tender for entire regions. This paper contributes to the scholarship discussion on the role of the final provider of new services and which adaptions of current regulations have to be targeted in the future.","Autonomous vehicles may help to reduce traffic congestion as well as accidents and may influence travel behaviour (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). Fully autonomous vehicles (level 5==== after the taxonomy of: SAE, 2016) are expected to be cheaper (Bösch, Ciari, & Axhausen, 2016) and more sustainable (Brown, Gonder, & Repac, 2014, pp. 137–153) than traditional transportation modes. At the same time, the increase in comfort and the possibility to use the travel time as productive time could inverse the positive aspects of the autonomous vehicles into negative effects: the higher comfort may lead to an increase in the vehicle usage and the vehicle kilometres travelled (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). Those different views on possible impacts of autonomous vehicles show that transportation planning should take into consideration different scenarios of the usage of autonomous vehicles in order to provide a sustainable public and private transportation system in the future.====According to the authors' reading of literature, studies on the implementation of autonomous vehicles in the public and private transportation system show a high concentration on urban areas (e.g. Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; ITF, 2015; Spieser et al., 2014) and are often calculated on agent-based simulations (e.g. Bischoff & Maciejewski, 2016; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Heilig, Hilgert, Mallig, Kagerbauer, & Vortisch, 2017; Hörl, 2017; Hyland & Mahmassani, 2018). At the same time, a study conducted by Meyer, Becker, Bösch, and Axhausen (2017) predicts that rural public transportation can profit more from Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) than urban areas. The reason can be found in the high public transportation coverage in urban areas whereas in rural areas public transportation can only be provided on minimal scale due to low population density and low demand. At the moment, there is a difference in the reliance and the attitude of the population in urban and rural areas regarding the public transportation system (Gray, Farrington, & Kagermeier, 2008, pp. 102–119).====During the last few years, new on-demand mobility services based on smart-phone apps like Uber, DidiChuxing or Lime experienced a rapid growth. However, ridehailing services were implemented faster than the regulator could respond to the market entry. In order to protect the local taxi market, some regulators prohibited the provision of ridehailing services, whereas in other regions their market entry was facilitated. The regulation of ridehailing services shows that the entry of new players in the mobility sector can depend on the regulators’ view on the implications of a new service on the entire transportation system (Deighton-Smith, 2018). For instance, a study conducted by Hörl, Becker, Dubernet, and Axhausen (2019) in an urban context shows the importance in regulating the usage of privately owned autonomous vehicles as they could lead to an increase of 40% in the total vehicle kilometres travelled. Another scenario with the service provision by autonomous and pooled taxis shows in lower increase of 25% in the total vehicle kilometres travelled.====In this current paper, we will concentrate on the discussion on the regulation of the usage of SAVs in a public transportation system in the rural context of the Töss Valley region in Switzerland. We will present the current regulatory context and then make first predictions on how the regulation of different SAV scenarios could look like in the future. The paper will focus on a public transportation system in a Swiss rural area. By defining two different scenarios of changes in the public transportation system with the entry of autonomous vehicles, we simulate the possible effects of an on-demand and door-to-door SAV service on the public transportation system in the research perimeter of the Töss Valley. Assessing the different possible scenarios then helps to discuss the regulatory context of the proposed services. The authors want to open up the discussion on how the regulator may react on the usage of SAVs in the public transportation system, operating on-demand. Different from many agent-based simulations, we focus on the overall system of the public transportation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the current regulation context of the public transportation in Switzerland. Section 3 discusses the research context, the methods of the simulation as well as the assumptions behind the two scenarios.

Competition in procurement often leads to efficiency but the process can also raise some problems. While providing the procurement documents you do not know who will be your upcoming partner. Another aspect is how flexibility can be managed in contract design while maintaining a high service quality. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, the aim is to investigate how flexibility has been expressed and historically described in bus tendering documents. Secondly, to explore how the actors define or describe flexibility and its importance in tendering. Data was collected from ten years of tendering documents in the bus sector in Sweden and from interviews and a workshop. The results showed that flexibility in tendering documents has been and still is low for the operators. However, the actors wish for more flexibility and new forms of contracts can make it easier to include higher degrees of flexibility in future contracts. The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about how to design contracts and to manage flexibility. The study has potential to create knowledge and contribute to better decision making for future procurement of bus transport.","Contracting out and public procurement are important issues that can be seen as management tools in an organisation. There are many benefits by using public procurement as a management tool, but it is also associated with disadvantages. For example, not knowing your business partner, managing a project into the future, scope of the business, changes in the business and changes and development in services are some challenges identified. Another issue is flexibility in contracts and how flexibility can be managed or allowed in contract design in order to still have a service of high standard, and with good quality. Therefore, designing the contract becomes vital in order to allow flexibility as well as monitoring the same when services are publicly procured. In public transport in Sweden, the service is publicly procured. The specifications submitted by the public transport authorities (PTAs) are currently very comprehensive and detailed (Lidestam, Camén, & Lidestam, 2018). Previous research has showed that detailed specifications can restrict flexibility, not just in the design of the contracts, but also when performing the services (Camén, 2011).====In bus contracts, the degree of specifications varies when it comes to, for example, interior and exterior requirements of the buses as well as environmental requirements (see for example Lidestam, 2013) regarding the levels of details in contracts on the Swedish market. Flexibility in bus contracts concerns the freedom of the operators, for example, in terms of timetables and choice of bus size on different routes. Flexibility for operators should not be increased in general, but instead linked to relevant areas where policy goals can be met (van de Velde, Veeneman, & Lutje Schipholt, 2008). Flexibility in designing contracts can be used as a strategy or management tool to reduce costs, as costs of public transport in Sweden have recently increased (Camèn & Lidestam, 2016). On the other hand; too much flexibility can contribute to more risks for the PTA and thereby lead to higher costs in the end. Thus, it is often a trade-off regarding the degree of freedom in the contracts. The aim of this paper is, firstly, to investigate how flexibility has been expressed and described historically in bus tendering documents. Secondly, to explore how the actors define or describe flexibility and its importance in tendering.

To meet the needs of people and businesses, city planners must balance competing demands for limited urban space and provide the necessary infrastructure to support them. The interplay between land use and mobility systems plays a critical role in connecting people to opportunities and services, as well as to enable efficient flow of goods and resources. Demand for mobility services differ across space and time, due to the type of land use activities, land use mix, development density, accessibility, and myriad other possible factors (Ewing & Cervero, 2001).====Most transportation research is focused on the mode choice, route choice, and implied time valuation of commuters. In comparison, less attention is paid to developing a more comprehensive understanding of land use trip rates (Cervero, 2000; Stanley & Hansen, 2017), and how these trip rates vary as land use mix, demographic profile and accessibility levels differ (Cervero, 1991). For instance, travel surveys offer valuable information on population preferences for mode and distance, and how these preferences vary by commuting purpose. However, it will be challenging to extrapolate from travel surveys the effects of land use on trip rates if there are insufficient observations for analysis (i.e. small sample size), or if type, location, type and magnitude of activity generating locations are unknown (i.e. unobserved by travel survey) or unrepresentative (due to small sample size). This has severely limited progress in modelling trip generation and attraction rates, which are critical estimates required to plan transport infrastructure and services. Even though cell phone-based interactive methods have improved the spatial and temporal granularity of travel surveys in recent years, the cost of obtaining sufficiently large population samples and the latency between survey iterations are still impediments to city planners.====Big datasets like transport fare collection records provide granular population-scale observations of demand for mobility services. The fusion of big travel demand data with land use and administrative data will allow city planners to characterise the land use and mobility patterns of each neighbourhood and distil the differences among them. More importantly, it can serve as a practical and cost-effective way to identify the factors that drive changes in travel demand and understand the purpose of journeys. This will in turn help city planners develop a data informed assessment of infrastructure requirements and provide valuable insights for transport service operators to improve service standards.====In this paper, we describe a novel dataset assembled by the Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in collaboration with leading technology company and ride-hailing operator Grab to study land use-transportation interactions in Singapore. We outline our analytical approach, which takes an activity-based perspective towards modelling land use and mobility interactions to evaluate how bus and rail mobility patterns differ from private hire cars and taxis. We will also show how characteristics of the urban environment such as land use mix, location accessibility, and peak-hour travel demand influence commute by the two modes. The findings from this case study demonstrate the value of a public-private collaboration to study land use mobility patterns, and the feasibility to obtain a set of land use and location sensitive space-time trip rates.====The paper is organised in the following manner. We begin with context setting to describe the urban environment in Singapore and the city planning strategies that have been adopted to improve urban mobility. Against this backdrop, we describe the rise of ride-hailing services and articulate the potential of using this new data source to inform city planning. Thereafter, we describe key attributes of the data and explain the technical details related to data processing and modelling.

This paradigm, which has been prevalent for a hundred or more years, is being challenged by emerging transport service offerings including ride-hailing, ride-sharing, car sharing and bike sharing; and mobility as a service (MaaS). These services, but more particularly the technological platforms underpinning them, have the potential to transform public transportation.====Given this context, this paper qualitatively considers the prospect of competition emerging in (rather than for) segments of the land passenger transport market and supply chain. The paper then explores the policy challenges governments will need to address to ensure they do not hinder competition in a market segment where they currently have a significant role in planning, delivery and regulation.====Recent papers have explored the barriers to MaaS and the new transportation services described in Table 1 focussing on user perceptions and preferences (see for example Ho, Hensher, Mulley, and Wong (2018)) and other barriers such as legislation, regulatory frameworks, market uncertainty and a lack of co-operation between market participants (Konig et al., 2016a; Kamargianni et al., 2015 cited in Karlsson et al. (2020)). However, Karlsson et al. notes that these explorations are predominantly based on expert opinions and/or surveys of stakeholders (2020).====This paper instead looks for potential barriers created by governments or government agencies by looking at issues that have emerged in other industries and sectors that have already been affected by the emergence of competition. As such, the paper is a think piece. It draws from the author's experiences in other network industries which have been liberalised, namely energy and telecoms to identify how governments can inadvertently affect competition. It then identifies areas where government policy and government provided transport services may need to evolve to ensure competition flourishes where efficient. This paper does not attempt to model or analyse in detail the extent to which new transportation services are likely to expand or indeed improve societal outcomes. Instead the focus is on whether there is anything governments can do now to ensure these services can expand and develop, if users feel they offer value, without unduly affecting the other outcomes valued by society.====Section 2 of the paper describes the background and context to the paper, a framework for the analysis and definitions used within the paper. Section 3 includes a high-level qualitative examination of the likelihood of competition emerging for different public transport modes and within segments of the supply chain. This helps identifies areas where new and emerging services may have implications for public transport in the Australian context. Section 4 discusses what reforms may be required to enable efficient competition to emerge in these markets. The paper then looks forward to identify where governments may need to consider liberalisation and regulatory reforms to ensure they do not hinder efficient competition from emerging in these markets.",The coming disruption – The rise of mobility as a service and the implications for government,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300962,1 July 2020,2020,Research Article,251.0

In the context of Inner West Sydney, DRT plays the role of a feeder service during the morning and evening peak periods, where commuters use these services to directly access train stations serving high frequency train services. During the inter-peak and off-peak periods, DRT services provide connection and coverage functions by acting like the traditional bus services, to provide stop-to-stop services. Considering the flexibility in the role of DRT, if successfully integrated with the existing public transport network, it can unlock broader fixed route network enhancements through resource reallocation to the key trunk routes. While the patronage for DRT services was found to steadily increase since the commencement of the operations, the key barrier for these services to attract further regular patronage remains the relatively higher fares arising due to the lack of Opal benefits such as mode transfer discounts or weekly caps. Therefore, while DRT has great potential to link those in less connected areas with public transport hubs, thus facilitating a modal shift away from private vehicles, they need to be affordable and well regulated.","Demand-responsive transit (DRT) is a form of public transit that is characterized by flexible routes and schedules, which generally uses small to medium sized vehicles to provide door-to-door or stop-to-stop/hub services in response to passenger journey requests. Historically, the cost of providing DRT services by either the private or public sector, has been high, in part due to limited patronage in many of the contexts in which it has been introduced, requiring high levels of subsidy. As big a concern as low patronage has been high cost, as additional administrative resources have been required to “dynamically schedule” services according to demand, and to receive and analyse requests which were traditionally delivered by telephone. Also, DRT has often been perceived as institutionally challenging, in part due to the very rigid nature of many tendered or negotiated bus contracts (of a gross cost form), and as a result the supply of DRT services in many jurisdictions has, in the past, been either not allowed or where introduced, discontinued.====The digitally inspired transformation in recent years has offered a new environment, in which customized services that are more user focused have emerged as of growing interest to governments throughout the world. Governments are now actively encouraging the introduction of more flexible user-centric services, of which the provision of DRT services has moved to the mainstream, in contrast to being a niche activity. Private bus operators are being encouraged to consider such flexible services either within their existing mix of contracted services or as additional offerings either under a contract extension or as a market driven economically deregulated initiative as entry barriers are removed.====In general, technological advancements enable DRT operators to deliver improved services for passengers with higher levels of operational efficiency. Furthermore, with the advent of car-based services such as Uber and Uber Pool and increasing costs of fuel and vehicle ownership, some segments of the public have been more receptive to considering alternative modal options to owning a car (at least a second car), with increasing willingness to consider using shared transportation services. As DRT trials in particular increase, and ongoing services are modified with small injections of DRT services, it becomes important to understand the principles of operational success and financial viability which underpin the recent resurgence of DRT services, so as to avoid the concerns from the past.====This paper documents the insights gained from the recently commenced DRT operations by BRIDJ in Inner West area (referred to as Region 6) in Sydney, Australia, which is linked to a recently won contract through competitive tendering that explicitly encouraged DRT in the bid service mix. The Region 6 strategic network plan involves BRIDJ services being introduced as feeder services into trunk transport hubs with more efficient coverage services to fill the coverage gaps. By doing so, it is envisaged that BRIDJ can provide more efficient and customer friendly ‘first and last mile’ and local services, while at the same time facilitating upgrades on the trunk bus network to ‘turn-up-and-go’ style services (i.e., reallocation of large bus resources to trunk corridors with headway frequency).

Such systems provide mobility to passengers and improve local accessibility to various destinations. Therefore, improved accessibility is normally appreciated by potential transit users. However, once they have been constructed, it is almost impossible to change the sites of transit stations or routes. Furthermore, rail transit systems, especially heavy rail system such as subways, require substantial economic investment, usually from public funds (Kim et al., 2018; Song et al., 2012). Thus, it is commonly expected that such huge investments will benefit society in various ways and such benefits manifest in diverse realms, ranging from the environment and economy to public health.====Among the various effects of transit systems, this study focuses on the economic impacts, specifically the capitalization of transit accessibility as assessed through housing prices. It is generally recognized that people appreciate improved transportation accessibility, and a subway system offers reliable mobility and accessibility to those trying to reach nearby areas. In a modern capitalist society, such appreciation is often reflected in the prices of goods where applicable. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that real estate assets near subway networks are more expensive than those distant from them and a rise in real estate assets lead welfare gains (Nothaft, 2004). Many studies have been carried out to empirically investigate the impact of rail transit proximity on housing prices, most of which found that subway accessibility provides positive externalities and economic benefits (Bae et al., 2003; Kim & Zhang, 2005; Mohammad et al., 2013).====Studies of various American metropolitan areas support the positive economic impacts of transit networks on housing prices (Kockelman, 1997; Al-Mosaind et al., 1993; Cervero & Landis, 1993; Henneberry, 1998; Weinberger, 2000; Cervero & Duncan, 2002; Clower & Weinstein, 2002; Hess & Almeida, 2007). Further, Mohammad et al. (2013) noted that urban rail systems in European and East Asian cities appeared to have significantly higher impacts on property values than those in American cities, which was attributed to those populations’ higher dependencies on public transport. On the other hand, a case study examining data on condominiums==== near 19 subway stations in Seoul found that proximity to a subway station did not necessarily mean higher housing prices, and even indicated possible negative impacts on the neighborhood. But such negativity was noted as far as 200 m from the station, and beyond 200 m, a positive association was found at the sites studied (Lee & Kim, 2014).====Many studies have examined the economic impacts of subway systems in South Korea, and most of them were concerned with Seoul's networks (Bae et al., 2003; Choi & Yun, 2004; Lee, 1997; Lee et al., 2010; Lee & Kim, 2014). This is likely because the Greater Seoul area has extensive and actively evolving subway networks with a long history. Most studies on the Seoul metropolitan area have found significant and positive associations between subway networks and housing prices, similar to networks in American metropolitan areas (Choi & Yun, 2004; Kim & Kim, 2019; Kim & Zhang, 2005; Lee et al., 2010). However, relatively small metropolitan areas with subway systems at different levels of maturity have yet to be studied in depth, and, therefore, no consistent or concrete evidence regarding the economic impacts of such systems has been reported.====To address this gap, this study examines the economic impacts of subway networks in smaller metropolitan areas as reflected in housing prices in South Korea. More specifically, actual condominium transaction data for each metropolis is analyzed by employing the traditional hedonic analysis framework and spatial autoregressive process (Efthymiou & Antoniou, 2013; Haider & Miller, 2000). The results of this analysis can elucidate the capitalized effects of subway accessibility in relatively small metropolitan areas and contribute to the empirical evidence base.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Results show DRT is very failure prone; 50% last less than 7 years, 40% last less than 3 years, and about a quarter fail within 2 years. In the UK, 67% of DRTs have failed, and in Australasia, 54%.

In each iteration, inventors, entrepreneurs, and ‘disruptors’ present their new system, often capturing the public imagination and reigniting the debate about whether society should abandon the “horrid” buses and trains of yesteryear and embrace this latest transport revolution. Is it a transport revolution, or is it merely hype driven by investment profiteers?====Going back over 40 years, the concept of Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) is not new by any means. Yet today there is a resurgence for DRT across media platforms. News, blogs, and TED-talks frequently feature an intellectual discussion on the ‘future of transport’, often invoking vocabulary like ====, ====, or other words containing the suffix of ‘-ility’. The expertly marketed start-ups claim that transport can be ‘optimised’ by leveraging mobile technology that has matured over the last decade, allowing travellers to supplement their personal automobile transport with DRT. However, these services are fundamentally an app-based ‘dial-a-ride’ with weak driver contracts and a computerised dispatcher. A major contractual and technical achievement, perhaps; but is it a revolution? or just another version of dial-a-ride which has had very limited success in practice?====Behind the ‘hype’ and media coverage of ‘micro-transit’ is over 30 years of academic research into demand responsive transit (Brake, Mulley & Nelson, 2006, Mageean & Nelson, 2003; Ambrosino, Nelson, & Romanazzo, 2003). This research has explored new ways to operate and design flexible transport services as a means to encourage progressive development of the sector. What this research has not done is spend much time understanding failure of DRT type services. This is understandable, as researchers interested in this sector wish to understand and encourage success. Almost universally researchers in this field are also ‘advocates’ for continued development of DRT and flexible transport services. This has also influenced their lack of interest in DRT failure. This is a pity since failure can be revealing and it is also a major trend in the sector. Even today in the latest ‘micro-transit’ revolution there have been some spectacular failures, such as Bridj which shuttered its U.S. operations in 2017 after averaging a stunning US$1000 (A$1400) subsidy per trip (Marshall, 2017; Schmitt, 2018); and Chariot which recently announced the joyride is over (Marshall, 2019). However, from the founder's perspective they are not seen as failures at all, as both of these schemes were purchased for many millions of dollars by Ford and the Transit Systems Group long before their eventual collapse in U.S. markets.====This paper explores the failure of the group of public transport ‘alternative’ services which are known as Demand Responsive Transit (DRT), dial-a-bus or micro-transit; collectively we call these services DRT. The research explores what we know about failure and success from the research literature. It then explores success and failure factors as experienced in a collated database of DRT schemes from over the last 40 years of research.====The paper is structured as follows; the next section outlines research literature on DRT service types and what we know about DRT failure and success factors. The research methodology is then outlined. Results then describe what we have learned about the length of historical and contemporary DRT schemes as well as what we know about factors influencing their failure and longevity.

Our major findings are as follows. First, in the passenger rail share equation, freight rail share and gasoline price have a positive effect, but passenger rail fare and vertical integration have a negative effect. Second, in the freight rail share equation, passenger rail share and public ownership have a positive effect but diesel price has a negative effect. Third, network condition factors such as rail network density and rail/road network ratio show no clear effect on either passenger or freight rail share equations. Last, in the structural reform/regulation equation, passenger rail share shows a negative effect but freight rail share shows a positive effect. Government debt and unemployment rate show no effect, but liberal government dummy positively affects structural reform/regulation.","By applying the econometric method to railway data from several industrialized countries, this study investigates the inter-effect relationship between major structural reforms and regulation policies in the railway industry and rail mode share as demand for railway services. Among structural reforms and regulations (hereafter referred to as “structural reform/regulation”), especially important topics in current policy discussion include vertical separation, entry regulation, and market liberalization. It is of particular importance to see whether vertical separation and market liberalization are necessary for better performance among railway operators. While there have been many empirical studies of the effect of reform/regulation on cost and productivity—for example, Cantos, Pastor, and Serrano (2010, 2011), Mizutani and Uranishi (2013), and Mizutani, Smith, Nash, and Uranishi (2015)—there have been few studies using real data from the railway industry to explore how structural reform/regulation affects demand. Not only has there been a dearth of quantitative studies using the econometric method, those carried out so far have been weakened by the fact that they are limited to specific countries and regions, with Lalive and Schmutzler (2008) focusing only on Germany, Laabsch and Sanner (2012) on western European countries, Van de Velde et al. (2012) on 26 European counties, Preston and Robins (2013) on the UK, Tomeš (2017) on 27 European countries, and more recently Mizutani (2020) on 30 OECD countries including regions in Europe, North America, East Asia, and Oceania. To address this shortcoming, our study aims to use a wide variety of data, such as cross-country data, to explore the effects of structural reform/regulation on rail mode share as the demand side.====It would seem logical that a change in an industry's demand situation would bring about a shift in structural reform/regulation policy, but other factors can affect policy as well. A desire for uniformity in policy among contiguous nations, as in Europe, might be one motivator for reform, for example. Monetary concerns, such as a national government's budget conditions, or the goal of streamlining and improving business operations can also be catalysts for change, such as happened in the 1980s and 90s, when the privatization of former state railways was widely promoted in industrialized countries (e.g. Mizutani and Nakamura (2019)). In all areas of public policy, it is important to investigate how change is motivated and policy formulated. Indeed, there are several studies that do so (e.g. Mizutani and Uranishi (2010); Hlasny (2011); Haney and Pollitt (2011); Mizutani and Nakamura (2019)), although none of these studies focuses specifically on rail. It is the aim of this paper, therefore, to discover what factors are important to structural reform/regulation policy formation in the rail industry. In the fields of regulatory economics, public economics, and industrial organization, there is an abundance of literature on how regulations are formulated. Here we take from previous literature only the essence and important points relevant to our present aim.====In order to determine the inter-effect of multiple factors, we estimate the structural reform/regulation model and the rail mode share model simultaneously. Data used here are from 29 OECD countries over a period of 19 years from 1995 to 2013. Endogenous variables in this study are structural reform/regulation variables, and rail mode share for both passenger and freight services. Structural reform/regulation variables are (i) overall regulation, (ii) entry regulation, (iii) public ownership, (iv) vertical integration, and (v) market structure. We use 3SLS as the estimation method for this study.====The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. First, empirical studies of the effect on the demand side are few: studies on the market share of rail transportation especially are limited to Van de Velde (2012) and Tomeš (2017). Previous studies provide implications for policy making but it is uncertain whether their findings can hold with countries besides the European countries whose data sets are used. Second, there exist no studies based on simultaneous equation models, the use of which here could be our most important contribution to transportation economics literature. Third, this study provides a theoretical background for formulating rail share equations. We aim to expand upon the pioneering work of Winston (1983), to cover structural reform/regulation and passenger rail share equations. Last, in addition to the structural reform/regulation factor, we consider several others, such as economic factors, network conditions, and so on, based on previous studies. We believe our empirical results can provide useful information for policy making.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Following the introduction, in section 2 we survey previous quantitative studies on the rail demand side and structural reform/regulation and summarize in section 3. In section 4, we present the empirical model, where we explain the factors considered in the models based on previous studies. The essence of the rail share equations is summarized in Appendix-1. We describe three equations: passenger rail share, freight rail share, and structural reform/regulation. We also state the estimation methods and correlation among variables to avoid multicollinearity problems. Section 5 presents data and gives definitions of variables. Data used here are from 29 OECD countries over a period of 19 years from 1995 to 2013. Structural reform/regulation variables are five indices—overall, entry regulation, public ownership, vertical integration, and market structure—all between 0 and 6, reflecting the situation of the structural reform/regulation, with information obtained from the OECD database. We also use binary structural reform/regulation variables based on the original OECD database. The rail share variables are rail mode shares for passenger and freight services. Section 6 presents the results of our empirical analysis, in which we explore what kinds of factors affect structural reform/regulation and what kinds of structural reform/regulation indices affect rail market share. In section 7, we explore the implications of the results, comparing with two similar previous studies of Van de Velde et al. (2012) and Tomeš (2017).

Three types of vertical structure are considered: vertical separation, intermediate organizations, and vertical integration. We focus on the competition factor and managerial factors. A series of our analyses show the following major findings. First, the cost advantageous vertical structure can be explained by the degree of train density. At smaller (larger) train density, vertical separation (integration) is best. At medium train density, an intermediate organization is best. Second, the boundaries distinguishing advantageous vertical structure vary according to several factors. When the effects of misalignment and transaction costs increase, the boundary of ","Among regulatory and structural reforms, vertical separation is an important issue, not only for railway but also for other industries such as electricity, gas, and water supply. In the railway industry, the structural forms selected differ from country to country. For example, vertical separation is typically selected in Europe while vertical integration is common in Japan. Also, there have recently been variations among countries in the types of vertical structure selected, such as vertical separation, a holding company type structure, and vertical integration. With vertical separation, selected in Sweden and the UK, rail service operation is separated from infrastructure management. On the other hand, with vertical integration, selected in Japan, both rail service operation and infrastructure management are carried out within the same company. The holding company type, selected in Germany, separates rail service operation from infrastructure management, but these organizations’ affairs are conducted under the authority of one holding company.====Under these circumstances, it is important to see whether full, legal separation is necessary in order to achieve a level playing field for competition, and whether such separation creates higher costs than with vertical integration. So far, there exist numerous studies, many of which are descriptive studies of the situation in selected countries. Numerous cost studies have also been carried out, but empirical cost studies have produced no conclusive results, with some finding that vertical separation has raised costs or reduced productivity and others finding that vertical separation has reduced costs or increased productivity. Another study contends that vertical separation has no significant effect. A recent study explains the effect of a vertical separation policy on cost, by considering the differences in degree of train density in the empirical cost model, and by applying Williamson's transaction cost concept. Furthermore, Mizutani, Smith, Nash, and Uranishi (2015) analyze the cost effect more specifically by examining the holding company type of vertical separation and the competition factor.====Mizutani and Uranishi (2013) contribute significantly to the literature by finding empirically that the cost advantageous type of vertical structure varies according to train density. By using a simple mathematical cost model, this study explores how the types of vertical structure in the railway industry affect the cost of the rail organization. In this paper, a cost model is set up to express the types of vertical structure (i.e. vertical separation, vertical integration, and intermediate organization). Vertical separation (or integration) is defined according to whether the train service operation is fully separated from (or integrated with) infrastructure management. The intermediate organization is defined as partially separated. This model also expresses the effect of the coordination costs of misalignment of incentive and transaction costs (hereafter referred to simply as ‘misalignment and transaction cost’) due to the separation of organizations. Misalignment and transaction cost is considered by van de Velde et al. (2012), Mizutani and Uranishi (2013) and Nash, Smith, van de Velde, Mizutani, and Uranishi (2014). This cost model includes the positive effect (reducing costs) of vertical separation, which is managerial cost saving due to specializing economies. Moreover, we include the competition effect, although the effect is limited to operation. This mathematical cost model consists of four terms: (i) train operation cost, (ii) infrastructure provision cost, (iii) technological effect due to economies of scope (i.e. technological inter-effect costs between train operation and infrastructure provision), and (iv) managerial cost due to vertical separation.====In this study, we focus mainly on how train density affects cost differences among organizational structures. Our main research questions are as follows. First, where are the break-even boundaries of train density in cost among types of organizational structure? This would be relevant to policy formation in a country or region where higher train density might make vertical integration cost advantageous. Also relevant to policy formation would be the question of what kinds of factors affect the break-even boundary point of train density in the cost. For example, to what degree are variously organized structures affected by the specializing cost saving effect? Third, how do policy-related factors such as the degree of competition and service quality investment affect the break-even boundary point in cost?====The contributions of this study are summarized as theoretical points and policy implications as follows. The foremost and biggest contribution is that our research seems to be among the first to use a mathematical explanation model to determine the superiority of one type of vertical structure over another in terms of costs. Previous empirical research such as Mizutani and Uranishi (2013) and Mizutani et al. (2015) found that vertical separation would reduce costs for lightly used railways, but increase costs for more intensively used railways. However, the base model was insufficiently concrete as a foundation for building an empirical cost model. This study aims to provide background to complement previous empirical research. Second, related to the first contribution, this mathematical explanation model can also explain the differing empirical results presented in previous literature. In other words, cost differences among organizational structures can be explained by the differences in train density. Third, this study shows what types of vertical structure are recommended in terms of costs, and how the desirability changes according to the degree of train density. In the case of lower train density, vertical separation is better than other structures, but with higher train density, vertical integration is better. The intermediate organization falls between these two organizational structures. Our results could therefore help determine guidelines for policy makers seeking to determine the most cost-saving vertical structure under particular circumstances. Fourth, related to the third contribution, this study identifies the factors affecting the boundary at which point one structure becomes preferable to another in terms of cost. Our study finds that the boundary is affected by (i) the specializing cost saving effect, (ii) the effect of misalignment and transaction cost, (iii) the technological effect due to scope economies, (iv) the competition effect, (v) service quality investment, (vi) the degree of vertical separation, and (vii) network length. Fifth, this study shows the effects of key factors important in railway organizations, and the results we have obtained here may to some degree provide useful criteria for policy makers.==== If we give realistic values for these factors, then cost simulation could be possible, the results of which could improve policy decisions. Last, as it is not easy to build a meaningful mathematical model operationally, the model presented here could serve as a foundation for other researchers seeking to build expanded models. As a first step, the operational mathematical model could expand and add meaning to the cost comparison model. Our study could contribute by providing a basic framework for cost comparison models in the future.====The structure of this paper is as follows. After the introduction, section 2 provides a literature review. In this section, we summarize previous studies related to vertical structure. In section 3, the basic structure of the cost comparison model, factors affecting costs and main assumptions, and the analytical model are explained. Section 4 compares the costs among three types of vertical structure: (i) vertical separation type, (ii) intermediate organization type, and (iii) vertical integration type. The results are classified according to train density, which is defined as output per route length. Section 5 summarizes and discusses policy implications.

The use agreement types studied are residual, compensatory and hybrid agreements. We find that airports adopting the residual method are more likely to perform poorly than their counterparts. Compensatory airports are observed to be more efficient. On average, the non-labor operating expense of residual airports was $31 million which is more than double the same expense of compensatory airports. Similarly, the slack in labor input at residual airports was more than two times the excess labor at compensatory airports. On the output side, residual airports had an average shortfall of $5.5 million in non-aeronautical output, compared to $0.14 million at compensatory airports. In the ====, we find that compensatory airports also have a lower probability of having positive input slacks. Compared to residual airports, compensatory airports tend to have a lower probability of a non-aeronautical output slack. Lastly, among the airports that had a positive non-aeronautical output slack, the non-aeronautical output slack of compensatory and hybrid airports was significantly lower than that of residual airports. The findings imply a connection between airport slacks and the vertical agreements between airports and airlines.","The deregulation in 1978 has drastically changed the landscape of the U.S. air transport industry which has since observed an increase number of low-cost carriers and the use of hub-and-spoke systems by major carriers. Increased competition forces airlines to, among other things, be strategic in finding and forming business relationships with airports. Meanwhile, U.S. airports, albeit owned and financed by local governments, are expected or even required to be more financially independent of government funding, so they need a stable stream of users and customers to maintain a solid financial footing in the long termP0F====P especially in light of the growth in U.S. air transportation. Insufficient government funding forces airports to be increasingly self-reliant and to find reliable airline partners to cover their financial deficits.====In the U.S., the vertical airport-airline relationship is formed most commonly through airport use agreements. Airport use agreements in the U.S. can be categorized into three categories in accordance with the rate-setting methods adopted by the airports: residual, compensatory and hybrid. Under a residual agreement, the financial risk of the host airport is covered by signatory airlines. In turn, the signatory airlines pay reduced operational fees at the host airport. Through this agreement, the host airport has better financial security and is able to break even because any budget deficits of the airport will be covered by the signatory airlines. However, since most of the residual agreements have the majority in interest clause, the control span of airport management many restricted. For the signatory airlines, although they may pay reduced user fees, they must bear higher financial risks, specifically the airport's budget deficits.====Under a compensatory use agreement, the airports do not offer preferential rates to any airlines, and the host airports bear their own financial risks. All airlines pay operation fees according to their usage. This type of agreements allows airport management to have more freedom, but since it does not have the financial guarantee of airlines, the management must ensure that airport revenues are enough to cover all airport expenses. The question of who bears the airport financial risk is the key difference between a compensatory agreement and a residual agreement.====In the past two decades, the hybrid agreements, have emerged as a popular agreement type. Hybrid agreements are a blend of compensatory and residual contract features and are therefore more flexible. For example, through this agreement, the signatory airlines may bear the financial risk of only airfield operations while they pay reduced landing fees to the host airport. On the other hand, the host airport may bear the financial risk in terminal operations while it obtains financial protection from the signatory airlines in airfield operations. In addition, the host airport may also share the surplus of non-aeronautical revenues with the signatory airlines.====In this study, using U.S. hub airport data from years 2009–2016, we examine if the use agreement types have a direct effect on airport managerial slacks. The contributions of our study are twofold. First, the study seeks to fill a gap in the existing literature through examining if residual agreements, since they provide financial guarantees or protection to airports, may lead to more airport managerial inefficiency measured by the existence of input and output slacks or avoidable wastes. Second, this analysis attempts to contribute empirically to the current industry practice by determining the areas of managerial slacks associated with the types of vertical contractual arrangements of airports and airlines, and thus to enable practitioners and air transportation officials to address potential shortcomings in operations.====Our study shows that the three agreement types yield different airport efficiency scores. On average, compensatory airports are observed to be more efficient, while residual airports the least efficient. On average, the non-labor operating expense of residual airports was $31 million which is more than double the same expense of compensatory airports. Similarly, the slack in labor input at residual airports was more than two times the excess labor at compensatory airports. On the output side, residual airports had an average shortfall of $5.5 million in non-aeronautical output, compared to $0.14 million at compensatory airports. In the probit regression analysis, we find that compensatory airports also have a lower probability of having positive slacks in non-labor operating expenses, labor, land and runways. In addition, compensatory airports tend to have a lower probability of a non-aeronautical output slack. Lastly, among the airports that had a positive non-aeronautical output slack, the non-aeronautical output slack of compensatory and hybrid airports was significantly lower than that of residual airports.====The input and output slacks of residual airports undermine any gains the signatory airlines may get from the airport use agreements. The arrangements in a residual agreement exert a classic moral hazard problem with asymmetric information and unequal risk sharing. Specifically, because of the financial insulations they provide to the host airport, the signatory airlines face a moral hazard problemP1F====P since they do not have direct observations of the airport's overall operational activities, and the airport might increase its risk exposure or reduce its efforts because it is financially protected by the signatory airlines.====To our knowledge, none of the existing literature has examined the sources of inefficiency associated with the agreements, and no study has thus far attempted to identify the areas of operations that can be improved. Faulhaber, Schulthess, Eastmond, Lewis, and Block (2010) suggested that because of the financial guarantee provided by the signatory airlines, the host airports may be less motivated to perform their jobs as efficiently, but no study has attempted to measure the extent of the potential managerial slacks. Vasigh and Hamzaee (1998) studied the effects of the agreements on airport's profitability, they did not examine the effects on airport operations. Karanki and Lim (2020) noticed that residual agreements led to lower airport operational efficiency, but their model ignored the existence of input and output slacks; thus they were unable to identify the sources of the inefficiency associated with the agreement type, and they also did not identify the input excesses and output shortfalls that airport management should target according to the use agreement. Our study overcomes the shortcomings of previous studies by identifying the type and size of airport managerial slacks in inputs and outputs and by examining the relationship between the slacks and the airport use agreement type. This information allows the airports to improve their operational strategies and managerial practices. Furthermore, the findings are also important for the airlines who have to weather their own economic and operational challenges, and meanwhile they must strike a delicate balance between reducing costs and securing access to airport facilities to maintain or expand operations.====In the following section, we give a brief review of previous airport efficiency studies and the airport use agreements. In sections 3 Slacks-based measure of efficiency, 4 Data, we discuss the slacks-based measure of efficiency and the data, respectively. In section 5, we present the results and analysis.

From a situation where most public transport services were provided by publicly owned companies, it has moved to a situation where most are private. Long distance bus services, most local bus services outside London and a small number of rail services are left to commercial operators to provide without regulation on a purely commercial basis. Most rail services, bus services in London and subsidised bus services elsewhere are competitively tendered by central or local government. In the bus ====, both forms of competition have substantially reduced costs, but competitive tendering of services planned by local authorities has been the more successful in boosting patronage. On the other hand, on the rail system, whilst competitive tendering has again gone hand in hand with a large rise in usage, it has also been accompanied by a large rise in costs. Some possible reasons for this difference are considered, but it does appear that caution should be exercised when transferring lessons from one mode to the other.","Public transport has often been viewed as a natural monopoly, subject to economies of scale and with strong public interest arguments for public intervention, because transport is seen as a social necessity for everyone, and because by attracting passengers from using the private car it reduced externalities of congestion and pollution. Thus, it has often been provided by a public sector monopoly. Where competition has been introduced, building on the work of Demsetz (1968), it is frequently considered that competition for the market (or ex ante competition) is a more appropriate means of introducing competition in public transport than competition in the market (or “on-road/on-track” competition). Under this model, the government can specify what it wants to provide and then invite the market to bid for the exclusive right to provide these services on a given route or routes. In this way, it is thought that efficient production can be ensured, whilst leaving the public sector to specify service levels and fares.====Competitive tendering has been introduced for public transport in many countries, with the result generally of significant cost savings (Hensher & Wallis, 2005), although variable with circumstances (such as whether the incumbent was publicly or privately owned). What has been observed, however, is that usually competitive tendering after the initial round does not produce more cost savings, and indeed often some of those from the first round are lost. Competitive tendering has been less used for rail than for bus but a number of countries have done so and again the result has generally been to reduce costs (Nash, Smith, Crozet, Link, & Nilsson, 2019).====By contrast, competition in the market is relatively scarce, partly because public transport is generally subsidised so profitable opportunities are rare. Where it does exist, it is generally for long distance bus, and in a few cases rail services. It appears that competition in the market typically leads to improved services and lower fares in these long distance markets.====Britain is a particularly interesting case study in that both forms of competition exist in both bus (including local bus) and rail services. Britain is the country in Europe which has gone furthest in moving away from the public sector monopoly model of public transport procurement, having completely deregulated and largely privatised the provision of bus services under the 1985 Transport Act, and completely privatised rail passenger services under the Railways Act of 1993 (rail infrastructure was also privatised but reverted to public ownership following the failure of Railtrack). Moreover, Britain has made use of a combination of competition for the market (by means of competitive tendering) and competition in the market (with competing companies offering services on the same route). Bus services outside London were deregulated on the basis of competition in the market, except where subsidy was needed. Bus services in London and rail services were privatised largely on the basis of competition for the market, with local or central government respectively still tightly specifying the services to be provided. Thus, British experience should be a good test of which form of competition works best.====We consider in turn the experiences of the bus and rail sectors before seeking to reach conclusions.",Public transport procurement in Britain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300366,29 April 2020,2020,Research Article,260.0

The introduction of an AV-based transit system shall create multi-faceted effects on reshaping travel behaviour (Davidson & Spinoulas, 2015). However, issues with respect to system feasibility have not yet been well verified at a system level.====In Singapore, as a form of public transport (PT), Dynamic Autonomous Rapid Transit (DART) is proposed by TUMCREATE==== by applying the concept of connected AVs (CAVs) mobility system. DART is expected make a significant step towards achieving the Land Transport Authority (LTA) 2040 vision of a transport network that is convenient, well-connected and fast. As a consequence, PT passengers would take no more than 20 min to get from home to the nearest neighbourhood centre, and 45 min or less, in most cases, to reach their workplace during peak hours. The DART system consists of a fleet of mixed-size modular electric, AVs to realise an efficient, attractive and comfortable mobility service. The high efficiency performance of the AV-based DART system is achieved by comprehensively improving its operating condition: first, better integration with intelligent bus stop ensures a quicker boarding/alighting process which contributes to a shorter dwelling time; second, the dynamic prioritisation on road enables smoother travel with minimal negative impacts on private cars; third, the demand-responsive dispatching function strengthens its adaptability to fluctuating demand with dynamic capacities (low, medium and high); and last, the platoon feature makes sure that simultaneous DART vehicles on road are combined to form platoon(s) that minimises traffic impacts on the roads. Therein, for high capacity service, DART vehicles are platooned to create a line capacity up to 6000 passengers per hour; for medium capacity service, the operation is similar to the existing bus system with a line capacity of up to 1200 passengers per hour; for low capacity, a single DART vehicle serves an on-demand service with up to 30 passengers. Details of the aforementioned features of DART system can be found in Rau, Tiana, Jaina, Xiea, and Zhou (2018). A study area for DART development in Singapore is as shown in Fig. 1.====This study aims to provide an economic assessment of DART, from both operator's and users' points of view. From the operator's perspective, system efficiency is investigated and compared with existing bus system.

Moreover, the heterogeneous effects of HSR were explored in terms of the location conditions of the city and ","A notable feature of China's urbanization is the rapid expansion of urban space. Unlike the land expropriation system in Western countries, urban land in China usually expands by converting rural collective land into urban construction land at a low land expropriation price (Chen, 2009). In the process of urbanization, rural-to-urban migration and industrial development have triggered a demand shock to urban space. However, the rapid urban expansion has also caused a series of problems such as cultivated land abandonment (Shi et al., 2016), land lost of farmers (Liu & Lu, 2005), and environmental pollution (Fan, Chen, & John, 2016). Therefore, urban space expansion is not always beneficial to urban development. In the context of China's rapid urbanization, it is critical to identify the determinants of urban space expansion.====Transport infrastructure plays an important role in urban space change (Andong & Sajor, 2017; Baum-Snow, 2007; Song, Ye, Zhu, & Deng, 2016). As an importation part of the modern transportation system in China, high-speed railway (HSR) has deeply affected urban spatial structure and land use. First, the construction of HSR network can enhance economic links among cities (Wang, Jiao, & Jin, 2014). On the one hand, the access to HSR services improves the accessibility of cities and creates the spatial-temporal convergence effects (Gutiérrez, 2001; Zhang, Nian, & Lyu, 2016). On the other hand, the distributional effects of HSR network lead to some marginalised cities (Jiao, Wang, Jin, & Dunford, 2014; Monzón, Ortega, & López, 2013; Ortega, López, & Monzón, 2014). Second, HSR largely reduces the travel costs of people and promotes the agglomeration of population and industries (Banister & Berechman, 2001; Froeidh, 2005; Guirao, Campa, & Casado-Sanz, 2018; Kasraian, Maat, Stead, & Van Wee, 2016). Finally, HSR can also increase the market potential and the land value in cities (David, Zheng, & Corinne, 2012).====The development benefits from HSR have spread throughout the regions along the railway and become a powerful impetus for local economic development and urban land expansion (Jia, Zhou, & Qin, 2017). Therefore, more and more cities are taking advantage of HSR as an opportunity to promote economic growth and urban expansion. In China, many cities along HSR routes have vigorously promoted the construction of HSR-led new towns. However, many of these towns have failed to achieve the desired objectives and aggravated the conflicts between cultivated land protection and urban land expansion (Song et al., 2016; Yue, Zhang, & Liu, 2016).====Currently, China's “four north-south and four east-west corridors” plan for HSR network has been basically completed. The next HSR project, “eight north-south and eight east-west corridors”, will cover more cities in China. With the development of HSR network, the scope and capacity of HSR service have been largely improved. Because of the close relation between HSR development and urbanization in China, it is of great practical significance to examine the causal effect of HSR on urban space evolution. This paper mainly conducts the following three bodies of works: first, by using a dataset of 247 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2015, this paper attempts to identify the causal effect of HSR on urban space expansion; second, the data on daily frequency of HSR trains was manually collected to examine the effect of HSR services quality on urban expansion; and third, the heterogeneous effects of HSR operation on urban expansion were investigated according to urban characteristics.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

There are around 179,000 jeepneys of which 90% are fifteen years or older. However, this is not without so many other issues on the road. To address this, the government issued a landmark policy enabling the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP), a transformational large-scale initiative focused on land-based public transport in which the majority are jeepneys. The program brings about a comprehensive reform covering new policies in the franchising process, vehicle modernization, operator consolidation and changes in the current business model, financing and a more structured route planning process, among others. This is an ambitious undertaking, not merely because of its scale, but the likely disruption to the current, relatively informal model by which jeepneys are regulated. This paper uses deductive thematic analysis, based upon a review of the literature on informal/formal hybridised urban transport regulatory models, to investigate the reform's likely impact on the dynamics of the sector. As such it tentatively confirms the likely issues arising when transitioning from an informal model to a more formalised one. The paper raises ==== for the global informal transport sector as a whole.","The nature of public passenger transport in many Philippine cities can be described as the informal complementing the formal. With minimal barriers to entry, public transport services act as a point of access for the urban labour force and provide mobility for much of the city's workforce (Mateo-Babiano, 2016).====Jeepneys constitute the most dominant public transport modes in the Philippines. These are 12 to 16-seater paratransit vehicles that were repurposed from American military jeeps left over from the Second World War. Due to their predominance they have acquired significant cultural, social and familial significance (Meñez, 1998). At present there are around 179,000 jeepneys across the country. Ninety percent of these are at least fifteen years old and produce significant environmental pollution (DOTr 2018; Fabian & Gota, 2009; Regidor, Vergel, & Napalang, 2009). A survey of jeepney passengers found that while they consider this form of transport to be familiar, easy and cheap, they are also regarded as noisy, dirty and dangerous (Okamura, Kaneko, Nakamura, & Wang, 2013) and that commuters habitually used this mode even for distances that could be completed by walking and cycling (Guillen, Ishida, & Okamoto, 2013).====Environmental, safety, and efficiency concerns around the sector have led to the establishment of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program or PUVMP (DOTr, 2018), a transformative program that seeks to modify the entire sector and modernise the vehicle fleet. It seeks to revamp the practices, policies, business models, and cultural meanings of the existing public transport system in the Philippines (Sunio, Gaspay, Guillen, Mariano, & Mora, 2019). The program has ten components: regulatory reform; local public transport route planning for local government Units; route rationalisation; fleet modernization; industry consolidation; financing; vehicle useful life program; pilot implementation; stakeholder support mechanisms; and, communication. Its implementation involves more than twenty local and international partner agencies.====As with other cities, such as in Cape Town, many operators have opposed these initiatives (Schalekamp, 2017). Several transport groups have been staging strikes against the proposed new regulatory model (Rey, 2018), while some groups regard the initiatives as profit-oriented and ‘anti-poor’ (Talabong, 2017), something which may result in small individual owned businesses losing autonomy and leading to bankruptcy as in Mozambique's informal employment sector (Dibben, Wood, & Williams, 2015). Whilst there are several global studies that examine the potential disruption to the informal transport sector through formalisation (Behrens, McCormick, Orero, & Ommeh, 2017; Cervero & Golub, 2007; Mokonyama & Venter, 2013) none has yet taken place within the context of reform of the jeepney sector in the Philippines. It would not be unreasonable, however, to assume that there would be some commonality to the problems encountered for each.====This paper undertakes deductive thematic analysis to confirm that the problems cited in the literature from other cities are likely to recur in the consolidation and reform of the jeepney reform in the Philippines. It deduces several key themes stemming from the examination of transport literature surrounding informal/formal hybridised transport regulatory models. It then confirms the presence of these themes within the context of jeepney recapitalisation and sector reform in Metro Manila, by coding a consolidated set of interviewee transcribes from informed stakeholders. In eliciting these themes, the authors seek to develop a constructive research agenda for jeepney sector capitalisation and consolidation in the Philippines, which may be applied in other countries. This will inform the debate, explore implications for policy as well as social equity, and assist the sector in managing the hybridisation of informal and formal urban transport solutions. The paper will not seek to offer a normative stance regarding informal transport, as shown in work of Schwanen (2018), Mutongi (2006), Kumar, Singh, Ghate, Pal, and Wilson (2016) and Rizzo (2015).

The rapid growth of urban freight transportation due to changes in the supply chain (e.g. just-in-time, e-shopping, home deliveries and instant deliveries) has resulted in ever-increasing numbers of deliveries and light goods vehicles in residential areas, generating major impacts on city liveability and sustainability (Baur, Thess, Kleinschmit, & Creutzig, 2014; Browne, Allen, Nemoto, Patier, & Visser, 2012; Dablanc et al., 2011; de Carvalho, Cabral Ribeiro, García-Martos, González Fernández, & Vidal Vieira, 2019; Ducret, 2014; Visser, Nemoto, & Browne, 2014; White Paper, 2001), in three major respects, namely environment, economy and society (ONU, 2015):====Therefore, the new challenge facing urban planners is to find solutions/measures that can reduce the impacts of urban goods mobility without penalising the life of the city (sustainable city logistics solutions/measures). In fact, such measures are sometimes conflicting, and generate impacts that depend on the acceptance of stakeholders as well as external factors (Marcucci, Gatta, Scaccia, 2015; Sánchez-Díaz, Georén, Brolinson, 2017; Rotaris, Danielis, Sarman, & Marcucci, 2012; Lindholm, 2013; Stathopoulos, Valeri, & Marcucci, 2012; Gatta, Marcucci, Pira, Scaccia, & Site, 2018; Gatta, Marcucci, Delle Site, Le Pira, & Carroccia, 2019). For example, the task of local government (e.g. public authorities and planners) is to seek to reduce transport impacts in order to ensure cities more attractive for end consumers (e.g. residents and visitors) alike (mainly ==== and ==== sustainability, entailing a reduction in congestion, pollutants and accidents), while retailers (or producers) and private companies (e.g. carriers and couriers) seek to deliver and pick up goods at the lowest cost, performing high-quality transport operations and achieving short lead-times in order to fulfil user expectations (mainly ==== sustainability).====With a view to tackling the above problems in the context of city planning, the European Commission promotes the concept of sustainable urban mobility, supporting guidelines for developing Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP, 2019). According to the SUMP approach, the guidelines for developing and implementing Sustainable Urban Logistics Plans (SULPs) were defined within the research project called ENCLOSE (Energy Efficiency in city logistics services for small and mid-sized European historic towns; Ambrosino, Liberato, & Pettinelli, 2015; Marcucci, Gatta, Marciani, & Cossu, 2017). Therefore, according to the new challenges of urban planning, i.e. to identify solutions for improving city environment and hence to have tools for assessing city logistics scenario before implementation and the obtainable results to be verified afterwards, demand models play a key-role in support decision making. In fact, within the assessment methodology, they interact with supply models in order to produce the network link flows and allow traffic impacts to be estimated. Subsequently, guided by the desirability to have demand models able to point out the relationships among the different actors of urban transport and logistics, literature is reviewed pointing out the opportunity to use an integrated (restocking and shopping) urban freight modelling framework.====Then, this study seeks to answer the following questions, considering that an “optimum modelling framework” cannot be defined in absolute terms:====The paper is organised as follows.

We estimate a multinomial, a mixed and two hybrid mixed logit models, with the interaction between EC knowledge, car attributes and additional exogenous covariates. We use three measurement equations to estimate the self-assessed car knowledge, assessed EC knowledge and EC driving experience. We report three main findings. First, the inclusion of EC knowledge improves our capability to explain car choice. Second, the degree of EC knowledge does not change the negative perception respondents have, ====, on ECs. Third, the level of EC knowledge influences the importance placed on the attributes of the choice model. Specifically, a higher level of EC knowledge is associated with a lower concern with fast charging station density. Our results are useful for car manufacturers who wish to improve their marketing strategies through tailored ==== efforts, and for policy makers who wish to implement educational campaigns as a means to foster EC uptake.","The choice of an EC stems from a cognitive and emotional relationship between the potential buyer and the car. Such a relationship emerges from the interaction amongst a series of factors, including the marketing policies of car manufacturers, clients' interest and cognitive effort, and the informational campaigns on sustainable mobility enacted by the policy makers at both the national and local level. Car manufacturers actively promote their cars and inform customers through advertising campaigns, dealers, or specific programs aimed at educating consumers on the technical and functional characteristics of their endothermic vehicles. Beyond their informational value, these campaigns build consumers’ loyalty and differentiate products by highlighting their innovative content.====In the transportation economics literature, hybrid choice models (HCMs) help explore the role of attitudes and perceptions in transport decisions. A pioneering contribution is provided by Daziano and Bolduc (2013), who study how Canadian consumers' choice among four alternative powertrain technologies is affected by a latent variable aimed at capturing environmental awareness. Their empirical results confirm that environmental-conscious consumers are willing to pay more for low-emission vehicles. A similar outcome is found by Jensen, Cherchi, and Mabit (2013), who analyze how the individual attitudes towards the environment shape the choice between an electric and a conventional car, before and after a three-month real driving experience with an electric vehicle (EV). The importance of latent variables is confirmed by Kim, Rasouli, and Timmermans (2014), who study consumers' intention to buy an EC accounting for the role of five latent variables: environmental beliefs toward ECs, economic aspects, battery aspects, perception on the ECs' technological stage of development, and innovation value. Some years later, Kim, Rasouli, and Timmermans (2016) study the impact on car buying intentions of environmental, battery and innovation-related perceptions. Glerum, Stankovikj, Thémans, and Bierlaire (2014) analyze how a pro-leasing and a pro-convenience attitude influence individual preferences. Valeri and Cherchi (2016) investigate the role of habits, measured by the frequency of car trips per week, car as a main transport mode, and a self-assessed car knowledge. Cherchi (2017) focuses on the impact of both informational and normative conformity in users’ choices. Soto, Cantillo, and Arellana (2018a) analyze how environmental concern, pro-technology attitudes and pro-car use attitudes influence car choice. Krause, Carley, Lane, and Graham (2013) analyze the effect of misunderstandings or misperceptions about selected EC characteristics, using however an OLS model instead of an HCM.====Taking advantage of an exploratory stated choice survey carried out in 2017 in an Italian region, the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, this paper adds to the literature by specifically focusing on the role of EC knowledge in determining car choice. Our assumption is that, since ECs are a new product, subject to high uncertainty, the level of knowledge of ECs might play an important role. In fact, ECs are subject to technological (e.g., car performance in different traffic conditions, battery degradation, battery charging, range limitations), economic (e.g., residual value, energy efficiency) and political (e.g., EC and infrastructure incentives and regulation connected with their environmental properties) uncertainty, which could, to some extent, be reduced by proper information. The latent variable EC knowledge is measured in this paper through three indicators, i.e. self-assessed car knowledge, “objective” (assessed) EC knowledge, and EC driving experience. At the time of the survey, in Italy the general level of EC knowledge was probably low, since Italy was still in the early days of EC uptake. In the following years, various government policies (purchase subsidies, free parking and unconstrained access to limited traffic zones) enhanced the level of EC penetration and several traditional and social media discussed with more detail and precision the ECs’ pros and cons.====The findings of the paper, although based on an admittedly limited sample (N = 200), could be useful at least for three reasons. First, they shed light on the relationship between EC knowledge and purchase choice. Second, they help car manufacturers in defining their marketing strategies eventually enhancing their informational content. Third, they provide suggestions to policy makers to use educational campaigns as a tool to foster EC uptake.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the stated choice experiment and the data collection process, providing descriptive statistics of the sample. Section 3 illustrates the modelling framework and Section 4 discusses the results.

We use a discrete choice experiment to determine the optimal modal choice under the current set of available alternatives (train, bus, flights, car-pooling, private car) and the planned HSR services on the Bari-Rome and Brindisi-Rome route. The comparative analysis of the two routes allows us to investigate the effect of distance/time on the modal choice, in a similar geographical context characterized by the same set of modal alternatives. Using original data gathered through a stated/revealed preference exercise we find that the probability of changing the modal choice toward HSR increases with age, income and education as well as the purpose of the trip (Business), but the latter only for long-distance connections (above 500 km). Finally, we find that the potential shift in demand is more likely to come from air transport (air-to-HSR) and conventional rail services (rail-to-HSR).","In recent years air transport operators have been facing a major threat, at least for short-haul distances. The introduction and expansion of high-speed rail (HSR) on short- and medium-haul routes have intensified competition in the transport market leading to changes in the air operators' business strategies (see e.g. Albalate et al., 2015, Bergantino, 2015, Bergantino and Capozza, 2015a, Bergantino & Capozza, 2015b, Bergantino et al., 2015, Bergantino, Capozza, & Capurso, 2019, Jiménez and Betancor, 2012, ====). In Italy, as an example, after the introduction of HSR on the Milan-Rome line in 2012, Ryanair, a leading low-cost carrier, decided to abandon the route. On the same line, train modes, including HSR and traditional trains, experienced a substantial growth, from approximately 36% of the market shares in 2008 to 65% in 2014, when adjusting for demand expansion. By contrast, air transport market shares reduced to 24% in 2014 from 50% of 2008. Similar effects were also found on the Chinese market on very highly populated corridors with low cost carriers facing a lower survival rate when HSR are introduced (Wang, Xia, & Zhang, 2017). Therefore, although HSR determine an overall increase in demand, there has been also a reallocation and a change in airlines’ strategies especially of those companies specializing in point-to-point services.====At the more aggregate level, however, the competitive pressure worldwide and the reduction in short-haul air travel did not result in the overall reduction in total air travel demand, which increased thanks to operators reorganizing their routes (Clewlow, Sussman, & Balakrishnan, 2014) and to forms of air-HSR integration.====This paper focuses on short-haul routes where intermodal substitution is more pronounced due to the fierce competitive pressure. On short- and medium-haul distances, in fact, changes in operators’ business strategies when facing the introduction of HSR operators have twofold dimensions: the supply-side one and the demand-side one. Most recent empirical papers addressed the former. For instance, earlier contributions have shown that airlines reacted to the introduction of HSR with changes in the number of flights (Jiménez & Betancor, 2012; Dobruszkes, Dehon, & Givoni, 2014; Chen, 2017), seats (Dobruszkes et al., 2014; Albalate et al., 2015; Wan, Ha, Yoshida, & Zhang, 2016; Chen, 2017). Yet, the “demand dimension” is also relevant. When HSR is introduced, transport demand becomes more elastic as passengers have more option to exploit (Zhang, Yang, & Wang, 2013; 2017). Previous articles have shown that the introduction of HSR services can lead to a significant change in demand (De Rus & Nash, 2007; Clewlow et al., 2014; Chen, 2017). Partly, this is dependent on the greater attractiveness of HSR on shorter and medium distances over flights, due, mainly, to the reduced impact of access and egress time (see e.g., discussion in Wang, Xia, Zhang, & Zhang, 2018; and, more specifically on the theme of access and egress time, Bergantino, Button, & Madio, 2019). Partly, this also depends on users' preferences heterogeneity for the different characteristics of the services (e.g., frequency of services, reliability, tariffs, etc.) as well as the possibility to use access to the Internet when travelling.====However, most of the related and existing studies (e.g., Hensher, 1997; Ortúzar & Simonetti, 2008; Park & Ha, 2006), as discussed below, do not include an ample combination of alternatives, e.g. not only traditional rail services already existing, but also air, bus, private car and car-sharing services (such as ====) when considering the impact of HSR. Likewise, these studies do not provide a complete picture of passenger preferences and of how individual characteristics may condition the choice to select HSR when introduced, other things equal.====This paper tackles this issue and investigates the determinants of intermodal substitution between different transport modes and HSR, when the latter is introduced. Using a unique dataset based on a Stated Preferences experiment carried out in Southern Italy in two locations (Bari and Brindisi), we study how individuals facing a ==== based on ==== alternatives change their decision when HSR becomes available, given the same characteristics of the alternative options. As each individual was required to make a decision on his/her optimal modal choice without and with HSR multiple times and we have information about socio-economic conditions and travel habit for each respondent, we are able to provide an exhaustive picture of intermodal substitution. In practice, given the optimal modal choice without and with HSR in a given choice set, we provide new insights on the type of passengers that are more likely to switch to the new alternative and what are the individual-specific conditions that influence such a decision. Similarly, we provide evidence for patterns of intermodal substitution and the origin of the modal shift.====The analysis is conducted using a Stated Preference approach for the analysis of a route in Southern Italy, where HSR is planned to be operating from 2026 but still not available and where the land accessibility conditions are limited as compared to other Italian regions but are similar between the two cities considered: Bari and Brindisi. Furthermore, although the socio-economic and institutional conditions are similar in the two cities they are in differing position with respect to the optimal distance for rail and road transport compared to air transport. Bari falling in the slot of 0–500 km and Brindisi being in the slot greater than 500 km.====As it is well know, the approach we used is particularly suitable to estimate demand when one of the alternatives considered does not exist. On the chosen route, HSR is expected to represent a competitive force to the current airline operators (i.e., Ryanair and Alitalia), as already demonstrated on other routes (e.g., the Milan-Rome one). Besides, the area has also the advantage of having two consecutive Origins/Destinations which are both well served with a number of different modal alternatives (road, rail, and air), being on the same railway line and having both well-connected airports.====The data gathering was carried out on the Bari-Rome and Brindisi-Rome routes, which will be described in the following section. This implies asking individuals to make the optimal choice both in presence and absence of the new line given some characteristics of a broad range of modal alternatives: conventional rail services; airline services, bus services, private car and carpooling. The latter is one of the novelties of this study: until now, no other study has included among the alternatives car-pooling services, such as ====Moreover, we are also interested in assessing the effect in terms of intermodal substitution when the travel distance increases by more than 100 km (as in the case of Rome-Brindisi w.r.t. Rome-Bari). Typically, the estimated threshold for which HSR becomes more attractive is around 500 km (e.g., Gleave, 2004; Rothengatter, 2010; Vickerman, 1997) but more recent estimates have shown large attractiveness even up to 1.000 km (see e.g., Zhang, Graham, & Wong, 2018 relative to the Japanese market). Our analysis allows us to verify how the likelihood to switch to HSR changes when the distance between the origin and the destination increases. As Bari and Brindisi are characterized by the presence of the same modal alternatives and similar socio-economic conditions, we can compare quite easily the results, assuming homogeneous population. Understanding the determinants for modal change is rather relevant since the planned line is likely to work also as an generator of demand from the surrounding area, attracting additional travellers and, thus, sustaining the demand for the new services.====Indeed, we provide one of the first evidence from Southern Italy, an area which has traditionally compensated its network infrastructural gap by sustaining the development of its airports (Bari and Brindisi) to be connected with other cities in Italy and Europe. Moreover, Bari and Brindisi belong to a region which still remains one of the poorest regions in Italy, with approximately 20% of people living in a condition of relative poverty.==== This implies that the effects of the introduction of HSR will necessarily depend on the prices chosen by the train operator alongside the characteristics of the alternative modes.====Using original data gathered through a stated/revealed preference exercise, we find that the likelihood of changing the modal choice when HSR is introduced increases with the age, income level, and education as well as with the purpose of the trip (Business). In other words, we provide evidence for the larger attractiveness of these services for those population segments more likely to be less price elastic and more sensitive to time. These results are in line with those found in an ex-post evaluation for the Paris-London HSR line, showing large heterogeneity with respect to the purpose of travel (Behrens & Pels, 2012). Additionally, we find that the potential shift in demand is more likely to come from air transport (air-to-HSR) and conventional rail services (rail-to-HSR) as compared to modal alternatives which may exhibit a large intrinsic evaluation for the driver (i.e., car) or typically associated with last-minute booking or low fares (e.g., bus or car-pooling). Indeed, our results confirm the competitive pressure imposed on airlines from the (potential) entry of HSR operators on short- and medium-haul as well as the risks of market cannibalization in the existing rail market. Interestingly, the latter case assumes more relevance when the service provider of HSR is also one of the service providers in the conventional rail segment (e.g., the Italian incumbent Trenitalia). Direct competition in the market between conventional and HSR services, as previously found by Behrens and Pels (2012), may be detrimental for the provider's profits.====This article contributes to the literature on competition and substitution between HSR and air transport. Most of this literature investigated the ex-post effects on the market structure. By using aggregate data on traffic and prices, these papers verify that where HSR services are absent and competition between airlines and (traditional) rail companies is limited the effect is reversed and airlines use their market power to increase fares (see e.g., Bergantino & Capozza, 2015a,b; Bergantino et al., 2015 for the Italian case, and Zhang, Yang, & Wang, 2017 for the Chinese one). Yet, this literature neglects the individual determinants of the decision to travel by HSR when this is introduced, therefore the socio-economic characteristics of the travellers more likely to move from the air transport to HSR. The lack of systematic survey data on passenger behaviours on certain routes makes different to properly estimate the demand for different services and how this would change under different scenarios.====The closest studies to ours are those using Stated Preferences data to estimate demands and the willingness-to-pay. In this sense, our paper is very close to Hensher (1997) and Ortúzar and Simonetti (2008). In a seminal contribution, Hensher (1997) study the demand for a potential HSR line on the route between Sydney and Canberra including socio-demographic controls. The author calculated direct and cross fare elasticities for different market segments, that is, the car-non business market and the air-business segment and show a large substitution between HSR first class and air transport economy. Ortúzar and Simonetti (2008) use a mixed data estimation (using both Stated Preference and Revealed Preference data) to estimate the potential impact of HSR on the route Santiago-Concepcion in Chile. When estimating demand, the authors include some socio-economic variable to control for the predicted demand. However, they fail to explain the socio-economic determinants of the modal switch and the potential original of HSR demand in a richer environment. Other studies which are similar to ours do not consider the large number of alternatives we have. For instance, Park and Ha (2006), alike ours, provide an appraisal of modal substitution between HSR (Korea Train Express) and air transport in Korea using a Stated Preference approach. They find that KTK would reduce the air transport demand by approximately 85%. Unlike the authors, we consider a very broad set of transport alternatives and we are able to map potential switching behaviours from different locations (Bari and Brindisi) and different modal choices.====More recently, Bergantino, Button et al. (2019) analyze the impact of access, egress and in-vehicle travel time on the optimal modal choice for getting between two destinations in the presence and in absence of HSR. They verify that the potential introduction of HSR leads travelers to evaluate more access and egress time than the in-vehicle time, as a consequence of the increased disutility derived from the fragmentation of the journey. They also find that the intermodal competition between airlines and rail operators is still intense even when the average travel distance increases from 450 km to about 600 km, which is generally defined as the limit distance for intermodal substitution between air and other travel modes. These results are in line with recent evidence from the Northeast Asian market (Wan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). However, we assess the decision to change the optimal modal choice when the consideration set changes from five modal alternatives to six, with the latter case including HSR. This allows us to understand which are the modal alternatives that are more likely to generate a switch toward HSR for a given combination of fares, frequency, and travel time.====Understanding modal changes is relevant for at least three reasons. First, it contributes, in terms of recommendations for policy-makers, policies’ design, project appraisal and its distributive effects. Given limited budgetary resources, policy-makers need to reduce the risk of wasting resources on projects which would not attract sufficient demand. Second, it supports the understanding of the patterns of intermodal substitution and the origin of the potential demand for a new and faster alternative, providing information about the direction of competition and insights for incumbent operators and services. Third, it would yield insights for competing operators, which could suffer from the establishment of HSR services. In this sense, it may help air operators to price discriminate users by targeting offers and to provide incentives to adopt more aggressive yield management strategies (e.g., younger travellers more flexible but more price sensitive; business vs. leisure travellers; high vs. low income, etc.). Similarly, it may help operators to reorganize their traffic by prioritizing more profitable and long-haul routes.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview of the local context of the experiment. In section 3 we present the design of the choice game. In section 4 we provide some descriptive statistics, whereas section 5 presents the econometric strategies. Section 6 contains the main results and in section 7 we provide concluding remarks.",Intermodal competition and substitution.

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the innovations. Connected and electric vehicle technologies are considered to be the development directions of AVs. This paper aims to understand ==== towards autonomous, connected, and electric vehicles (ACEVs), using data collected through a survey in China. The results indicate that respondents found the potential for environmental-friendly transport, increased accessibility of travel for non-drivers, and reduced driving fatigue as the most attractive aspects of ACEVs. Conversely, respondents were most concerned about vehicle safety, legal liability, and charging issues. It is implicated that battery service life, driving mileage, and charging are prominent barriers to the adoption of ACEVs. The perceived benefits and related infrastructure improvements show positive effects on respondents’ willingness to adopt ACEVs, while concerns and cost reduce their appeal.","Emerging vehicular technologies play a vital role in the transformation of transportation systems. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to have profound impacts on the future transportation systems and, as a result, have attracted widespread attention. AVs exhibit potential environmental and economic benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, relieving traffic congestion, reducing parking space, and improving road safety (Anderson et al., 2014; Greenblatt & Saxena, 2015). In addition, AVs display potential mobility benefits, such as the reduction of travel costs, improved accessibility, and an increase in mobility options for non-drivers (Anderson et al., 2014; Litman, 2017; Meyer, Becker, Bösch, & Axhausen, 2017). It is projected that a small share of level 4–5 AVs will be commercially available in 2020, with the overall market share increasing to approximately 40% of vehicle travel in 2040 (Litman, 2017). Connected vehicles (CVs), an indispensable component of AVs, can support the utilization of intelligent routing systems; these systems has the potential to reduce crashes, alleviate congestion, and improve travel efficiency (Bagloee, Tavana, Asadi, & Oliver, 2016). The U.S. Department of Transportation has enacted plans to promote the development of CVs (NHTSA, 2014). Meanwhile, the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has made significant progress under the support of technological advancement and policy incentives, leading to the prediction that EVs will account for around 30% of vehicle sales in 2030 (IEA, 2019).====Together, these technologies are expected to produce substantial benefits in supporting the future transport system (Burns, 2013). Connected and autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce crashes and fuel consumption (Gawron, Keoleian, De Kleine, Wallington, & Kim, 2018; Talebpour & Mahmassani, 2016). EVs can build upon the benefits of AVs by reducing costs and air pollution. The combination of AV and EV technology can produce a natural synergy that can make shared mobility more sustainable and marketable (Chen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016). Although these technologies have the potential to produce widespread benefits, uncertainty pertaining to technology, policy, public acceptance, liability, and privacy still impair their development (Walker & Marchau, 2017). Public acceptance is a precondition of the adoption of new technology, as it relates to the demand for technology, government policies, and infrastructure investments (Howard & Dai, 2014). Some studies have been conducted to understand consumer attitudes towards new technologies in vehicles (AVs, CVs), including use intention, willingness to pay, policy effects, and barriers (Bansal & Kockelman, 2018; Schoettle & Sivak, 2014a, 2014b). However, there is a lack of research on attitudes towards autonomous, connected, and electric vehicles (ACEVs).====The development of EVs, CVs, and AVs have proceeded at a rapid pace in China. Since 2009, the Chinese government has introduced several policies to encourage the deployment of so-called new energy vehicles (Qiao, 2014). Under the support of the central government, China surpassed the US as the largest EV market in 2016, and by 2018, over 2.3 million EVs were on the road (this accounts for roughly half of the total global stock) (IEA, 2019). Besides, EVs are projected to make up between 28% and 42% of all vehicle sales in 2030 (IEA, 2019). In 2017, the government launched a long-term development plan for the automotive industry, which is based on a shift towards electric, intelligent, and connected vehicle technologies (MIIT, 2017). According to this plan, it is planned that new vehicles with different levels of automation shall exceed 50% in 2020 and reach 80% in 2025, and connected driving assistance shall reach 10% in 2020. In 2018, the government issued guidelines to set industry standards about intelligent and connected vehicles (MIIT, 2018). At the same time, Beijing was the first city to allow road tests for AVs (BMCT, 2018). Clements and Kockelman (2017) pointed out that AV technology will produce economic ripple effects once it reaches a non-trivial market, including increased employment, industrial reorganization, and diverse automated travel forms. In China and other developing countries, the adoption of AVs may bring tremendous economic benefits, as it can disentangle the relationship between economic development and transport infrastructure (Bagloee et al., 2016). Prior to the advent of autonomous vehicles, it is crucial to understand the attitudes of consumers towards this technology.====This paper focuses on autonomous, connected, and electric vehicles (ACEVs), which integrate the characteristics of AVs, CVs, and EVs. Considering the development of ACEVs in China, understanding consumer attitudes towards ACEVs is necessary at this stage of their development; this understanding can be used to inform technology deployment, industry planning, and investment schemes. This study utilizes a survey to obtain consumer attitudes towards ACEVs, including the evaluation of benefits, concerns, and barriers regarding ACEVs. An ordered logit model is used to explore factors on consumers’ adoption behavior of ACEVs.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related research on AVs with a focus on public attitude and influential factors. The survey design, data collection process, and sample profile are presented in Section 3. Section 4 analyzes attitudes towards automation levels and vehicle types. Then, it presents a summary of the perception of the benefits, concerns, and adoption barriers of ACEVs. A model is presented to understand the adoption of ACEVs. Section 5 discusses the results and limitations of this paper.

While the local airline provides direct travel utility only, the hub carrier provides additional, indirect travel utility from network density benefits. As the density benefits increase along with market concentration, they formally capture the dilemma of hub concentration. In equilibrium, the hub carrier is dominant but its network remains inefficiently small. Thus, the three common allocation instruments yield ambiguous welfare results: Airport slots only restore efficiency when a use obligation enforces slot utilization, secondary slot trading leads to market preemption by the hub carrier while the network undersize persists, and congestion ","“Economic regulation introduces its own distortions, and at the end of the day, there is a trade-off to be made between imperfect competition and imperfect regulation.” (Starkie, 2008, p. 135).====At major European airports, congestion is managed based on a slot allocation that prioritizes the grandfathering rights of incumbent airlines and existing air routes.==== However, both in the literature and in practice, this regulation is criticized as to represent a market entry barrier, neglect the social value of airport capacity, and prevent competition at the expense of the consumers, thereby causing an inefficient resource allocation of scarce airport capacity (e.g., De Wit & Burghouwt, 2008, p. 152, Gillen & Morrison, 2008, p. 174, Kilian, 2008, p. 255, Matthews & Menaz, 2008, p. 24, or Daniel, 2009, p. 22). Moreover, it is judged to deviate from EU policy paradigms such as the user-pays-principle and non-discrimination (Van Reeven, 2005, p. 711).====In response, a number of studies proposes two alternative instruments for airport capacity allocation: congestion pricing, which aims at internalizing the congestion externalities, and secondary slot trading, which aims at an efficient allocation by introducing opportunity costs for slots, so that those carriers buy slots who most efficiently use them.==== According to economic theory, quotas (slots), congestion pricing, and secondary trading are efficient under perfect competition with homogenous goods but may include welfare caveats when market power prevails (e.g., Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green 1995, p. 351 and 356). Correspondingly, Hong and Harker (1992), Daniel (1995), (2001), and (2009), or Czerny (2010) confirm the allocation efficiency of alternative instruments in perfectly competitive markets with homogenous products. In addition, Brueckner (2008), (2009), and Basso and Zhang (2010) extend the above efficiency results to imperfect competition settings with inelastic demand, which formally removes the market power distortion. By contrast, Brueckner, 2002a, Brueckner, 2002b, Brueckner and Van Dender (2008), and Verhoef (2010) address the inefficiencies caused by suboptimal output due to market power.====However, major airports that host a dominant airline with a hub-and-spoke network structure may depart from imperfect competition with homogenous goods in various ways: On the one hand, a network airline may offer network benefits based on hub feeding and scale economies, such as an ample destination choice and high flight frequencies, which offer a better connectivity, wider market coverage, and lower schedule delays on individual routes as compared to a local airline that provides point-to-point services based on local demand only. On the other hand, such product differentiation may constitute a comparative advantage against a non-networking competitor. Hence, as Berry (1990, p.394) notes, airline competition may involve both “traditional market power” as well as product differentiation based on airport presence. In addition, the quest for market power and scarcity rents may lead to strategic airline behavior such as, slot hoarding or slot purchases with the goal of entry deterrence (Hueschelrath, 2008, p. 1 or Matthews & Menaz, 2008, p. 36). Consequently, at a concentrated network hub that exhibits an asymmetric market structure with a dominant hub carrier, the allocation of airport capacity may not only need to account for imperfect competition but also for vertical product differentiation and strategic behavior.====As the above studies consider the flights of different airlines as homogenous products, only few models incorporate market asymmetries: E.g., Verhoef (2010) considers a cost difference between two airlines and Brueckner and Van Dender (2008) consider an asymmetry by assumption. Hence, the investigation of airport capacity allocation with demand-side, vertical product differentiation between asymmetric airlines received little attention as of yet. Therefore, the study at hand investigates the efficiency of airport capacity allocation in a theoretical model where a stylized, dominant network airline faces a non-networking competitor at its network hub, thereby featuring vertical product differentiation under imperfect competition. For this purpose, the framework extends Brueckner's symmetric (2002a) discrete-choice model with heterogenous travel utility and congestion externalities to an asymmetric market structure, where both airlines provide direct travel benefits from air transportation whereas additional, indirect travel benefits from network density accrue to the passengers of the hub carrier only. These indirect benefits are generic but are supposed to arise from network benefits such as, e.g., a wide destination choice and high flight frequencies, so that the hub carrier may offer better connectivity and lower schedule delays than the local point-to-point airline. As in Brueckner (2002a), the passengers may travel during an uncongested off-peak period or a congested peak period, where airport congestion induces both airline congestion costs and passenger time costs.====Firstly, the unconstrained equilibrium reveals that the hub-carrier is dominant but both airlines operate during the peak period; this first-come, first-served allocation is inefficient due to traditional market power, congestion externalities, and an undersized network. Secondly, due to the asymmetric market structure, the social optimum requires a planner to allocate all slots to the hub carrier exclusively. Without a use obligation, these individual quotas increase the network size but also the market power distortion, so that the network undersize persists. Hence, in theory, a slot use obligation restores the social optimum.==== Thirdly, in a secondary trading scheme, the local airline would always become the seller because it can never afford purchasing slots from the hub carrier. Hence, in the unilateral initial allocation, the hub carrier remains the sole supplier in the peak-period whereas, in the contrasting case of a symmetric initial allocation, the hub carrier would preempt the peak-period market by buying all the slots of the local airline.==== In both cases, the implementation of a use obligation determines whether the network remains undersized or becomes optimal. Hence, secondary trading fosters market concentration and reduces competition while it fails to restore efficiency. Lastly, for congestion pricing, the network density benefits aggravate Brueckner's (2002a) welfare caveat because taxing the congestion externality would increase market power and decrease the network size; the compensation of those two inefficiencies would require a subsidy instead of a tax.","Airport slots, secondary trading, and congestion pricing at an airport with a dominant network airline",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919303282,28 February 2020,2020,Research Article,269.0

It mainly depends on country characteristics, especially soft and hard infrastructure, and institutions that are required to operate well, such as imports, regulations, procedures, and behaviors (Arvis et al., 2016).====The World Bank publishes every two years the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) which measures the logistics performance of countries (Arvis et al., 2016). It considers the opinions of logistics professionals to evaluate the logistics performance of 160 countries across six indicators: customs, infrastructure, international shipments, service quality, tracking and tracing, and timeliness. The strategic position of Turkey between Europe and Asia makes it a natural transport hub for the East, the West, and Africa. That is why potential improvements in its logistic competitiveness constitute a competitive advantage for international trade.====When the logistic competitiveness of Turkey was investigated in 2016, its logistic performance was the 34th and one of its worst performance ratings (the 40th) was the timeliness indicator (Arvis et al., 2016). Efficient border management, along with decreased waiting times, can facilitate trade. In fact, in a former study, Ozaydin et al. (2017) investigated the current situation of the border crossing performance of Europe's busiest and the world's second-busiest land border crossing point Kapıkule Border Crossing that connects Turkey to Europe and has a vital role for the international trade between Europe and Asia. The crossing point is located in Edirne Province on the border of Turkey and Bulgaria (Fig. 1). It encounters serious problems due to the long truck queues, especially on weekends.====Turkey is a country at the crossroads of the new Silk Road, which would be redeveloped as the Belt and Road Initiative, the most ambitious infrastructure project the world has ever known, connecting China to Europe. When this project is finalized, the traffic flow due to international trade will increase significantly. This is why the efficiency of border crossings between Turkey and Europe is of primary importance.====Turkish authorities, being aware of this new challenge, made important efforts to improve the efficiency of border-crossing operations. Since that point, they have been modernizing Turkey's border crossings based on the “build-operate-transfer” model. For instance, in 2005, Customs and Tourism Enterprises Co. Inc. (Gümrük ve Turizm Işletmeleri Ticaret A. Ş) established the framework for a partnership between the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (Türkiye Odalar ve Borsalar Birliği) and 137 Chambers and Commodity Exchanges. Starting its activities with the modernization of the Habur border crossing, Customs and Tourism Enterprises Co. Inc. swiftly completed the reconstruction and renovation of Kapıkule, Cilvegözü, Sarp, and Hamzabeyli border crossings.====Regarding the critical external borders of the European Union (EU), The International Road Transport Union Border Waiting Times Observatory (2009) suggests initiating several action plans in order to reduce the waiting time at the borders. Examples of actions plans may include providing 24/7-day control service availability, extending control staff capacities, reducing the number of control services present at the border, improving coordination between the two sides of the frontier, moving all controls away from borders, introducing joint border control technologies between neighboring countries, applying Single Window and risk management technology, implementing modern information and traffic management systems, etc.====To increase the efficiency of the crossing at the Kapıkule Border Crossing, Ozaydin et al. (2017) initially examined the current state deriving the corresponding process flows. Subsequently, based on these process flows, they simulated the system using Arena software. In their paper, several action plans were determined to represent improvement strategies for the import and export processes. They also tested the impacts of those action plans on solely the number and waiting times of trucks at the Kapıkule Border Crossing. As can be seen from the previous studies, there are several action plans that can be used to increase the efficiency of the border crossing and due to budget restrictions, the governments cannot initiate both simultaneously. Therefore, developing a prioritization scheme taking different criteria into account is of vital importance. That's why, in this study, a multi-criteria decision-making approach was used.====The basic aim of this study is to specify the priorities to be given to different action plans evaluated in Ozaydin et al. (2017) not only based on the number and the waiting times of trucks but on a much broader set of attributes. The research question is how to prioritize the different action plans for expediting the traffic flow at Kapıkule Border Crossing based on the number and waiting time of the trucks, investment cost, operation cost, sustainability, the satisfaction of beneficiaries and border security. The basic contribution of this research is to provide a road map to the policymakers to decide on which action plan to focus on and in which priority in order to expedite the traffic flow taking into account social, environmental and economic aspects of the problem. Such a road map will be of great support to develop an efficient implementation plan to ease the traffic congestion taking into account the different dimensions of the issue.====Although there are many ideas for the stages regarding the decision-making process (Al-Shemmeri, Al-Kloub, & Pearman, 1997; Henig & Buchanan, 1996; Jacquet-Lagreze & Shakun, 1984; Kirkwood, 1997; Munda, 1993), in this study, three main stages, namely, problem structuring, decision modeling, and decision analysis, were conducted as suggested by Hodgkin, Belton, and Buchanan (2000), Hodgkin, Belton, and Koulouri (2005), Belton and Stewart (2002), and Ulengin, Topcu, and Onsel Sahin (2001).====In the problem structuring stage, we identified the alternatives which were improvement action plans and the attributes which would be used for evaluation. In the decision modeling stage, based on the judgments of the stakeholders, the importance of attributes was revealed. Additionally, we asked the stakeholders to evaluate the performance of alternatives with respect to the attributes identified in the first stage. Finally, in the decision analysis stage, we prioritized the alternatives, using a well-known and widely implemented multi-attribute decision-making method: PROMETHEE (an abbreviation for ====reference ====anking ====rganization ====od for ====nrichment of ====valuations) using the Visual PROMETHEE software (Mareschal, 2018). The prioritization of the alternatives was then presented to the authorities in a meeting held on October 18, 2017.====The basic reason for selecting the PROMETHEE method in this study is that the border crossing problem is a non-compensatory problem because the trade-off among social, environmental and economic aspects of the problem is not suitable. This means that good scores on other criteria cannot compensate for a very bad score on a single criterion, which is compatible with sustainability requirements. Therefore, the use of outranking methods is more appropriate. Outranking methods also introduce the relation of incomparability where two alternatives differ widely on a number of criteria. In the case of the evaluation of transport performance, it is reasonable to expect large differences, some of the alternatives may have economic advantages but serious environmental impacts, while other alternatives may have the opposite characteristics. In such situations, unlike other multi-criteria methods, the outranking approach does not allow conclusions to be drawn and introduces the relation of incomparability. On the other hand, criteria scores can be left in their own units, which is important when they are related to diverse domains, as is the case with sustainability; i.e., social, environmental and economic dimensions (Bojković, Anić, & Pejčić-Tarle, 2010). The details about the potential of the outranking approach in sustainability assessment at the macro level have been analyzed by Shmelev and Rodríguez-Labajos (2009). On the other hand, as will be seen in the literature survey, PROMETHEE is an outranking method that is widely applied in logistics and transportation problems (Behzadian, Kazemzadeh, Albadvi, & Aghdasi, 2010; Ulengin et al., 2001). That is why the PROMETHEE method is selected as the appropriate multi-criteria method in this study.====The paper is organized as follows: The second section presents the literature review on both border crossing and PROMETHEE applications in logistics and transportation. The third section provides the framework of the proposed approach and its application to Kapıkule Border Crossing is given in the fourth section. The fifth, sixth, and seventh sections elaborate on the stages of the proposed approach.

Local governments have made a huge investment in high-speed rail construction, aiming to promot economic agglomeration around stations by compressing spatial distance, and produce a ==== on the local economy. However, it still needs to test whether high-speed rail construction can change the development fate of these cities. In this paper, the economic impact of high-speed rail opening on these cities was examined by considering cities along China's “four vertical and four horizontal” high-speed rail lines as observation objects and using “night lighting data,” key economic indicators, and the difference-in-difference model with matching method. The following findings were obtained in our study. First, high-speed rail opening failed to promote the economic growth of cities along high-speed rails in the short term, but accelerated the economic diffusion of cities along high-speed rails over time. Second, high-speed rail opening had a significant impact on the industrial structure of cities along high-speed rails, increased the proportion of the tertiary ==== and reduced the proportion of the secondary ====. Third, high-speed rail construction exerted a greater influence on the economic development level of big cities and had no significant impact on the economic development level of small and medium-sized cities along the high-speed rails. In the robustness test, consistent results were obtained by replacing the economic growth measurement methods, changing the time breakpoint and conducting a counterfactual test.","In the new economic geography theory, the construction of traffic infrastructure is generally considered as one of the key drivers of economic growth. Historical data shows that the period of rapid economic growth in developed countries such as America and Western Europe overlapped with the period of rapid construction of their traffic infrastructure in history (Banerjee, Duflo, & Qian, 2012). In China, the government and the public seem to generally agree that the construction of roads or rails contributes to the diffusion of capital, talents, technology and other resources from central cities to small-scale edge cities so as to drive the industrialization and economic growth of edge cities and narrow interregional economic gaps. Based on such a background, the economic growth driven by China's large-scale construction of traffic infrastructure is a miniature percentage of China's 40-year investment-driven growth pattern(Ge et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2009). In terms of rail construction, China's rail operation mileage saw a 1.4-fold increase from 1978 to 2017, amounting to 127,000 km, and ranking second in the world. In addition to the rapid increase in rail operation mileage, there was also an increase in the running speed of rails. China started to use passenger trains with speeds of 200 km/h and 250 km/h in the national rail network from April 2007. China's first high-speed rail was formally completed and opened in 2008. At present, China has the longest mileage of high-speed rail operation and the largest scale of construction all around the world. By the end of 2017, China's operational mileage of high-speed rails had reached 25,000 km, accounting for 65% of the world's total mileage of high-speed rails.====High-speed rails are becoming the preferred travel mode by more and more Chinese. China has entered “an era of high-speed rails.” The large-scale investment, construction and operation of high-speed rail has not only changed China's passenger transport system and people's values and travel modes (Fu, Zhang, & Lei, 2012; Ma, Wang, Yang, Zhang, & Zhang, 2019), but also reconstructed China's spatial economic distribution unprecedentedly (Dong & Zhu, 2016). To better serve and support major national development strategies, the Chinese government re-revised ==== in 2016 and clearly proposed the construction of “eight vertical and eight horizontal” high-speed rail lines based on the previous “four vertical and four horizontal” high-speed rail network, to connect national high-speed rails into a network. To take the preemptive opportunities for development, local governments invested heavily in the construction of high-speed rails with the intention of promoting economic agglomeration around by compressing spatial distance and boosting local economic growth. However, the impact of high-speed rail construction on the economic growth of cities along high-speed rail seems to be uncertain according to available research evidence. Namely, some people argued that high-speed rail construction aimed to realize so-called “gains” through high debt costs. In 2018, China Railway Corporation's total debt had reached RMB 5 trillion yuan, 80% of which was associated with high-speed rail construction.====The large-scale construction and operation of high-speed rails in China provides a good case for examining the causal relationship between traffic infrastructure construction and economic growth. China has promoted the construction of “four vertical and four horizontal” high-speed rail network lines on a large scale since 2008. Our study will focus on the economic impact of this major development. However, most previous literature related to the impact of traffic infrastructure construction on regional economic development has exhibited a challenge with endogeneity. Namely, the planning of rail or highway routes is not exogenous. Some recent studies dealt well with the endogenous problems of high-speed rail construction (Xu & Nakajima, 2015; Qin, 2016; Zhou & Zheng, 2012). Based on these studies, our study will adopt the difference-in-difference with matching (PSM-DID) method to evaluate the impact of high-speed rail opening on urban economic development. Considering the measurement error of China's GDP, this paper used satellite lighting data as the proxy variable of local economic development level, and took advantage of other economic indicators to measure the impact of high-speed rail construction on the economic activities of cities along high-speed rails. Additionally, previous studies showed significant differences in the impact of high-speed rails on the spatial structure of urban systems, due to the differences in the high-speed rail opening time, the grade and type of connected cities, the traffic infrastructure development level, and other aspects. This study will also focus on the impact of high-speed rails on different city types based on past studies.====Can the opening of high-speed rail bring economic growth to cities? Does the high-speed rail have different impacts on different industries? Is the impact of high-speed rail on urban economy related to the type and characteristics of cities? Our research will answer these questions; which are faced not only by China but also by other countries internationally. As the conclusion of this study, the hopes of achieving economic growth promotion through high-speed rail seem to be invalid in the short term. In the short term, the spillover effect caused by high-speed rail may be greater than the agglomeration effect. In China, the improvement of high-speed rails for accessibility is a hot subject of study, but these studies cannot accurately evaluate the “advantages” and “disadvantages” brought by high-speed rails to urban and regional development. Meanwhile, China is in a period of rapid urbanization and economic transition, which may make the impact of high-speed rails on city's economy different from those in other countries. Therefore, scientifically evaluating the impact of high-speed rails on the economic growth of cities is beneficial to evaluate the economic and spatial effects of high-speed rail construction more objectively. At the same time, this study can provide a valuable reference for the construction of high-speed rail in other countries, in order to better deal with the risks and uncertainties brought by high-speed rail to the urban economy.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. section 2 is the literature review.

Transit-oriented development (TOD) emphasizes using built-environment factors such as mixed-use, density, and walkability, to maximize the benefits of improving transit accessibility. Although studies illustrate how transit-oriented built-environments amplify the rail transit impact on housing prices within the American context, little attention has been paid to Chinese cities. Using a case study of Wuhan City in China, this study shows that a higher transit proximity premium of housing prices is more likely to occur in the place with more mixed land uses. Policy implications on TOD planning and land value capture near transit station areas are derived.","The rail transit system is an important element of urban sustainability which depends on the ability of citizens to access goods and services (Yen, Mulley, Shearer, & Burke, 2018). Rail transit is becoming increasingly significant to urban growth and sustainability in China since China is investing more than 2 trillion yuan in urban rail transit during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020) (Sina, 2018). The operating length will increase from about 5000 km by 2017 to 6600 km by 2020 (China Association of Metro Transit, 2017, 2018). Due to the huge local debt incurred from rail transit construction, the central government recently adopt stricter criteria for rail transit application: cities need to have economic volume and fiscal revenue twice more than previously required. To be specific, a city needs to have at least 30 billion yuan annual revenue in public budget and 300 billion yuan GDP per year to be considered as the candidate for metro construction, while the previous minimum requirements are 10 billion yuan revenue and 100 billion yuan GDP (General Office of State Council, 2018). Therefore a better cost-benefit balance of rail transit construction is an important consideration for Chinese cities. The improvement of accessibility brought by rail transit construction can be capitalized in the form of property value uplift according to classic land economics theory (Alonso, 1964). Knowledge about the effect of rail transit on property values has important implications for the potential implementation of land value capture policy as the funding mechanism for new transport infrastructure (Dziauddin, Powe, & Alvanides, 2015).====Rail transit effects are heterogenous since built-environments within cities vary. Transit-oriented development (TOD) emphasizes not only transit accessibility but also sustainable built-environments featuring mixed-use, density, and walkability (ITDP 2013). Mixed-use, density, and walkability are important moderators amplifying the magnitude of the rail transit impact on housing prices (Bartholomew & Ewing, 2011), as identified in San Diego (Cervero & Duncan, 2002; Duncan, 2011a, 2011b), Phoenix (Atkinson-Palombo, 2010), Los Angeles (Zhong & Li, 2016), and Atlanta (Bowes and Ihlandfedlt 2001). However, to our best knowledge, there are no studies on Chinese cities examining the synergic property value effect between transit-oriented built-environments and transit accessibility.====This study fills this gap by investigating the amplifying effects of the transit-oriented environments, i.e. mixed-use, density, and walkability, on transit proximity premium of housing prices in Wuhan, China. We choose Wuhan as the study area since Wuhan has intensively invested in rail transit system, but the associated impact has been a debate: Huang and Yin (2015) identified the negative influence of the rail transit proximity on housing prices in Wuhan while Xu and Zhang (2016) found the impact of the rail transit on housing prices is positive. Furthermore, none of these studies examine the spatial variation of transit impact on housing prices. This study employs the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model with interaction terms and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model to capture the local variation of transit effects in terms of transit-oriented built-environments. Considering China has been investing heavily in urban rail transit, a better understanding of the synergistic value effect between transit proximity and built-environments can provide insights into the TOD strategy and help policymakers develop the strategy with a higher government revenue.","Effects of transit-oriented development (TOD) on housing prices: A case study in Wuhan, China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300020,10 February 2020,2020,Research Article,273.0

The decision is the result of 40 years’ discussion, which is outlined in the paper.====The paper places the final decision in a theoretical framework of Greenland as a peripheral and very remote country for which air travel is the only way of mobility. Literature from the latest ten years shows that improvement in air travel can contribute to economic development. On the other hand, the investment in the new airports is economically risky considered the small size of the economy. The paper therefore uses ==== (CBA) to assess if the decision is cost-effective even without the induced and wider economic effects of the new airports, which are difficult to forecast.====Based on several CBA developed over the years, the decision on the airport package seems to be cost-effective in case some of the induced effects are taken into account. For the capital Nuuk, the decision is clearly cost-effective without including induced effects. For Ilulissat, the effect depends on to what extent an airline is willing to follow up and establish a new direct connection from Europe or the American east coast. Therefore, airport authorities are also recommended to ‘sell’ the new airports to airlines.====During the 40-year long process of discussion, the authors’ institute was 15 years ago asked to develop an optimization model for air traffic in Greenland. This model (the TGB model) is described in the paper and it is concluded that it would be possible to improve the network and save annual subsidies to the internal service traffic (PSO). Unfortunately, the model was never implemented. The authors recommend to update and improve the model that is currently outdated and to use it to optimize the network when the new airports are finished.","After 40 years of discussion about new airports, a majority of the Greenlandic Parliament decided in November 2018==== to invest 3500 million DKK==== in an airport package. The airport package includes two international airports with new/extended 2200 m runways at the capital Nuuk and at Ilulissat that is located in the most attractive part of the country for tourism. Furthermore, it includes a new regional airport with a 1500 m runway at Qaqortoq close to the southern point of Greenland. Currently (August 2019), no decision has been taken with respect to the future of the two existing international airports at Kangerlussuaq and Narsarsuaq. A committee has been set up to analyse the problems and to present suggestions to the Parliament.====Compared to the economy of Greenland, the investment is huge, corresponding to 40% of the country's annual GDP. On the other hand, the geographical conditions of Greenland do not allow interurban road transport and only slow - and during winter unstable - sea transport along the coast. Air transport therefore plays a central role for the society. The improvement of the infrastructure of the country and the time savings for inhabitants, visiting tourists, and business travellers is substantial.====The airport infrastructure has been analysed and discussed seriously for the last 30 years in Greenland without any decision having been taken until now. In a historical perspective the need for serving different parts of the big country has made it difficult to decide to locate a new airport in one part of the country without considering the needs of other parts. Furthermore, the demand from other public affairs has been important, too.====From a technical perspective the air traffic network is the life nerve of mobility, communication and trade. It is however complicated to optimize the network. At a certain time during the long considerations, DTU Transport at the Technical University of Denmark was asked to develop a model to analyse alternative solutions. Up till now, the model has not been in use even though it was shown that it is possible to obtain big savings and improvements of the transport system. When the new airports are ready it might be possible to optimize the network in order to reduce the cost of the public service obligations (PSO) for serving the rest of the country. Furthermore, the home rule authorities and politicians have often discussed missing competition, which has been seen as a reason for a probably unneeded high demand for PSO from the national budget. This question will therefore be addressed, too.====The paper at hand presents the background for the decision in both a historical and technical perspective.

The development in the official cost benefit analyses and the changing recommendations they caused will therefore be a main question in the historical presentation.====An important observation is that it has never seriously been considered to include secondary and wider economic effects of airports in the decision process; they are only assessed in a few of the analyses. The consequence of not considering secondary and wider economic effects, especially from tourism will therefore be another question discussed in the paper based on the newest literature about airport infrastructure's wider economic effect on development in remote and peripheral regions.====Below, the geography, the infrastructure and the air traffic network are presented with the purpose of better understanding the background of the decided investment.

We propose an operative methodology to apply standard costs in the allocation of national public resources available for the local public bus transport services to Regions and, in turn, to Local Authorities. Moreover, we perform simulations to illustrate the impact of this methodology in terms of reallocation of national public resources among Local Authorities. Based on certified data, results of this paper fill a severe knowledge gap and support (i) policy makers when it comes to allocate public resources, as well as competition authorities in their market assessment and scholars aimed at investigates this prominent topic.","In recent years, many countries have introduced new industry reforms and competitive tendering procedures in the local public transport (LPT) industry, in order to enhance productivity and reduce huge deficits. LPT services can be classified as services of general economic interest, which are economic activities that public authorities identify as being of particular importance to citizens and that would not be supplied (or would be supplied under different conditions) if there were no public intervention. One matter central to these reform initiatives is the definition of a set of rules that the provider of the service must obey in order deliver to the market the best possible service levels consistent with stakeholder needs, as well reimbursement and risk sharing schemes. Reimbursement systems usually reward service providers with respect to service obligations in public transport service provision, at efficient cost levels, achieved through best-practice benchmarking and with provision for appropriate incentive/penalty clauses related to specific service delivery elements if desired.====In some countries, public funds allotted to reward service providers are provided both at a national (centralized) level and at a regional (decentralized) level. Thus, a proper distribution of public funds for LPT should be based on the costs of an efficient operator and a methodology that does not build differential inefficiencies across regions. In this process, regulated in Europe by the Directive 1370/07/EU, the Italian Parliament devised a number of interventions aimed at gauging a more efficient use of scarce public financial resources available for the LPT services. The industry reform goes as follows. Each of the 20 Italian Regions constitutes autonomously a Regional fund for the financing of LPT services offered in its territories. Public resources that feed each Regional fund are provided in part by the State and in part by the Region itself. The State defines on a yearly basis the total amount of national public resources destined to LPT services and the share of these resources to be allotted to each Region. Then, each Region can freely integrate such amount with own resources in order to improve the quantity and/or quality of LPT services produced in its territories. In order to pursue the goal of a fairer distribution and a more efficient use of national (scarce) public financial resources, the Italian Parliament decided to apply the instrument of the standard cost in the allocation of such resources. Standard costs should reflect the cost of a LPT service with a specified service quality and provided by an efficient operator, where the “efficiency levels” are defined on the basis of the activities and costs of several operators and/or of knowledge of the industrial process for the provision of LPT services. LPT operators might improve their cost-efficiency on the principle of yardstick competition (Shleifer, 1985), since they are residual claimant of the profits accruing from the difference between the industry yardstick and their costs, if lower. In particular, Law 216/2010 disciplines the allocation of national public resources among Local Authorities through the determination of unit standard costs, defined as total cost per vehicle-kilometre offered to the passengers. Subsequently, Law 228/2012 establishes a national public fund to contribute to the financing of LPT services (====), whose allocation must be accomplished by taking into account principles that encourage efficiency, such that standard costs.====In such a scenario, this work contributes to the literature and to the policy debate by developing a methodology based on standard costs for the allotment of national public resources earmarked to local public bus transport services (from hereon LPBT services) among the 15 Italian Regions with ordinary statute.====A detailed methodology for the determination of unit standard costs of LPT services in Italy has been developed since 2013 by a Working Group set up by the Unified Conference, an Italian institution aimed at organizing the collaboration between State and Local Authorities, on the basis of the data gathered by the national LPT Observatory.==== As regards LPBT services, some cost models consistent with the methodology proposed by the Working Group have been formally described in Avenali, Boitani, Catalano, D’Alfonso, and Matteucci (2014, 2016, 2018). However, up to the present date, an appropriate and definitive methodology for the application of standard costs in the allocation of the national public fund among Regions and Local Authorities is not available.====More in detail, the methodology proposed in this paper applies the results provided in Avenali, Boitani, Catalano, D’Alfonso, and Matteucci (2016) – where a Top-Down model is estimated to determine unit standard costs for the Italian LPBT services – to a dataset representative of 1.46 billion of bus revenue kilometres provided in Italy in 2014.==== The dataset gathered by the national LPT Observatory contains information about type (urban or intercity), size (bus revenue kilometres) and average commercial speed for each LPBT service contract. This allows us to determine a realistic reallocation of national public resources allotted in 2014 for LPBT services among the 15 Regions with ordinary statute. The proposed reallocation shares the national public fund by taking into account an estimate of the financial needs for the Region in the case that the LPBT services are provided by efficient operators.====The paper is organized as follows.

The results show that after the opening of the city subway, per capita traffic energy consumption decreased, indicating that subways reduce energy consumption in urban areas; there exists a “U” relationship between metro operation intensity and per capita traffic energy consumption. The average level is far from the inflection point value, which indicates that an increase in metro operation intensity has the effect of improving traffic energy consumption. However, the marginal benefit of reducing urban traffic energy consumption is gradually decreasing. Further research has found that the metro system can reduce the distance travelled by cars by replacing the use of traditional automobile transportation, thus reducing transportation energy consumption.","Since the reform and opening-up, China's economic development has achieved remarkable results. However, for a long time, China's economic growth has led to a sharp rise in energy consumption at the expense of high energy input and high consumption. According to the “BP World Energy Statistical Yearbook”, China's energy consumption reached 3,053 million tons of oil equivalent in 2016, more than the 780 million of the United States, becoming the largest in the world. One of the important factors leading to China's high total energy consumption is that urbanization has led to a significant increase in energy consumption in cities (Lei, Cheng, Gunson, & Hui, 2005). Studies have found that China's urban energy consumption accounts for more than 75% of total energy consumption. The per capita energy consumption of urban residents is about seven times that of rural residents (Dhakal, 2009). Within the city, the transportation system is one of the primary generators of energy consumption, and the proportion of urban transportation energy consumption as regards the whole is still increasing (Zhou et al., 2012). Such a high consumption of energy has severely constrained the quality of economic growth; moreover, any growth model that relies on high energy consumption needs to eventually be transformed. In ikresponse, the 19th National Congress report proposed “constructing a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system” to ensure the sustainable development of the economy and society. We can thus see that reducing energy consumption has become one of the important measures for transforming the current model of economic growth and achieving high-quality economic development. Therefore, at this stage, it is important to examine how to reduce urban transportation energy consumption, so as to reduce overall energy consumption, implement sustainable development strategies, and improve the quality of economic development (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).====As the scale of cities continues to expand, China's urban road transportation system is becoming increasingly complex. At present, China's largest cities, determined by a population of more than five million, have experienced varying degrees of traffic oversaturation (Yang, Li, Zhang, & Liu, 2014) and traffic congestion has become a normal phenomenon. Therefore, the development of underground railways has received more attention. Over the past 10 years, with local governments strengthening and upgrading urban transportation networks, the underground railway systems in Chinese cities have developed rapidly. The number of cities that have opened subways has expanded from the original three cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, to more than 20 cities. The “Three-Year Action Plan for Major Construction of Transportation Infrastructure”, released in 2016, pointed out that in the next three years, the preliminary work of 103 urban rails will be initiated and the country's new urban subway line will be more than 2,000 km, requiring a total investment of 1.6 trillion yuan. The development of urban subway systems has the potential to drive the transformation of the current model of development and affect the functional layout of the entire urban economy. They will also change the way personnel are transferred, thus affecting urban transportation energy consumption. On the one hand, the opening of subways has changed the way urban residents travel and shortened time and space distances within the city, reducing travel distances and the usage of traditional motor vehicles; this has improved the structure of energy consumption by replacing oil with electricity (Chen & Whalley, 2012). On the other hand, the metro system is huge and complex, and the power consumed by its operation is also very large. Large-scale metro operations increase the power consumption in cities. Based on this, exploring the impact of the development of subway systems on transportation energy consumption is important for moving toward higher-quality economic growth. This paper attempts to use the DID method (which is used to compare and evaluate the impact of a policy before and after implementation) to study the impact of the metro system on urban traffic energy consumption before and after the opening of a city subway.",Empirical study on the impact of China's metro services on urban transportation energy consumption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073988592030010X,5 February 2020,2020,Research Article,276.0

This has led to insufficient concern of the socio-economic and environmental costs and benefits of track maintenance. Given the pressure to increase track utilisation, the ageing infrastructure of railway networks, constrained maintenance budgets, the vertical separation of the ownership and operation of railway track infrastructure and rolling stock in many countries, and concerns about the ","Railways are a major component of a sustainable transport policy in many countries since they are considered as green, efficient and a safe mode of transportation. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for the railway industry to expand capacity, availability and to transport goods and people at higher speeds. By 2025, railways are expected to carry 11,912 billion tonne-kilometre of freight and 5149 billion passenger-kilometre worldwide, increases of 14.75% and 37.2% respectively from 2015 (SCI, 2017). However, in many countries, investment in the expansion of railway infrastructure has not kept up with the demand for increased usage. In the United Kingdom for example, passenger journeys have increased by approximately 4.8% between 2010-11 and 2016-17 without any significant increase in the amount of railway infrastructure, making the UK railways Europe's second highest congested railway network (ORR, 2017a). Similarly, during the same period passenger numbers in the United States have risen by 11% with only a 4.8% increase in railway track length (APTA, 2017) and in India the corresponding figures are 6.0% and 4.5% respectively (MoIR, 2016). Such increasing track usage will result in faster degradation and therefore higher maintenance costs. For example, the spending on maintaining railway track infrastructure in USA (FRA Class 1 rail roads), UK and India during 2016-17 was $9.8 million, $775 million and $2.08 billion respectively, which was 1.2%, 3.8% and 24% higher than in the previous year (AAR, 2016; MoIR, 2017; ORR, 2017b).====There is therefore an increasing pressure for railway infrastructure maintainers to make the best use of their available resources. For traditional ballasted railway track in particular, railway track maintenance directly affects the condition of the railway track and therefore, the likelihood of accidents, rolling stock fuel and maintenance costs, travel time costs and emissions. A well-maintained track not only guarantees ride comfort and safety but also increases the life of the track as well as track availability (due to the lack of imposition of speed limits). Therefore, to enable a green, efficient and safe railway system there is a need for effective asset management which systematically considers Whole Life Cycle Costs (WLCC) and benefits over the lifetime of the asset (See Fig. 1) (ISO, 2017). Such an approach helps to identify cost drivers and cost-effective improvements, enables the comparison of alternative maintenance strategies and the prioritization of maintenance funds (Jun et al., 2007).====Currently however, maintenance decisions for ballasted railway infrastructure are largely based on time, tonnage or predetermined subjective maintenance standards, which ignore the costs of operation and maintenance. Thus, they fail to optimise maintenance interventions and therefore do not deliver maximum benefits (Atkins, 2011). This culture is gradually changing for the reasons described above and the sector is moving towards preventative condition-based maintenance (van Noortwijk et al., 2004). The publication of asset management standards and guidelines, which advocate WLCC, approaches, including ISO 15686-5 and EN 60300-3-3 has added additional impetus. As a result, railway infrastructure and rolling stock organisations have started to develop their own asset management tools which incorporate some WLCC principles. These initiatives have been supported by academic research, a summary of which is presented in Table 1.====There are, however, a number of limitations of the suggested approaches to track substructure maintenance shown in Table 1. In particular, they do not consider all transport costs which, as well as future railway track infrastructure maintenance costs, should also take into account railway track use costs and mode change costs. Railway track use costs include rolling stock operation costs (i.e. fuel consumption and maintenance costs), capacity lost costs, accident costs and environmental impacts. Mode change costs are those associated with the change in use of rail compared to other modes (primarily road and air) due to track infrastructure investment. However, Whole Life Cycle Cost Analysis (WLCCA) approach requires predicting these future costs and benefits of railway track. For existing railway track in particular there is often a paucity of construction, condition and historical maintenance data. This makes future predictions of track deterioration, and therefore track condition and track use costs uncertain (Andrade, 2016; Andrews, 2012; Asplund, 2016; Kirkwood, Giuntini, & Baguley, 2016; Skinner, Kirwan, & Williams, 2011). It is under conditions of uncertainty that decision makers must evaluate, compare and select among alternative strategies, the economically justifiable one. To address these issues, this paper describes a WLCCA approach under uncertainty to determine the most economically beneficial railway track substructure maintenance strategy for traditional ballasted railway track. To this end, the proposal approach provides railway policy and decision makers, for the first time, a means to appraise maintenance investment strategies by considering environmental, safety, social and economic costs and benefits.",A whole life cycle approach under uncertainty for economically justifiable ballasted railway track maintenance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300044,31 January 2020,2020,Research Article,278.0

Literature reviews indicate that there are more studies on the impact of rail-based infrastructure than bus-based one (see Deng & Nelson, 2011; Stokenberga, 2014; Ingvardson and Nielsen 2018). This can be in part due to the extension of that latter type of transport investment, mainly in the last few years.====Part of the expansion of BRT can be attributed to its cost-effectiveness. In general, as shown in Ingvardson and Nielsen (2018), there are no substantial differences in the effect of rail and BRT on property values, but BRT deployment requires relatively low infrastructure and time costs both in absolute terms and as compared to rail systems. According to ITDP (2014), BRT's capital costs are less than 10 per cent of the cost of metro and 30–60 per cent of the cost of light rail. BRT also passes the test of a benefit-cost evaluation. Even though buses have generally a negative reputation related to pollution and slow service, BRT has allowed changes on both grounds. Indeed, BRT's benefits may result in positive impacts as a decrease in motorization, road safety, crime rates, travel time, greenhouse gases, and, an increase in land value. Even if, in general, transport infrastructure investments are made without a precise understanding of their returns, there is usually a great interest to assess their economic impacts. In particular, quantifying if there is land value uplift is seen as a way to encourage funding for such projects.====In Argentina, the first BRT system was implemented in Buenos Aires (capital city) by May 2011, and since then, similar ones have been introduced in different locations of the country's capital and in several provinces (states). Despite this, there are no published studies quantifying the impact of transport improvements on properties’ values in Argentina. This contrasts with available estimations for various countries, including developing cities as, for example, Bogotá in Colombia (Muñoz-Raskin, 2010; Perdomo, 2011; Rodríguez & Mojica, 2009) or Beijing (Ma, Ye, & Titheridge, 2014; Pang & Jiao, 2015; Zhang & Wang, 2013) and Guangzhou (Salon, Wu, & Shewmake, 2014) in China.====This paper seeks to examine the extent to which the Metrobus 9 de Julio on the main street of the city of Buenos Aires has any impact on property values in the surrounding area.==== Our paper contributes to the literature in two main aspects.

From ports, international supply chains can be structured based on the digitization of the supply and demand of logistics services and cargo information flows. Modern ports focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chains, developing PCSs that support information on demand forecasting and level of response to orders, and minimizing inventory costs. Online monitoring and transparency are increasingly critical to the success of supply chains and ports.====The modern scope of logistics entails greater complexity in port sector processes and a high number of stakeholders, which requires the innovation of port communication, information flows and documentation control. The maritime supply chain has evolved in recent years, supported by information and communication technologies (ICTs). This evolution has promoted a more intense integration of the port community and has imposed greater requirements on the provision of port services. Investment in ICTs for ports entails the adoption of paperless communication between members of the port community, integration with logistics partners and cooperation between different ports. This is a necessary step towards competitiveness that ports must take.====Port Community System (PCS) is the technological platform that enables networking between the public and private agents and entities involved in the ship and cargo services offered by ports. Rondon & Ramis-Pujol (2007) described the PCS as an electronic platform that links multiple systems of several companies and entities, which constitute the port community, and whose main function is to digitize port operations Few studies in the field of information systems have examined PCSs (Applegate, Siong, Bartlett, & Chang-Leow, 2001, pp. 1–34; Carlan, Sys, Calatayud, & Vanelslander, 2018; Carlan, Sys, & Vanelslander, 2016; Carlan, Sys, Vanelslander, & Roumboustsos, 2017; Hock-Hai, Bernard, & Kwok-kee, 1997; King, Harsh, & Dobbins, 1990; Mcafee, Ooms-Wall, & Al Qasimi, 2003, pp. 1–19; van Baalen, van Oosterhout, Tan, & van Heck, 2000).

However, few researchers have systematically addressed the importance of PCS characteristics and the effect on port performance. Carlan et al.

EU exports to Turkey are dominated by machinery and transport material, chemical products and manufactured goods. However, the transport activities which play an important role in the bilateral trade between EU and Turkey face important issues related to the movement of goods. For instance, in many cases there are quota limits on the number of transport permits that may be issued to Turkish trucks and lorries by an EU member state, with demand exceeding the number of permits available. Both sides recognize that this arrangement requires updating to resolve the deficiencies in order to increase the bilateral trade. It is estimated that liberalization of transportation could make a significant increase in bilateral trade volumes (Hakura, 2018).====As the EU is dependent on many imported products, to maintain its competitiveness and recover fully from the impact of the 2008 fiscal crisis, it has to reduce its protectionist measures. As is underlined by the World Bank (2014), the road transport quotas and transit permits negatively influence the free circulation of goods covered by the Customs Union. A 10% increase in trade restrictions could lead to a 4% loss in national income (European Commission, 2014). Greater cooperation is needed between the EU and Turkey for this purpose (Dawar & Togan, 2016). The Turkish authorities also agree that the road transport quota limits submitted by some European countries provide important barriers to an increase in the trade potential that could emerge if these limits were removed (Dawar & Togan, 2016). Such an approach should increase competition and lead to better allocation of resources in both Turkey and the EU, as well as other benefits for both partners. From the viewpoint of Turkey, quota barrier elimination or reduction will increase greater market access in the EU market.====This study is the final phase of a comprehensive research project. The aim of the project was to analyze the validity of the hypothesis that trade volume between Turkey and EU is negatively influenced by the transport quotas imposed on Turkey, which have been implemented by 24 of the 27 EU member states. In the first phase of the project, the effect of bilateral quotas on the total Turkish export by road transportation and on the total export of the Turkish textile sector was shown to be significant (Ülengin et al., 2015). In the second phase, in addition to bilateral quotas, transit quotas are considered. We show that both types of quotas have significant effects on the total Turkish export by road transportation (Çekyay et al., 2017). In the final phase that is presented in this paper, we develop a model to estimate the extra costs resulting from quotas and use these estimations to show that the bilateral and transport quotas have a significant negative effect on the total Turkish export (by all transport modes) to the selected countries. We also extend our analysis to the Turkish machinery and equipment sector (TMES), and the Turkish food and beverages sector (TFBS), both of which are shown to be negatively affected by the quotas as well. The main reason for choosing specifically these sectors is that the companies in these sectors heavily use road transportation. The percentage (in terms of US$) of exported goods by TMES and TFBS to the EU by using road transportation are 36% and 52% in 2015, respectively.====In order to calculate the extra costs owing to quotas, it is necessary to obtain the transportation cost and frequency of use for every used route between Turkey and the European countries. Although we can obtain the details of the routes and their corresponding costs, any reliable information about the yearly usage frequencies of the routes is not available (which is a common problem in the literature as indicated in Section 2.2). To estimate the approximate frequencies, we use an approach based on the multi-commodity flow model. This approximation approach estimates the usage of all possible routes under the assumption that all transport activities are governed by a central decision maker. As the transport companies act independently in real life, our approximation approach will provide only a lower bound for the real export loss due to quotas. Therefore, our results underestimate the actual situation.====All our previous papers on this subject (Çekyay et al., 2017; Ülengin et al., 2015) manage to show the negative effect of quotas either on Turkish total export by only road transportation or on the export of some specific sectors. In this study, we finally show that Turkish total export is negatively affected by the bilateral and transport quotas. This is mainly because this study incorporates actual transportation costs, which is made possible by using the approach based on the multi-commodity flow model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that combines the gravity model and the multi-commodity flow model for analyzing the effect of quotas on the international trade.====This paper is organized as follows. The second section provides a literature review on the application of gravity models in the analysis of international trade. The third section provides the general framework of the proposed model. In the fourth section, we estimate the increase in transportation costs due to quotas using a multi-commodity flow model. The fifth section analyzes the impact of extra cost due to quotas on Turkish export using gravity models. The sixth section aims to estimate the decrease in Turkish export to EU thorough scenario analyses. Finally, conclusions and further suggestions are presented.",A multi-commodity network flow and gravity model integration for analyzing impact of road transport quotas on international trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300056,21 January 2020,2020,Research Article,281.0

Empirically, the question is difficult to answer because policies that create new transit opportunities may involve a large number of ","According to the US Census Bureau, the typical worker spends 7% of their waking time commuting between work and home. Policies which impact the quality of transportation infrastructure should thus have large downstream consequences for society. However, the nature of these effects is difficult to ascertain because a single change in a transportation network can have multiple interacting effects. For example, the creation of a new road may reduce commute times, but may also lead to the creation of new businesses. The road may be funded by some combination of local, state, or federal sources, and money used for the road cannot be used for other public goods. The road might alter the community's social network dynamics as movement and communication patterns evolve. Indeed, transportation policies play an important role shaping social or political developments but precisely because their influence might be so large, they are difficult to study quantitatively.====In this study, we examine a unique transportation intervention which should have a concentrated effect on an important part of Americans’ financial life—property values. We then examine downstream effects of the intervention for electoral politics, which in some fundamental sense a conflict over property (especially in questions over taxation and the distribution of wealth (Dougherty, 2003; Fischel, 2004, p. 329; Marx, 2010; Mayhew, 1993)).

This increase in property values is correlated with a subsequent change in support for conservative candidates in presidential elections. Our analysis of a geographically-linked exit poll database allows us to make inferences about the mechanism behind this change. We find that, following the transportation-based shock to property values, voters placed greater emphasis on the importance of taxation.

With the purchase subsidy recently introduced by the Italian government, the cheapest BEVs become competitive also with respect to the diesel cars, but not relative to the petrol cars, unless more than 12,500 km are annually driven.","Battery Electric Vehicles==== (BEVs) are characterized by higher initial costs than Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs), i.e. petrol and diesel ones. Such a characteristic hinders BEVs uptake, since some consumers tend to underestimate long-term savings due to their lower operating costs (Allcott and Wozny, 2014; Krause et al., 2013). The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) concept, encompassing all present and future costs of a vehicle, is proposed as an alternative metric that a rational consumer should consider when deciding which vehicle to acquire.==== Since the pioneering work by Delucchi and Lipman (2001), an abundant literature has developed models and presented estimates comparing vehicles with different propulsion systems. It is, however, still open to debate whether, and under which conditions, BEVs are cost competitive. To be true, estimating the TCO metric is fraught with difficulties concerning the distinction between private and social costs, the uncertainty connected to the future stream of costs, the impact of the regulatory and fiscal policies, the inherently vehicle-, country- and individual-specific nature of the estimates.====This paper focuses on the latter issue (country- and individual-specific TCO estimates). Given the high heterogeneity among drivers in terms, among other things, of annual distance travelled, home charging availability and percentage of urban travel, this paper aims at dissecting the importance of these three cost determinants on the BEV TCO==== and, consequently, on BEV competitiveness. The annual distance travelled is a very important determinant of the BEV competitiveness since BEVs' variable costs are much lower that the ICEVs’ ones. The home charging availability, linked to the ownership of a parking space (in a private garage or multi-unit dwelling) entails the possibility of charging at night at cheaper hourly rates than those at public chargers. The percentage of trips made in urban traffic conditions (where BEVs outperform conventional cars in terms of fuel/energy efficiency====) implies lower operating costs. All these factors strengthen BEV competitiveness. Hence, drivers who enjoy such conditions are the ones who could benefit the most from buying a BEV. While the impact of the distance travelled is often studied in the literature via sensitivity analyses, the other two determinants, to the best of our knowledge, have been less researched (an exception being De Clerck et al. (2018) and Breetz and Salon (2018) for urban driving). Yet, we believe that they are very important in order to estimate the BEV potential market and to identify the proper marketing and public policies.====We develop a TCO model that makes explicit the role played by the specific characteristics of BEVs and perform the estimates for the Italian car market. We compare among 4 propulsion systems: BEV, HEV, petrol and diesel, and estimate the TCO for 36 best-selling car models belonging to the small to medium car segment. The selected models represent a large share of the total car sales. We use the break-even BEV manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) metric in order to identify by how much a BEV MSRP should be reduced (by the car manufacturers or by the policy maker via a purchase subsidy) in order to help BEVs penetrate the market. Finally, segmenting the Italian car drivers on the basis of the three abovementioned cost determinants, we estimate the share of Italian drivers who would find it cost convenient to buy a given electric car model in a scenario with or without purchase subsidies.====Our results are useful for a more detailed understanding of the determinants of the BEV TCO and of how they affect the overall BEV market potential. They can be of interest to car buyers, guiding their decision on which propulsion system to select for their car from a solely private monetary point of view. They can also be useful to car manufacturers to develop more focused BEVs’ marketing strategies, as well as to transport policy decision makers to tailor spatially and temporally their policies (e.g. purchase subsidies), targeting specific market segments without risking an excessive or insufficient use of public resources.","Dissecting the total cost of ownership of fully electric cars in Italy: The impact of annual distance travelled, home charging and urban driving",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919303208,16 January 2020,2020,Research Article,283.0

The delivery enterprise faced with incomplete information provides either high- or low-quality logistics services, while the e-firm regulates either actively or passively. Using an evolutionary game model, this paper seeks equilibrium strategies of the two parties under public supervision, with impacts of pertinent parameters on strategy selections illuminated. Analytical results indicate that the delivery firms rely mostly on comparative profit between high- and low-quality logistics services to make decisions, while the e-firms consult to monitoring cost rather than regulatory success rates to make selections between active and passive regulation. When public supervision stays at a relatively deficient level, passive supervision is preferred by the e-firm with the increase of consumer complaint rate. Still, it is possible to maintain the benefits of e-commerce corporations as well as enhance logistical performance in evolutionary games with the help of an operative supervision and punishment mechanism. Additional managerial insights are provided for discussion.","The advent and especially most recent sophistication of the Internet has facilitated substantial progress of electronic commerce (e-commerce). It is estimated that e-commerce sales keep a steady rise across the globe, increasing to $1.92 trillion in 2016, and will reach a climax to $4 trillion by 2020, accounting for a fraction of 14.6%, compared to that of 8.7% in 2015, of total retail sales (Emarketer, 2016). During 2017, the total online retail sales in China reached ¥ 7.10 trillion ($ 1.09 trillion), increased by 32.2% compared to that number during 2016 (ECRC, 2018). Though online business origins from and prevails in developed countries, developing Asian regions have witnessed phenomenal expansion of the industry over the past decades. China, India and Malaysia have burgeoned to an average growth of 20% in e-business. Among these, China has been the most influential e-market possessing the most massive volume of online sales since 2013, with Alibaba, a giant e-commerce corporation that occupies the largest market share of 26.6%, stimulates continuous prosperity of Internet business across the nation.====However, the situation is much more intricate than conventional statistics could indicate, there remains implications to be concerned. Since most e-commerce firms entrust third-party express delivery enterprises for supplementary of regular operations regarding physical distribution, logistical support has been proved consequential. While e-business has escalated unremittingly, the matching delivery service comes to a halt in better satisfying its clients and consumers (Chen, 2017). Worse still, credibility crisis arises in the trustee-beneficiary relationship between e-commerce and third-party express delivery enterprises. The logistics firm, driven by interests, may take advantage of information asymmetry to provide unqualified services for its own profit maximization, which brings about consumer complaints and makes the e-firm suffered. Thus, it is imperative for the e-firm to establish a well-run incentive and supervisory mechanism to maintain its benefits and invigorate logistical advancements.====In addition to a traditional monitoring mechanism between e-commerce enterprises and logistics service providers, public participation in the e-commerce environment is naturally considered as a third-party supervision. Owing to technology innovation and mass media advancement, e-commerce enterprises along with their logistics service providers are supervised by numerous online consumers with diverse requirements. Generally, the e-commerce enterprise autonomously regulates the logistics service provider with the help of the advanced e-commerce platform, where logistics operations could be tracked and evaluated. Besides, the advanced Internet has facilitated e-firms to accumulate feedbacks on logistics services from online buyers, in the form of consumer reviews and complaints. Once the logistics services provider is accused of performing inferiorly by consumers, the e-commerce enterprise then should take the responsibility to investigate such irregularities. According to “Chinese E-commerce User Experience and Complaint Report” published by China E-commerce Research Centre (CECRC), the year-over-year growth of complaint cases of inferior logistics in retail e-commerce accepted by the Public Service Platform of E-commerce Complaints and Rights Protection arrives to 30.78% (including commodity distribution, delivery, exchange or return) in the first half year of 2017. The proportions of 2016 and 2015 are 30.77% and 29.56%, respectively (CECRC, 2017). The stubbornly high reporting rate justifies enhanced public consciousness of safeguarding their rights and interests. From the perspective of online buyers, the express delivery enterprise conducting logistical business as expected is acclaimed for providing high-quality services conveying fast delivery, traceable and accurate information, good consumer reflection and so on. When the express delivery enterprise operates irregularly, however, even its tiny transgressions are to blame for inferior performances. Statistics show that unsatisfied logistical services regarding delivery delay, commodity damage, missing parcel or items, poor service attitude, etc., have occupied a fixed position among the ten hot spots of online shopping complaints since 2011 (CECRC, 2017).====Specific contribution of this paper is to show that within such contexts it is possible to maintain the benefits of e-commerce enterprises and to energize logistics industry in exchange for the delivery enterprises' irregularities, better satisfying online consumers and progress e-business eventually. To achieve such an objective, we modeled an evolutionary game between firms of e-commerce and express delivery considering public supervision and attained evolutionary stable strategies under various circumstances. In addition, associated numerical analyses are emerged to supplement theoretical exploration.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Following the introduction, a brief literature review provides insights into the issue of e-commerce operations and logistic performances. In Section 3, we set forth the basic model along with problem illustrations and assumptions. Proceeding to model formulation and discussion, Section 4 shows preferential strategies of both stakeholders under distinct conditions. The numerical analyses follow in Section 5, which manifest how relevant parameters impact evolutionary processes.

The model is calibrated to the Swedish city of Uppsala. A simple demand model is used. Sensitivity analyses suggest that this is sufficient for representing important welfare effects. The results indicate that there would be large, robust welfare gains from reducing public transport supply in Uppsala, especially in the outer zone of the city where reductions of supply would be large compared to the current situation. The welfare gains from adjusting fares would be smaller.","The development of urban passenger transport in Sweden faces a dilemma and public bus transport in small==== cities has a potentially important role in this context. On one side, there are policy objectives to; improve accessibility, reduce transport congestion, and reduce emissions. These policy objectives are perceived to require increased public transport (PT) capacity and has lead to a political goal in Sweden to double the number of passengers. On the other side, there is also a goal to have an economically efficient transport system, and Swedish operating costs have increased rapidly over the past decade (SKL, 2017), making these goals hard to combine. This dilemma is addressed by optimizing fares and frequency using the BUPOV==== model proposed here.====The general tendency in Swedish PT has been strong growth in both supply and demand (Nilsson, 2011; SKL, 2017). From 2005 to 2015 the total number of bus boardings in Sweden grew by 32 percent while the supply in kilometers grew by 22 percent (Trafikanalys, 2016). In small Swedish cities, supply increased by 20 percent and bus boardings by 23 percent from 2006 to 2011 (Pyddoke & Swärdh, 2017, p. 10), while costs increased by 44 percent. The increase in supply may be interpreted as a response to the goals presented above.====In the same period the analytical tools employed by regional public transport authorities (RPTAs) in Sweden did not develop much. Vigren and Ljungberg (2018) found that RPTAs do not use cost-benefit analysis to guide decisions about optimal levels of supply or pricing. That is, decisions regarding supply increases were not preceded by rigorous weighing of costs and benefits. This may possibly be because the available models were not relevant enough or were too costly to use. The then available Swedish transport models represented neither the link between public transportation usage and congestion nor crowding in vehicles. The BUPOV model aims to represent both these aspects with a small and fast model, allowing for optimization of frequencies and pricing. The model is thus able to illustrate central trade-offs between gains in travel time, comfortable occupancy, and less cost, but with less spatial resolution than current Swedish demand models.====The BUPOV model represents demand and is calibrated to variations between peak and off-peak hours in inner and outer parts of the city. Total welfare is optimized with respect to fares and frequencies in these periods and parts. As regards scope, we attempt to capture the major welfare effects of trips beginning or ending in Uppsala, but only the parts of those trips that are within the city boundaries. Thus possible non-internalized external effects arising outside Uppsala (e.g. congestion effects in Stockholm) resulting from trips beginning or ending in Uppsala are outside the scope of this study. Social preferences regarding redistribution between income groups are also outside the scope of the analysis.====From a welfare theoretical perspective, there are four important motives for using PT pricing and frequency as policy instruments. The first is if there are welfare gains accruing from shorter waiting times and less crowding in PT due to increased frequencies that have not been accounted for. The second is if street congestion and other externalities==== are reduced by increasing PT supply. The third is if there are additional benefits of increased accessibility for certain groups with few mode alternatives, for example, low-income earners or the disabled. The fourth is if the true alternative cost of public funds, either from tax collection or in the use of public funds, is under- or over-estimated.====The theoretical foundations of the literature on optimal pricing of PT can be found in Vickrey (1963) and Mohring (1972). Vickrey (1963) argued that it may be worthwhile to price peak hour trips higher than off-peak (OP) trips in a general transport context. The reason would be to prevent congestion or expensive investments in new capacity for peak use only, and to promote higher utilization during OP hours. Mohring (1972) found that more PT users means that supply can be expanded, leading to more benefits for all users, providing a basic rationale for PT subsidies.====Political actors are frequently reluctant to price externalities when doing so is perceived to harm strong interest groups. A solution has been to use alternative policy instruments that can reduce externalities without raising the cost to these interest groups. Subsidizing PT is thus seen as an alternative to pricing congestion. However, increasing PT supply without examining costs and benefits risks leading to an oversupply of PT.====Congestion problems in larger cities have been well studied in the literature, as has the optimal design of PT in larger cities, as illustrated in the references below. The main reason for this study is that neither the relative magnitude of market and policy failures, nor the optimal policies and their potentials are well known for smaller cities. This study therefore strives to calculate the costs and benefits of different levels of PT supply for the small Swedish city of Uppsala. These benefits and costs largely depend on the initial levels of supply, costs, prices, mode shares, congestion, crowding, and people's propensity to change from car transport, for all of which data are available. We explore the socially efficient potential of using PT pricing and frequency to capture the benefits of PT provision and reduce externalities associated with road use.====Several papers have presented models for optimizing congestion charges and PT fares and frequencies for large cities such as London and Brussels (Proost & van Dender, 2008); Washington DC, Los Angeles and London (Parry & Small, 2009); Paris (Kilani, Proost, & van der Loo, 2014); Sydney (Tirachini, Hensher, & Rose, 2014); London and Santiago de Chile (Basso & Silva, 2014); and Stockholm (Börjesson, Fung, & Proost, 2017). In some of these models, PT supply is also optimized, and in others optimal pricing of the car alternative is also considered. Consideration of distributional effects, emissions, and crowding also differs between studies. Insights from these studies include that there may be potential for differentiating PT fares and congestion charges between peak and OP hours and between geographical areas.====Previous studies have mainly focused on large cities with substantial congestion, but the role of congestion and crowding in smaller cities is less well known.==== The present study addresses this question, modeling optimal bus pricing and frequency throughout a small city, considering variability in occupancy and in walk/cycle alternatives, using detailed data on origin and destination incorporating modal choice==== and local external effects. These data are important, as the model baseline represents real occupancy rates by zone and time period. Like earlier studies, the present model simplifies by representing average conditions (e.g. occupancy and various components of the travel times).====Rather than adjusting frequency proportional to demand, as was done by Parry and Small (2009) and Kilani et al. (2014), we optimize for frequency. We show that this feature of the model is central to the analysis. In contrast to Basso, Guevara, Gschwender, and Fuster (2011, 2014) and Börjesson et al. (2017), who used a representative kilometer approach, we represent differences in demand and crowding along a representative line, meaning that our model focuses more directly on PT. From these perspectives the analysis is similar to that of Tirachini et al. (2014), who also have an entire PT line as study object. However, in their case, it is a specific line rather than a representative “mean” line of a city. A novelty in BUPOV is the use of a simple representation of the variation in demand along the representative line, for example, lower occupancy levels near the city periphery and higher occupancy levels at the city center. To this end, we develop a simple, general model of occupancy variation, needing only mean occupancy data for calibration, unlike the data-intensive approach of Tirachini et al. (2014). Compared to Tirachini et al. (2014) the fares, and more importantly, frequencies, are optimized by both time period and zone, and that the off-peak period is also analyzed. Optimization of frequency by zone has been analyzed earlier in e.g. Cortés, Jara-Díaz, and Tirachini (2011).====Some may question whether it is realistic to allow for such differentiation. However, the idea is to give a hint as to whether there is potential for spatial differentiation of supply. If so, possible means of doing so in practice include shortening or extending some lines, or introducing new, shorter lines. Such measures would imply additional transfers for some individuals (which we have not accounted for), and would require additional analyses on a more detailed route level.====Two important related aspects are the marginal costs of public funds (MCPF, i.e., the dead weight loss associated with collection of taxes) and the wider economic benefits (i.e., positive external effects of PT on the labor market). Although there is a strong case==== for adopting an MCPF >1, this has been done in fewer than half the cited studies. The wider economic benefits (WEBs) from PT, or lower travel costs in general, are more uncertain, but Eliasson and Fosgerau (2017) imply they may be important. None of the examined studies has considered such WEBs. However, in the present study we do this, both by using recent empirical estimates of aggregate WEBs from transport improvements in Sweden (about 12% in addition to directly calculated benefits==== (Anderstig, Berglund, & Börjesson, 2018)) and by subjecting this parameter to sensitivity analysis.====To summarize, the main contribution of our model compared to the previous literature is that it gives a simpler representation of the trade-offs between several important benefits and costs using data representing all modes in a small city, in particular the variation in demand along the representative line. In addition, we believe that the adopted top down approach, i.e. of representing a public transport on an aggregate system level rather than detailed route level is more tailored toward data availablitity in general. In Sweden, route level modeling is partly hindered by the fact that, accounting data on route level is not available. We perform extensive sensitivity analysis with respect to key model simplifications and parameters. The empirical contribution is to model a small city using high resolution data. Table 1 summarizes the literature and the contributions of the present study.====The main finding of this paper is that large welfare increases can be achieved by reducing frequencies, and more so in the outer than the inner zone. Since the earlier studies referred to above (with the exeption of studies directly aimed at analysing demand varying in geography) have not explicitly examined less densely populated parts of cities, this represents an extension. This result is robust to all ten sensitivity analyses performed, regarding both key model simplifications and parameter values. Lower frequencies reduce both operating costs and road congestion; in addition, lower fares contribute, but considerably less, to increasing welfare. Put differently, bus crowding in Uppsala does not currently justify general increases in fares or frequencies. The previous literature on optimal supply has had diverging conclusions; in some studies the frequencies have been found to be too low, and in some too high (see Discussion section).====An additional important finding is that large welfare gains can be achieved from optimization compared with today's situation, despite using a very simple representation of the demand system, as the welfare gains are robust, for example, to the cross-mode demand assumptions.==== This result implies that there may be a large potential for adopting optimization of PT frequencies in small cities, where 13% of the OECD population lives (OECD, 2019).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We analyze passengers who share ","Since the beginning of the 1990s, the European Commission has been attempting to foster competition in the railway sector, in order to raise efficiency and to improve the intermodal competitiveness of rail as the most environmentally friendly traffic mode. Accordingly, rail freight transport and international passenger rail services are now open to competition. Opening national passenger rail services to competition as well, as announced in the Fourth Railway Package, will complete the liberalization process. The European Commission thereby aims at competition for the market by means of franchising for non-profitable (usually short-distance) services and open access with competition in the market, also called on-track competition, for commercial (usually long-distance) services (Perennes, 2017).====In some European countries, open access for long-distance passenger rail services already exists (Beria & Grimaldi, 2017). Nevertheless, on-track competition is non-marginal in just a few of them (i.e. Italy, Austria, Czech Republic and Sweden). At this point, one could compare the regulatory frameworks in the respective countries to determine whether open access alone can foster sufficient on-track competition. Many authors==== have their doubts.====We, however, would rather pose the question of whether in this market segment, on-track competition is really desirable in all circumstances. In this paper, we analyze the welfare effect of on-track competition, when connecting trains may be missed due to delays, and tickets are operator-tied. We show that, depending on the probability of missed connections, on-track competition can be welfare-reducing. We offer a formal model supporting the proposition formulated by Nash and Preston (1992, p. 10): “successful entry which did not totally displace the incumbent operator would lead to [a] loss of economies of density, and may also disbenefit passengers”. This is arguably “the most potent argument for the singular provision of train services” (Starkie, 1993, p. 53).====The German railway network and the transport services offered have some unique features that justify the assumptions of our model. In contrast to France or Spain (Zembri & Libourel, 2017), for example, many cities (and stations) are scattered throughout the country and there is no central city that serves as the hub or main destination. Furthermore, the supply of fast trains, most of which do not confirm to the high-speed definition of 250 km/h, but are fast enough to compete with car and air travel up to distances of 800 km, is relatively dense. As a result, many passengers have to change long-distance trains at one station or more.====In a network with scarce capacity, delay is easily transmitted to subsequent trains and often cannot be absorbed by spare tracks. Gibson, Cooper, and Ball (2002) present evidence that delay increases exponentially if the network approaches full capacity. In Germany, only some tracks are used exclusively for High Speed Rail (HSR). Most tracks are used simultaneously by slower trains, which intensifies the problem of scarce capacity and delays. Thus, long-distance trains follow a timetable, but are not always able to be on time,==== so that connecting trains may be missed,==== and passengers have to make new plans. Since no seat reservation is required and tickets are valid on the next train (even those of a higher type like ICE), they do not buy a new ticket but merely get onto the next available train.====Currently, almost all long-distance passenger rail services are offered by Deutsche Bahn Fernverkehr, the still state-owned train operating company (TOC). If there were on-track competition, the next available train could be operated by a competing TOC. Since tickets are usually only valid on trains of the issuing TOC, passengers missing a connecting train then could not merely use the next available train (or they would have to be willing to buy new tickets), but would have to wait for the next train of the TOC they chose at the beginning of their journey. This also applies, for example, for cross-border traveling passengers with through tickets==== having to change trains at the border. If on both sides of the border national on-track competition existed, the TOC operating the next train out in cases of a missed connection, would not necessarily be part of the initial transport contract. Thus, passengers would suffer from a reduced “effective frequency” (Nash, Nilsson, & Link, 2013, p. 192) and thus higher schedule delay costs.====In order to analyze this aspect of on-track competition from the perspective of welfare economics, in our model of a duopoly market for long-distance passenger rail services, we assume that the combined schedule of individual TOCs yields an interlaced structure of departure times, i.e. a departure of one TOC is followed by a departure of the other one. This is the equilibrium outcome in the van Reeven (2006) horizontal product differentiation model with two dimensions (i.e. departure time and service quality). For the sake of simplicity, we abstain from service quality differentiation. In this case, unregulated timetable competition results in unstable service patterns, because of the lack of a pure strategy equilibrium (van Reeven & Janssen, 2006). However, van der Weijde, Verhoef, and van den Berg (2014) show in a Hotelling model with price-sensitive demand and asymmetric distance costs, departure times are scheduled closer together than optimal and should be of interest to regulators. Our assumption of interlacing, equidistant departure times is the welfare-maximizing regulation (Broman & Eliasson, 2017).====Furthermore, on-track competition may result in higher or lower frequencies of TOCs and therefore may or may not reduce passengers’ schedule delay costs. We assume overall frequency to be the same as in the monopoly by symmetrically allocating the tracks to both TOCs in the duopoly.==== The constant overall frequency assumption is reasonable, if tracks are operating at full capacity. So is the symmetry assumption, since comparable supply is considered to be a long-term sustainable form of on-track competition (Beria & Grimaldi, 2017). This is especially true, if TOCs offer connecting trains and passengers anticipate the problem of missed connections. Apart from departure times, frequency and service quality, TOCs can compete on fares, speed, stops and other characteristics (Tomeš, Kvizda, Jandová, & Rederer, 2016). For simplicity, we concentrate on fares only.====According to Johnson and Nash (2012), on-track competition, on the one hand, entails a loss of economies of density, which leads to higher costs for the competing TOCs. On the other hand, competitive pressure makes them work more efficiently. Because the overall effect on cost is ambiguous (Friebel, Ivaldi, & Vibes, 2010) we assume that the TOCs’ costs remain unchanged, compared to the monopoly case. Among others, Johnson and Nash (2012) further stress that on-track competition has to increase demand in order to be welfare-enhancing. To allow for the possibility of an increased demand for train travel, we assume this demand to be elastic. Thus, passengers anticipating the possibility of missed connections, demand significantly more train tickets if on-track competition lowers the full price of traveling by train, which consists of the fare and schedule delay costs.====Our paper is related to the literature on on-track competition and its effect on overall welfare. Preston, Whelan, and Wardman (1999) analyze several scenarios of duopolistic on-track competition, for example, including product differentiation. They present simulation results for the games they consider and conclude that on-track competition usually cannot benefit passengers more than it harms producers, and therefore reduces overall welfare. Although Preston et al. (1999) recommend introducing interchangeable tickets, they do not consider connecting trains that may be missed, in the context of which non-interchangeable tickets are more of a problem.====Alvarez-SanJaime, Cantos-Sanchez, Moner-Colonques, and Sempere-Monerris (2015) analyze on-track competition between two TOCs on a HSR line and a competing air transport service operator with private and/or public operators and endogenous service frequency. Private operators are assumed to maximize profits, whereas a public operator maximizes social welfare subject to a break-even constraint. Simulation results show that the entry of a private TOC increases welfare only if it entails very large increases in rail-traffic demand. Alvarez-SanJaime et al. (2015) stress that such welfare gains are substantially larger if the incumbent TOC is not privatized, but remains public. Alvarez-SanJaime, Cantos-Sanchez, Moner-Colonques, and Sempere-Monerris (2016) focus on the vertical structure and endogenous access charges when analyzing the introduction of competition on HSR lines. They find that on-track competition generates larger welfare gains if infrastructure and rail operations are vertically integrated and if there is marginal access pricing. And again, if market entry does not generate enough demand, it can not be welfare-enhancing at all.====Broman and Eliasson (2017) study a duopoly market for passenger rail services and thereby assume that price competition occurs between trains with close departure times. They show that welfare increases when moving from a profit-maximizing monopoly to competition, if regulation can prevent TOCs from purchasing the respective competitor's access rights and restoring monopoly this way. If then TOCs offer equally many departures, and a departure of one TOC is always followed by a departure of the other, welfare is maximized. Thus, the number and allocation of slots is of great importance.====Cherbonnier, Ivaldi, Muller-Vibes, & van der Straeten, 2018 pose the question of whether competition should be introduced to the market for long-distance passenger rail services rather by means of franchising than by an open access mechanism. Therefore, they compare the outcomes of competition for the market and on-track competition, by simulating for two relations in France, a differentiated-products oligopoly model allowing for inter- and intra-modal competition. The results show that the effect of on-track competition is uncertain, since it is not clear that competition can cause downward pressure on fares similar to the tariff distortions in the monopoly case (e.g. in the form of price-regulation or a deterrence strategy of the monopolist). But it is possible to maintain such tariff distortions and generate efficiency gains as well, when introducing competition for the market. This speaks in favor of organizing competition by means of franchising.====Although most of the above-mentioned articles challenge the proposition that on-track competition, from the perspective of welfare economics, is always desirable, none of these authors considers operator-tied ticketing in connection with delays and missed connections, as we do.",The impact of delays on the welfare effects of on-track competition: The case of transfer passengers with operator-tied tickets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919303233,23 December 2019,2019,Research Article,287.0

The Receiver-led delivery consolidation (RLC) policy has the potential to significantly reduce the number of deliveries to receivers. However, empirical evidence shows wide variance in their success, possibly driven by the relative willingness of receivers to accept RLC policy. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine and model receivers' willingness to participate in the RLC service. Using a stated-preference survey, behavioural responses were collected from businesses in 13 sub-industries based in Melbourne's CBD, Australia. The businesses' preferences were estimated using an ordered logit model to identify the characteristics that could drive willingness to participate. The modelling results illustrate that the receivers' willingness to participate in the RLC service is significantly influenced by the intensity of their delivery activities and the sub-industry. Furthermore, the policy implications are discussed to facilitate setting suitable and relevant RLC policy variables for the most willing receivers.","Trends such as the desire for speed in delivery lead time, rise of the sharing economy and omni-channel fulfilment have contributed to significant changes in last mile deliveries (Savelsbergh & Van Woensel, 2016). These trends are increasing the frequency and number of express and urgent deliveries as well as fragmentation of shipments (Aljohani & Thompson, 2016). Consequently, the increasing number of freight vehicle movements in the inner-city area contribute to air pollution, noise, congestion, increasing logistics costs and exacerbated road safety (Browne, Allen, Nemoto, Patier, & Visser, 2012). Local authorities have trialled and implemented various initiatives and solutions to address the negative impacts of last mile delivery with various degrees of success and failure. Aljohani and Thompson (2018, pp. 24) highlight that many of these solutions have concentrated primarily on carrier-focused initiatives such an urban consolidation centres (UCC), freight vehicles’ restriction schemes and environmentally-friendly vehicles. The UCC provides freight carriers with a logistics facility usually located in suburban parts of the city to consolidate the deliveries to their receivers (Browne, Sweet, Woodburn, & Allen, 2005). The goods are bundled, and consolidated shipments are carried out using neutral trucks in subsequent deliveries to receivers inside the urban area. The UCC concept attempts to increase the load utilisation of delivery vehicles, minimise the total travelled distance per parcel and offer additional services to receivers (Allen at al. 2014).====Lagorio, Pinto, and Golini (2016) observed that majority of previous freight consolidation projects in Europe focused primarily on freight carriers in the planning and decision-making to initiate and coordinate the effort to consolidate the deliveries to goods receivers. However, Holguín-Veras et al. (2015) suggest that instead of focusing only on freight carriers to enhance last mile delivery, Freight Demand Management (FDM) policies should be considered due to the power that receivers can exert on delivery requirements. These policies attempt to encourage behavioural changes in the freight demand patterns of receivers. Specifically, the Receiver-led delivery consolidation (RLC) policy, which is one of the FDM solutions, promotes two different initiatives to consolidate deliveries to receivers in order to reduce the number of their deliveries (Holguín-Veras, Sánchez-Díaz, & Browne, 2016). The first initiative attempts to induce receivers to request their suppliers and freight carriers to transfer the parcels to an intermediate consolidation facility where their orders are bundled and delivered in consolidated and optimised loads to their premises (Holguín-Veras & Sánchez-Díaz, 2016). This initiative requires setting up a physical facility to receive, sort and perform the consolidated deliveries and builds on the receivers’ market powers. Alternatively, the second initiative focuses on large commercial establishments and buildings to understand their freight needs and formulate a delivery service plan (DSP) to efficiently coordinate and manage the deliveries to the receivers inside the establishment or building (Jaller, Wang, & Holguin-Veras, 2015; Transport for London, 2013). This initiative does not require substantial infrastructural changes to the delivery destinations and practise to the receivers.====Marcucci and Gatta (2017) emphasise that in order for freight improvement policies to be successful and fostering the required behavioural changes, the insights and preferences of the main stakeholders especially the receivers should be taken into consideration. Similarly, dell’Olio, Moura, Ibeas, Cordera, and Holguin-Veras (2017) argue that more freight behavioural research is required to appraise the responses of receivers as many previous urban freight policies were implemented without solid understanding of the interactions and power levels within the local freight industry. Alternatively, Marcucci, Gatta, and Le Pira (2018) call for the use of game dynamics or gamification approach, i.e. the use of gameplay elements in non-game settings, as a promising tool to account for the actors' heterogeneous preferences in order to promote behavioural change in stakeholders and enhance users' engagement in freight improvement solutions. Various studies using stated preference (SP) surveys have been conducted to evaluate the responses of receivers towards urban freight policies especially FDM policies. However, Holguín Veras and Sánchez-Díaz (2016) indicate that the majority of previous FDM studies have paid more attention to off-hour delivery (OHD) than other policies. It can be argued that much uncertainty still exists about the behavioural preferences of receivers towards other FDM policies and especially the RLC policy. The interest of receivers in the RLC service is not fully understood and little is known about the factors that may influence their participation. This limited knowledge calls for more behavioural freight research to evaluate the RLC policy.====This study aims to investigate the receivers' willingness to participate in the RLC service by appraising the perceptions and stated responses of businesses in the inner-city area to request their shippers and freight carriers to transfer the parcels to a proposed freight consolidation facility for a subsequent consolidated delivery to their premises. The study seeks to estimate the influence of receivers’ business characteristics on their preferences in inducing changes in the frequency and practices of their current deliveries to promote consolidating their deliveries. Accordingly, behavioural responses were collected using a stated-preference survey from retailers and businesses from various sub-industries in Melbourne CBD, Australia. The responses were used to estimate an ordered logit model with respect to their willingness to participate in proposed freight consolidation schemes and determine the delivery characteristics of receivers who are most willing to participate. This will enable identifying which receivers from various industry sectors might be interested in participating in the RLC service and determining which delivery characteristics to focus on in order to spur the receivers to influence shippers and freight carriers to consolidate their deliveries. The derived insights from the estimation of the delivery characteristics provide valuable insights into the size of the receivers that might be useful in formulating suitable and effective RLC policy that is tailored for the most willing receivers.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of receiver-focused freight behavioural research and freight improvement policies. Section 3 describes the design of the SP survey. Section 4 presents the descriptive analysis of the results collected from receivers. Section 5 presents the results of the behavioural model and stated responses of receivers.

The forces driving the rapid growth of air transport and the role it has played in promoting tourism, trade and economic development are well-documented (Dwyer and Forsyth, 2007; Graham, Papatheodorou and Forsyth, 2008; IATA, 2014; Oxford Economic Forecasting, 2003). Changes to air transport policy, as well as air transport infrastructure constraints, have important implications for tourism planning, development and management (Abeyratne, 1993; Crouch, 1992; Debbage, 2002; Duval, 2013; Forsyth, 2006; Mayor & Tol, 2010; Njoya, Christidis, & Nikitas, 2018; Seetaram, Song, & Page, 2014). Previous studies have established a clear bi-directional relationship between air transport and tourism. For example, it has been shown that aviation taxation is detrimental to the development of tourism (Forsyth, Niemeier, & Njoya, 2015; Ikiara & Nyangito, 2001; Mayor & Tol, 2010; Seetaram et al., 2014; Tol, 2007), while the tourism infrastructure has contributed to the development of air traffic and low-cost carriers in Europe (Bieger & Wittmer, 2006). Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, Forsyth et al. (2015) estimate the potential effects on tourism and the economy of an increase in Australia's Passenger Movement Charge rate in the inbound, outbound and domestic markets, concluding that although these markets would experience a contraction in outputs, the Australian economy would gain, with most of the total positive economic effects accruing to non-tourism industries. The authors argue that tourism-related industries may gain or lose from an aviation tax, depending on the price elasticity of demand for inbound and outbound travel, substitution between domestic and outbound tourism, and the balance of inbound and outbound tourism.====Forsyth et al.’s (2015) study clearly illustrates that in evaluating the impact of air transport policy, it is essential to take a wider-economy approach by examining the effects on other sectors and the economy as a whole. CGE models have emerged in recent years as the most comprehensive tools to capture the economy-wide impacts of air transport policy and investments (Forsyth et al., 2015). Unlike partial equilibrium models of individual sectors, CGE models account for inter-industry and inter-institutional linkages and simulate the net benefits of a policy or project proposal.====Travel and tourism play a vital role in the Egyptian economy, generating employment and contributing to national income. The sector's total contribution (including indirect and induced impacts) was 8.5% to employment and 11.0% to GDP in 2017 (WTTC, 2018). According to IATA (2017), air transport contributes significantly to the Egyptian economy in terms of job creation, tax revenues, GDP and tourism development. In 2014, air transport and foreign tourists arriving by air accounted for 4.4% of the country's GDP. Recognising the benefits of air connectivity, in recent years Egypt has taken steps to improve air access to the country, including air transport liberalisation and infrastructure development (O'Connell & Warnock-Smith, 2012; Schlumberger & Weisskopf, 2012). Despite these developments, barriers to trade in the air transport sector remain relatively high. According to Export.gov (n.d.), the bilateral aviation safety agreement (BASA) concluded between Egypt and the United States in 1964 remains restrictive, with limited agreement on cooperative marketing arrangements that provide for charter services. Private and foreign air carriers require approval from the national carrier, EgyptAir, to operate charter flights to and from Cairo. Using partial equilibrium techniques, previous studies have shown that air transport liberalisation in Egypt would result in lower fares (Omar & Sekkat, 2012), and full liberalisation would be likely to result in a substantial increase in tourist arrivals, jobs and GDP (WTTC, 2005).====Unlike previous studies, this paper develops a comparative static CGE model of Egypt that can capture the economy-wide impact of Egyptian service sector reforms. This model is then used to simulate the impacts on tourism and the wider economy of price-reducing reforms to air transport services in Egypt. Reductions in the price of air transport may be brought about by air transport liberalisation, improvements to airport infrastructure, tax reductions or subsidies. For instance, Micco and Serebrisky (2004) show that improving airport infrastructure in the United States from the 25th to 75th percentiles reduces air transport costs by 15%. A similar improvement in the quality of regulation reduces air transport costs by 14%, and open skies agreements further reduce these costs by 8%.====In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 provides an overview of aeropolitics in Egypt, Section 3 documents the data and methodology used to calibrate the model, Section 4 explains the design of the simulations, and Section 5 presents the findings and interprets the results of the study.

The findings confirmed the diversity of the sector and indicated the presence of more business models. Our findings also call for the development of sector specific research tools and methodologies aimed at business models in business aviation to comprehensively answer the question how the sector works.","The term “business aviation” covers a broad scope of aviation activities and there are several definitions of the term which confirm that ==== (IAPBA, 2018). The definition of the FAA (2019) emphasizes that ==== According to EUROCONTROL (2017), business aviation is “==== what reflects miscellaneous operations performed within the business aviation sector. Similarly, this diversity of operations within business aviation is contained in the International Business Aviation Council's definition which deems business aviation as ==== (ICAO, 2018). According to IAPBA (2018) the position of business aviation is ====.====One might build several cases in order to demonstrate the difficulties in separating business aviation from general aviation.==== For example, two individuals might hire an aircraft in order to fly from A to B, one of them headed for a business meeting, the other one visiting his family. Also, in the case of fractional ownership models, companies and private individuals might jointly own an aircraft, using it for different purposes. Similarly, a business aviation company may offer sightseeing flights within its product portfolio which might be considered a typical ‘on demand’ service. However, the motivation of the customer for purchasing this service does not have to be business related. To separate business aviation from commercial air transportation, the easiest – although not very precise – way is to consider aircraft types. Furthermore, business aviation is often thought of as the segment of aviation which delivers specific air services which are not open to the public, and which are designated for time-sensitive as well as comfort-sensitive customers with a high willingness to pay. Individual customisation of air services is a further feature typical for the product of business aviation companies.====In the long-term, business aviation is a major contributor to the growth of aviation, especially with respect to air transport movements. As Budd and Graham (2009) noted, the liberalisation of air transport markets had contributed to the expansion of business aviation because business aviation copes successfully with several negative phenomena of liberalisation, mainly delays of flights as well as insufficient comfort and on-board services. The market share and the dynamics of business aviation are remarkable. According to EUROCONTROL (2017), business and general aviation is the third largest segment in Europe with a market share about 7% of all flights over the previous ten years. According to GAMA (2016), two-third of 24 million general aviation flight hours were performed for business purposes in the US in 2015. In China, the general aircraft population is expected to reach 20,000 by 2023 (AVIC, 2018), although, as Zhu et al. (2017) noted, in comparison to the US China's general aviation just started. Globally, between 2017 and 2018, the world business aircraft fleet grew by 1.4%, from 37,284 units to 37,792; this includes 22,273 jets and 15,519 turboprop-powered aircraft (Fleet Report 2018: The state of the industry, 2019). Despite the above-mentioned facts, the research on business models in business aviation is rather narrow if we compare it with numerous papers focusing on the business models of traditional, low cost, regional, holiday and cargo airlines.====This paper contributes to the research on business models in business aviation by presenting the results of an empirical analysis focusing on air charter companies. After the literature review, we outline the methodology of our research as well as the approach to data gathering. In order to analyse business models, we combine the Canvas concept with cluster analysis. As a result, we identified three clusters of air charter operators which belong to the sector of business aviation, representing the so called commercial for hire operations. Although our survey only covered air charter operators (74 firms from five world regions), the results suggest that future research on business models in business aviation will need to develop sector specific research tools and methodologies which would better reflect the diversity of business aviation.

One of the key economic benefits of air transport is consumer surplus (CS) of passengers which can be broadly defined as the benefit which a consumer enjoys in excess of the perceived costs of travel (DfT 2017). The benefit is generally recorded as the individual reservation price, i.e. the consumer's willingness to pay. Travel costs include the paid airfare as monetary expense but may also consider components related to the quality of air services such as time costs (Burghouwt, 2016). In the following, we do not account for the fact that especially for business travel the passenger is not necessarily the payer of the ticket. As the present paper calculates aggregated CS for nonstop (direct) services on a route-level only, we apply a narrow definition of CS as the difference between the consumer's willingness to pay and the paid airfare. In theory, CS is a convincing monetary measure of welfare that passengers gain from air travel. This paper extends research by (i) presenting a practicable method to implement CS as a means to analyze the welfare impact of air transportation and by (ii) estimating CS for selected routes to and from Germany. To this end, we calculate CS using price elasticity estimates for aggregated air travel demand together with origin-destination (OD) passenger volumes and fare levels to derive air travel demand functions.====For travel demand modeling numerous theories and approaches exist (Winkler, 2015). In comparison to the use of gravity models (Grosche, Rothlauf, & Heinzl, 2007; Zhang, Lin, & Zhan, 2018) or discrete choice modeling (Coldren, Koppelman, Kasturirangan, & Mukherjee, 2003; Lurkin, Garrow, Higgins, Newman, & Schyns, 2018; Train, 2009), we build on the methodology proposed by Braun, Klophaus, and Lueg-Arndt (2010) which has already influenced several studies made afterwards (e.g. Oxford Economics, 2011). This approach is rather straightforward as it only requires three pieces of information (price elasticities, passenger volumes, and airfares) to obtain air travel demand functions. Prud'homme and Bocarejo (2005) calculate the equation of a linear demand function with equilibrium points in two consecutive years using pre-charge and post-charge data referring to road congestion charging in Central London, while we use the equilibrium point of a demand curve together with the price elasticity of the corresponding air transport market. The demand functions derived with our approach allow us to estimate CS of airline passengers. More specifically, by using directional segment-specific market data on the number of round-trips, average fare levels and aggregated own-price elasticities, we calculate CS associated with OD traffic between Frankfurt (FRA) and Hong Kong (HKG), Shanghai (PVG), San Francisco (SFO) and Los Angeles (LAX) in both directions. We analyze passenger volumes and fare levels for nonstop (direct) services only and, hence, do not consider connecting (indirect) services for a given OD. Our analysis remains on a route-level and does neither distinguish between carriers (e.g. between Cathay Pacific (CX) and Lufthansa (LH) on the FRA-HKG route) nor specific flights on a given route. While the present paper looks at selected routes only, our approach can also be used for other routes.====Many studies on the economic impact of air transport have been commissioned by airport authorities, industry associations or governmental institutions. A comprehensive synthesis of airport economic impact methods and models is provided by Transportation Research Board (2008). Besides studies on the employment and income effects of producing air transport services along the value chain applying the input-output analysis (e.g. Lee & Yoo, 2016), the causal relationship between air transport and economic growth has been examined by several researchers (e.g. Allroggen & Malina, 2014; Hakim & Merkert, 2016). There is also welfare analysis for other modes of transportation such as passenger rail (e.g. Preston & Robins, 2013). Investments in aviation infrastructure and also aviation policy measures such as deregulation and environmental measures can be evaluated through Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). Within a CBA framework, an important part usually consists of CS (DfT 2017).====There are various empirical studies on price elasticities of air transport demand (Seetaram, 2010). Frequently quoted surveys of price elasticity estimates for air travel demand are Oum, Waters, and Yong (1992) who also discuss different forms of demand functions and Gillen, Morrison, and Stewart (2002). Both meta-studies and other existing research are reviewed by Intervistas (2007). Intervistas combines a review of the existing literature with own empirical work that highlights the bearings of factors such as degree of aggregation or time horizon on price elasticity estimates. While price elasticity estimates of air travel demand are important for industry players and policy makers, to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive study similar to the one of Gillen et al. has been published in the recent past. Hence, it is not clear how market dynamics such as an increased price transparency for consumers have influenced elasticity values. Most studies estimate air travel demand elasticities at a high level of data aggregation such as the market-level. Mumbower, Garrow, and Higgins (2014) show how flight-level price elasticities can be estimated with publicly-available online data. More recently, Cohen, Hahn, Hall, Levitt, and Metcalfe (2016) consider the case of Uber to estimate elasticities at several points along the demand curve using almost 50 million individual-level observations.====The next section of this paper describes the methods of data analysis. Section 3 provides route-level demand functions and Section 4 estimates revenues and CS for directional OD traffic on selected routes between Germany and Asia or North America, respectively.

The European Union allows these subsidies to passengers living in European outermost regions and other specific regions. This paper analyses the effects of this kind of subsidies on the ticket price and level of competition. If there is no competition in the market, the ==== airline increases the ticket price to capture part of residents’ subsidy and, thus, non-residents will be worse off. However, when the regulator raises the amount of the subsidy, there may be an unexpected effect on competition: a potential entrant may find the entry profitable, spurring competition and air connectivity. With competition, the non-desirable effects of granting a subsidy only for residents are mitigated. However, this latter case is only possible if the proportion of resident passengers in the route is high enough.","Passengers living in remote areas may be entitled to receive air transport subsidies in order to ensure they are able to travel and be connected with main destinations. This type of public intervention is usually an exemption to the general rule that forbids the granting of state aids in air transport liberalized markets. In Europe the exemption applies to passengers living in the outermost regions of Canary Islands (Spain); Madeira and the Azores (Portugal); and Martinique, Réunion, French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin (France). Passenger subsidies may adopt either the form of a specific subsidy (fixed amount irrespective of the fare level), or an ==== one (percentage of discount on the ticket price), with different administrative procedures accompanying the measure (see Valido, Socorro, Hernández, & Betancor, 2014, or; Fageda, Suárez-Alemán, Serebrisky, & Fioravanti, 2018).====In Spain an ==== subsidy applies to passengers living in the archipelagos of the Canary and Balearic Islands, as well as passengers living in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla.==== Only domestic routes connecting these areas with other destinations in Spain are affected. Currently the percentage of the discount reaches a 75%, though such a percentage has been evolving along time, with the initial establishment of a 10% discount (in application from 1987 to 1998), and subsequent increases to 33% (in application from 1998 to 2004), to 38% (in application from February to December 2005), to 45% (in application in 2006), to 50% (in application from 2007 to 2017 in interisland routes and 2018 in other domestic routes) and, finally, to the current 75% (Valido et al., 2014).====In this paper we develop a theoretical model that analyses the effects of the introduction (and subsequent increase) of a subsidy for resident passengers in the ticket price, market quantity and level of competition. We also analyze the effects on residents' and non-residents’ surplus, airlines’ profits and government expenditure. This distinction between winners and losers becomes fundamental to evaluate whether the subsidy for residents allows to achieve the desired effects.====When the amount of the subsidy is increased, potential entrants may find profitable to enter the market, spurring competition and air connectivity. We use this model to explain the case of the Canary Islands, subject to public service obligation (PSO) regulation and discounts for residents, and the entry of Air Europa Express in the interisland air transport market, just after the last increase in the percentage of discount for resident passengers from 50% to 75%.====The literature on market entry and barriers is well established in the field of Industrial Organization (see Bain, 1956; Sylos-Labini, 1962; Modigliani, 1958; Spence, 1977, Dixit, 1979 and 1980; Milgrom & Roberts, 1982 and Gilbert, 1987, among many others). In relation to the analysis of the specific issue on entry on air transport markets, there is also a wide body of literature available starting with the seminal papers by Bailey and Panzar (1981) and Bailey and Baumol (1984). On the other hand, other works in the literature have empirically examined the impact of air transport subsidies on ticket prices (Calzada & Fageda, 2012; Fageda, Jiménez, & Díaz, 2012, or; Fageda, Jiménez, & Valido, 2016) as well as the convenience of the subsidy type (Socorro, Betancor, & Myon, 2020; Valido et al., 2014). There is also a branch in the air transport literature that concentrates on the functioning and impact of PSOs (see Reynolds-Feighan, 1995; Williams & Pagliari, 2004; Santana, 2009; Di Franceso & Pagliari, 2012; Pita, Antunes, Barnhart, & Gomez de Menezes, 2013, Merkert & O'Fee, 2013; and Calzada & Fageda, 2014, among others). To our knowledge no previous works have examined the likely effects on competition of changes in air transport ==== subsides aimed for resident passengers.====In this paper we argue that, in routes with no competition, an ==== subsidy only for residents may have no effects on the total market quantity and, thus, it may not be a good policy to promote air connectivity in remote regions. The reason is that the monopoly airline increases the ticket price to capture part of the subsidy so, though resident passengers demand more with the subsidy, non-resident passengers demand less. The only way to increase the market quantity is to increase the amount of the subsidy to make other airlines’ entry profitable which promotes competition in the market. This latter case is only possible if the proportion of resident passengers on the route is high enough.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the case of air transport policies in the Canary Islands. In section 3 we develop the theoretical model that explains under which circumstances the introduction of an ==== subsidy only for residents promotes competition in the market, which increases the total market quantity in the route and, thus, air connectivity. Section 4 contains a numerical example that illustrates the main results of the theoretical model. Finally, section 5 summarizes the main conclusions.",Air transport subsidies for resident passengers: The unexpected effects on competition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302847,25 November 2019,2019,Research Article,292.0

The structure of noise charges at airports may thus include elements of symbolism and in many cases will fail to provide incentives for the use of less noisy aircraft. For this, we estimate a nested logit model for aircraft use for the case of Zurich Airport. Our findings show, that the probability for using a certain aircraft type does not change with the noise surcharge. This suggests that reasons for the existence of such charging schemes may only be found in the field of the political economy.","With rising environmental concerns about airport noise, the effectiveness of regulatory measures becomes a central policy issue. In order to reduce airport noise annoyance to its optimal level, policy makers have several options, including pricing policies as well as command and control measures. In this paper, we focus particularly on the potential of economic incentives and examine the effectiveness of airport charges that are differentiated according to the noise emissions of the aircraft.====Von Weizsäcker mentions already in 1982 (p. 342) that environmental policy involves political compromises.==== In this paper, we keep this insight and consider environmental protection to be a political compromise. We test this hypothesis empirically for the case of differentiated noise related airport charges. Therefore, this paper follows the economic paradigm initiated by Laffont's (2000) seminal work. Laffont's contribution resulted in the notion that different tariff structures may cause different welfare losses due to political distortions. Taking these into account the overall welfare performance of certain tariff structures may invert. A two-part tariff for instance may no longer be superior to a smith-tariff, if one takes into account the corresponding political distortions. Political economic considerations should therefore consider not only ==== but also ====. However, Laffont's world consists of two groups, who alternate in power with a certain probability. In this modeling framework compromises are not possible, that is, the political power of participating actors is clearly defined and “the winner takes it all”. That means, the resulting price structure will reflect the balance of the political power only for the case in which a certain group prevails in the political process. Such situations are, however, not that realistic. Much more realistic are situations in which more groups interfere in the political process and the relative political power to each other may determine the final implemented price structure (Lafont & Tirole 2000, p. 73f). Although in this field and according to the authors' knowledge there is no research to be reported, Knockaert et al. (2009) formulated first hypotheses which take into account the balance of the political power of the participating special interest groups (SIGs) for the final implemented price structure. We therefore keep Laffont's main insight in mind and note that from a theoretic perspective there is a need to develop theoretical models, which incorporate compromises not only with respect to the price level but also with respect to the price structure.====In this paper we support, that the introduction of airport noise charges has no impact on aircraft use and the reason for this is rather of political nature.====In order to test this hypothesis empirically, we employ methods of choice modeling on actual production processes of airlines. In particular, we model aircraft choice by airlines. We are thus in position to test the effect of noise charges alongside various other operational factors on aircraft choice probability. The required data for this is available for the airport of Zurich-Kloten from the year 2005.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some main elements of positive theory of regulation. Section 3 deals with political aspects in airport pricing and explains the interests of different participating actors. Section 4 introduces the issue of noise emissions and regulatory conditions in Zurich and presents the airports charging structure of 2005, followed by a theoretical discussion on the effects of an emission-based airport charging component in section 5.

For a long time, air cargo was considered a by-product of passenger services in air transport and airlines paid little attention to the air cargo segment. However, since a number of years, air cargo has become an important revenue source for the majority of traditional passenger carriers (Budd & Ison, 2017). The air cargo revenues of such airlines depend mainly on the average yield and the total quantity of cargo transported. While the average current yield in 2018 is around 2 USD per kilogram, it is expected to decrease in the coming years due to growing overcapacity in the market. Airlines have two possibilities to increase their revenue from the cargo business: find a niche market with a high yield or increase the overall amount of cargo. While airlines carry a number of product types, traditionally airports focus on the development of the growing fresh goods (perishables) and pharmaceutical market. However, since a number of years, e-commerce also becomes more and more important to airports as well as airlines: not because of the high yield e-commerce brings, but as it is seen as a booming market. That is why some European carriers take strategic actions to attract more e-commerce goods. Also airports – as the major service providers for airlines – need to prepare themselves for the unrivalled growth in e-commerce that is expected in the next couple of years. Until recently, studies on e-commerce were scarce. While e-commerce logistics has been looked at mainly from the operational point of view (e.g. Asosheh, Shahidi-Nejad, & Khodkari, 2012; Cárdenas et al., 2017b; Cárdenas, Vanelslander, Smet, Dewulf, & Beckers, 2017c; Gingerich & Maoh, 2019), no studies have yet been carried out on airports and e-commerce. This paper tries to fill this research gap by analysing how airports can attract e-commerce and which factors are important in doing so.====First, the development of air cargo and role of e-commerce are studied. Second, the relevant factors for airports to attract (cross-border) e-commerce are identified by means of a literature review. Then, the methodology that is applied in order to answer which factors are important to attract e-commerce to airports, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), is explained. Furthermore, the results of the AHP are discussed.

The highest proportion of the NACE C29.1 value (Manufacture of other transport equipment) to an overall NACE value reached in 2016, according to the Eurostat (2019) figures, is in the following countries: Slovakia (13.43%), Hungary (11.28%) and the Czech Republic (11.06%). Germany is the country with the highest absolute value of automotive production. Its production value of 397,516 million euro in 2016 is 5.4 times higher than the second-largest producer, the United Kingdom. The proportion of the automotive sector to the overall economy ranked Germany in the fourth position among European Union countries with 7.03% contribution. According to ACEA (2019), 13.3 million Europeans (6.1% of all employed people) were working in the automotive industry in 2016. For many countries, high employment in the sector represents a systematic risk which requires detailed analysis and precautionary policies. The single market and international shareholding enable positive and negative economic spill over effects and therefore make monitoring and forecasting of the automotive sector relevant to less dependent economies. Various economic entities are interested in the performance of the automotive industry. Governments and central banks monitor the sector's stability and development as it directly affects national accounts and the stability of the economic system itself. Although a long-term analysis of the industry is one of the main interests, short term analysis can be used for the issuance of extraordinary policies, such as car scrappage programmes. Several European countries were able to introduce car scrappage programmes in 2009 as a response to the financial and economic crisis, which started only one year before (Cantos-Sánchez, Gutiérrez-i-Puigarnau, & Mulalic, 2018). Stronger competitiveness in the automotive sector puts more pressure on production efficiency. This involves better utilisations of the production factors and short-term planning in general. Sa-Ngasoongsong, Bukkapatnam, Kim, Iyer, and Suresh (2012) identify the predictive horizon of 6–24 months as important for production planning due to the 12–60 months of the concept-to-release time. An important group is financial investors who evaluate growth prospects and assess risks of the investment opportunities in the short window. Although households do not use sophisticated predictive models to gauge economic outlooks, short term predictions are inevitably considered when any large asset is being purchased. Buying a car is an important financial decision for both households and companies which involves cost-benefit thinking (Chng, White, Abraham, & Skippon, 2019). It is a question to which extent short-term impulses affect purchasing behaviour.====The high complexity of the automotive sector requires a thorough analysis which goes further than a single time-series analysis. Current literature points to the various dimensions of the problem. It proposes different methodologies to tackle problems connected to the automotive sector performance or car sales/demand forecasting. One of them is the identification of factors influencing the passenger car demand, which spans over multiple disciplines from marketing, socioeconomics, macroeconomics, individual sector analysis, energy- and environment-related topics. However, these factors are often used as a separate set of factors. Moreover, studies usually connect those variables to a particular aspect of the car industry, such as environmental impacts of the transportation, preference of ultra-low emission vehicles based on the psychological factors or focus on the long-term analysis of technological and macroeconomic cycles. The interrelationship between factors or set of factors is not the core focus of the literature.====We add to this literature a new perspective: we provide short-term predictions which are based on the macro and socioeconomic factors observed in the medium-term window while carefully evaluating in-year seasonal effects. Estimated models reflect historical development and seasonality pattern in each country separately. Instead of forecasting car sales or total production of the automotive sector, we use the monthly data of new passenger car registrations to assess a dynamic of development in a one-year predictive window. The predictive part of our results might be used as an early warning system, while the variable analysis can help policymakers to focus on relevant dimensions when issuing a new policy.====The aim of the paper is to determine which macroeconomic and socioeconomic indicators have significant predictive power in the development of the automotive sector in the short-term horizon. We have set three research questions to outline our research framework, which would allow us to understand the dynamics of the car registrations in Europe.====By a short-term pattern, we understand seasonal fluctuations which occur within the period of one year. We define a medium-term as a common pattern over one wave of an economic cycle. Long term cycles typically span more than a decade and are not considered in our analysis.====We expect that the significance and magnitude of macro and socioeconomic effects on the automotive industry will differ from country to country. However, many countries share a similar cultural, economic, and historical background. Therefore, common patterns should possibly appear and might be useful for forecasting.====After statistically significant predictors are identified, the overall magnitude of the effect will be analysed. Selected Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) allows us to measure and visualise the estimated effect of change of explanatory change on the dependent variable over time.====This paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 presents a literature review on passenger car forecasting. This part discusses economic factors and variables which are commonly used for forecasting in the automotive sector and reviews analytical methods and techniques which are being used in the literature.

The estimation was performed with ","As known to us all, transportation safety has been a worldwide question confronted by all the countries and regions, which is not only an important issue in transportation field, but in economic implication (Savage, 2013). In the past decade, various approaches and perspectives (Lord & Mannering, 2010; Mannering & Bhat, 2014; Savolainen, Mannering, Lord, & Quddus, 2011) have been proposed to evaluate the transportation safety. A large number of methods and approaches, such as on-site investigation, mathematical modeling, and simulation, have been employed to evaluate the crash injury severity. Among all these, econometric modeling approaches, which specifically focus on the analysis of injury severity from the perspective of transportation safety and its economic implications, have been verified to be promising.====Among the safety studies, the heterogeneity issue due to unobserved factors among signalized intersections as well as the interdependence of observations (multiple intersections on the same arterial) has been prominent and investigated by various scholars from crash frequency or injury severity. For instance, Chin and Quddus (2003) utilized the random-effects negative binomial model to identify the elements affecting intersection safety in Singapore, attempting to address the heterogeneity problem. Subsequently, Wang and Abdel-Aty (2006) and Wang, Abdel-Aty, and Chen (2007) investigated the rear-end crash frequency at signalized intersections using the generalized estimating equations approach to account for temporal or spatial correlations within the dataset, which required that the same correlation matrix be used for different corridors. Later, Guo, Wang, and Abdel-Aty (2010) combined the Poisson and negative binomial models with a Bayesian approach to evaluate the intersection safety with reference to corridor-level spatial correlations between 170 signalized intersections in Florida. The results indicated that the Poisson spatial model provided the best model fit and that its performance was related to the proximity function.====In recent years, random parameters approach has been widely applied in crash injury severity analysis for its ability to capture unobserved heterogeneity by allowing the parameters to vary randomly across individual observations (Eluru, Bhat, & Hensher, 2008; Milton, Shankar, & Mannering, 2008; Kim, Ulfarsson, Shankar, & Mannering, 2010; Anastasopoulos & Mannering, 2011; Anastasopoulos, Mannering, Shankar, & Haddock, 2012; Abay, 2013; Aziz, Ukkusuri, & Hasan, 2013). However, crashes occurring at the same arterial probably share common unobserved factors. The distributional assumption required to estimate the random parameters may not adequately address this unobserved group-specific feature (Mannering & Bhat, 2014; Velmurugan, Padma, Madhu, Anuradha, & Gangopadhyay, 2013). Ignoring this within-intersection correlation or cross-intersection heterogeneity results in inaccurate or biased estimates (Huang, Chin, & Haque, 2008; Jones & Jorgensen, 2003; Kim, Lee, Washington, & Choi, 2007; Xu et al., 2016).====Meanwhile, within the heterogeneity issue, another major concern gaining growing interest is the spatial heterogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity is referred to differences among intersections and arterials across spatial units, while spatial heteroscedasticity is referred to heterogeneity in the variance of the unobserved component across spatial units (Marcucci & Gatta, 2012). Similarly, ignoring this spatial issue can lead to inconsistent parameters estimation (Ding, Wang, Yang, Liu, & Lin, 2016; Pavlyuk, 2016). In order to accommodate the spatial context, multilevel analysis can satisfy the requirements, which accounts for spatial autocorrelation among the individuals located in the same spatial unit by estimating coefficients varying by group, as well as spatial heterogeneity among individuals by estimating the variances at different levels. Recently, the multilevel/hierarchical modeling framework has been widely applied in safety analysis (Abdalla, 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2008; Haque, Chin, & Huang, 2010; Yu & Abdel-Aty, 2014; Chen, Zhang, Tian, Bogus, & Yang, 2015; Xu, Huang, Dong, & Wong, 2017; Zeng, Sun, & Wen, 2017; Kim, Kho, & Kim, 2017; Meng et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018).The latest studies by Ma, Chen, and Chen (2017), Liu and Sharma (2018) have addressed the spatial issue from the perspective of multivariate modeling. To accommodate the spatial issue at signalized intersections, Xu et al. (2016) and Zeng et al. (2019) proposed Bayesian spatial logit models, which is the foundation of this study.====Although the studies above have highlighted the need to accommodate the heterogeneity at signalized intersections, identification of spatial issue at signalized intersections is still sparse. Pointed to this issue, this study addresses the spatial heterogeneity in exploring the impact of influencing factors on injury severity at signalized intersections. Applying multilevel model to crash injury severity at signalized intersections can reveal the effect of influencing factors on injury severity levels, as well as addressing the spatial heterogeneity across the arterials formed by the intersections, and providing practical insights into the connection between intersections and arterials. Bayesian estimation approach is employed and the comparison between the conventional model and multilevel model is conducted. The following sections give the data description and the methodology, followed by the results and discussion.

Several different correlations are found with respect to the share of low-cost, full-service and charter carriers as a proportion of total airport traffic, which in most cases extends the findings of the limited number of other studies in the field of small regional airports. The research concludes that while certain relationships can be found, their statistical significance is moderate, leaving scope for a deeper study into a smaller samples of airports.","Airport-airline relationships in Europe have been transforming in recent years (Starkie, 2012). As the Copenhagen Economics (2012) report for IATA summarises, there is increasing competition between airports for airline services.====Some airport operators have tried to make themselves more attractive to particular carriers by redeveloping their existing infrastructure or constructing new airports (e.g. Warsaw Modlin Airport) in a way that supports particular traffic types (Njoya & Niemeier, 2011). Also, regional authorities and private business entities have subsidised air services, hoping that the resulting inbound traffic would propel the local economy and tourism (Bel, 2009; Francis, Fidato, & Humphreys, 2003).====The general framework of airport-airline relationships and airport route network development strategies have been explored by Graham (2014, 2013). Others have investigated causalities between airline traffic and more specific variables, such as catchment area expansion (Pantazis & Liefner, 2006), route volatility (Humphreys et al., 2006), airline negotiating power (Francis, Humphreys, & Ison, 2004; Gillen and Lall, 2003), airfare levels (Barbot, 2006; Malighetti, Paleari, & Redondi, 2009), incentive schemes (Starkie, 2012), airport commercial revenues (Lei and Papatherodou, 2010) and financial performance (Papatherodou and Lei, 2006; Graham & Dennis, 2007).====The network strategies of many airlines have been changing. It has been recently identified that European Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) are increasingly focussed on major gateways, often at the expense of regional airports (Dobruszkes, Givoni, & Vowles, 2017; Dziedzic & Warnock-Smith, 2016). Moreover, there are some fully-operational, newly-opened regional airports that are struggling to find sufficient demand from airlines (e.g. Radom Airport in Poland). This demonstrates there is still not enough understanding of how airports can attract airlines. Given the fact that European carriers are increasingly footloose in their network decisions (Humphreys et al., 2006; Copenhagen Economics, 2012), the question arises as to how airport operators may secure an appropriate level of traffic in the years to come.====These trends are particularly problematic for regional airports, which are often expected by their local communities to establish new routes and connections around the world. On the other hand limited interest from the airlines and changing market dynamics make this task for regional airports very difficult to achieve. Also the problem of securing a minimum scale of traffic can be very troublesome for small regional airports, which are, due to their size, very exposed to airlines changing their route networks, sometimes at quite short notice.====The literature to date has focussed primarily on larger airports (Akar, 2013; Berechman & de Wit, 1996; Dobruszkes, Lennert, & Van Hamme, 2011; Dziedzic & Warnock-Smith, 2016; Welch & Wang, 2014) yet smaller regional airports have their own problems and specificities, which make it worthwhile to explore them further with a view to discovering what they can do to attract traffic. Both the literature and the market trends leave scope for further study into the determinants and structure of airport traffic volumes at smaller airports.====Given there is already a fledgling body of research into airport choice factors amongst European carriers, the geographical scope of this research into smaller airports will be restricted to Europe, leading to the following research objectives:====The determinants of smaller regional airport traffic volumes and traffic structure were analysed through the use of multiple linear regression and correlation analysis respectively with the controllable (directly or indirectly) factors being focussed on when discussing managerial implications for smaller airport operators.====The process adopted for this piece of research is summarised below in Fig. 1.====The rest of this paper is broken down as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature involving airline and airport route network developments and categories of airport choice factors, introducing some real-industry examples. Section 3 presents the methodology with the obtained results being detailed in Section 4 covering regional airport traffic volumes, volatility and their relationship with airport choice factors.

Although the viability and future of airport-led transfer schemes that entail an airport-airline-co-operation is heavily dependent on airline participation, their role and what could promote or impede their adoption decision is generally absent from academic literature. Therefore, this paper analyses the potential drivers and barriers for the airline adoption of airport facilitated inter-airline network connectivity schemes. In order to achieve this, a case study research strategy was employed and the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data was attained through a combination of literature, interview and ","The world's air transport industry has seen tremendous change in the post-deregulation era (Oum & Park, 1997) but it was primarily the advent of the Low-Cost Carrier (LCC) business model (Ito & Lee, 2003) and the emergence of the hub-and-spoke networks (Burghouwt, 2007) that shaped the dynamic and hyper-competitive airline industry landscape.====Designing powerful hub-and-spoke networks enabled airlines not only to build the so-called ‘Network Fortresses’ (Tretheway & Waters, 1998), it simultaneously made airline partnerships more attractive as the spatial and temporal concentration of flights enabled efficient connectivity among the partners (Pels, 2001). This first manifested in strategic interline partnerships (Philips, 1987) and culminates today in multilateral and globe-spanning alliances and joint ventures (Seabury, 2015).====On the contrary, the emerging archetypical LCC business model was based on a strict Point-to-Point (P2P) regime without any network connectivity, not online and most certainly not interline with partners (Fageda, Suau-Sanchez, & Mason, 2015). Through the unprecedented growth of these new breed of carriers, the amount and size of non-connected airline networks grew exponentially and some passengers began to self-connect those networks by purchasing separate tickets and handling the transfer themselves (Suau-Sanchez, Voltes-Dorta, & Rodríguez-Déniz, 2017).====Almost 40 years after the airline deregulation first took off in the US (Doganis, 2010), these two key industry developments seem to converge as LCCs begin to signal their interest in network connectivity (de Wit & Zuidberg, 2012) and airline partnerships (Morandi, Malighetti, Paleari, & Redondi, 2015). A noteworthy development in that respect is the emergence of so-called airport-led transfer schemes (Maertens, Pabst, & Grimme, 2016a) which do have the potential to alter the airline industries’ approach towards network connectivity and airline partnerships.====It was in the mid-2000s, when the first airports with a high volume of LCC traffic realised the potential of the non-connected airline networks at their doorstep and implemented innovative transfer schemes intending to facilitate the passengers' self-connection (Maertens et al., 2016a). The very first two airport-led transfer schemes, ‘viaberlin’ and ‘Cologne Bonn Connect’, lasted only a few years. However, shortly after their discontinuance the current schemes at Milan-Malpensa (2011), Singapore (2012), London-Gatwick (2013) and London-Stansted (2018) were launched. While all four schemes share similar characteristics, they differ in one key aspect: airline participation. While ‘ViaMilano’ for instance operates independently from the airlines, ‘GatwickConnects’ entails an airport-airline-co-operation (Fichert & Klophaus, 2016). Fig. 1 shows the different types of airport-led transfer schemes and where this paper fits in terms of scope.====In 2017, easyJet announced their ‘Worldwide by easyJet’ platform which can be described as the next leap in the passenger self-connectivity evolution driven this time by an airline. The platform can be best described as a digital virtual hub that enables self-connect and sales partnerships between easyJet and its participating carriers. EasyJet initially based their platform on the already developed self-connect itinerary identification technology of Dohop and the existing self-connect infrastructure of GatwickConnects (easyJet, 2017).====It was also in the mid-2000s, when the topic of self-connectivity and airport-led transfer schemes received first notable academic interest (e.g. Burghouwt, 2007; Grimme, 2008; Malighetti, Paleari, & Redondi, 2008), although today the relevant literature is still sparse (Cattenao, 2017; Cserep, 2017; Suau-Sanchez, Voltes-Dorta, & Rodríguez-Déniz, 2016; Zeigler, Pagliari, Suau-Sanchez, Malighetti, & Redondi, 2017) and mainly revolves around the potential and what implications it has for the airports. The potential implications for airlines have received very limited attention, which is somewhat surprising as network connectivity has always been under the sovereignty of the airlines and airport-led transfer schemes, at least to some extent, try to challenge that status quo.====Although airport-led transfer schemes have been around for more than 10 years now, the concept is still innovative and only at the onset of its potential diffusion. In this regard, an innovation can add value to an airline if it either solves a major problem or creates a competitive advantage (Franke, 2007), both of which airport-led transfer schemes could potentially achieve with respect to online and interline network connectivity. The benefits an airline could potentially generate by adopting such schemes are somewhat similar to the benefits associated with traditional airline partnerships, for instance access to additional feed or an extended network reach (Bissessur & Alamdari, 1998). Consequently, it can be argued that airport-led transfer schemes could challenge the legacy partnership mechanisms of interlining and codesharing, especially as they offer a solution to those carriers that do not connect today because of technological limitations or business model implications.====Hence, against this background, the focus of this paper is on interline network connectivity and in particular on how airport led-transfer schemes can act as an innovative partnership mechanism for airlines that do not connect today. As a consequence, and to stress our research focus, we introduce the term ‘airport facilitated inter-airline network connectivity schemes’ (AFINCSs) and use this instead of the more generic term ‘airport-led transfer schemes’ where applicable.====While much has been written about traditional airline partnerships (e.g. Ginieis, Sánchez-Rebull, & Campsa-Planas, 2012), little is known about what could actually promote or impede the airlines' adoption of airport-led transfer schemes to establish interline network connectivity. Beyond the overarching motivation to attract incremental passengers (Maertens et al., 2016a), only a few positive and negative aspects are sparingly mentioned in the academic literature, while a holistic understanding of potential drivers and barriers is clearly non-existent. This is an obvious gap in the academic literature that requires further investigation as the viability and future of airport-led transfer schemes that entail an airport-airline-co-operation is heavily dependent on the airlines’ participation. Thus, the aim is of this paper is to unveil, rank and assess the perceived drivers and barriers impacting the airline adoption of AFINCSs. In order to fulfil this aim we employ a mixed-method approach. Firstly, we identify the drivers and barriers from the existing relevant literature as well as expert interviews. Secondly, we use a survey to collect intelligence on how industry professionals perceive the previously identified drivers and barriers.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review the literature on airline partnerships as well as the perspective of passengers, airports and airlines on airport-led transfer schemes. Section 3 presents the methods and the analytical framework we use for the analysis in order to reach our research objective.

The framework incorporates stochastic queuing and mode choice modelling to comprehensively measure the impacts of ==== crossing investments. Border crossing scenarios include a 35% reduction in delay; a 4-min reduction in delay; and a reduction in delay resulting from the addition of one extra lane of capacity to each Canadian border crossing. Results suggest that the effects of border crossing investments and priorities are highly sensitive to delay modelling and mode splits, and less sensitive to mode shifts that result from investments. The proposed approach suggests Ambassador Bridge, Sarnia, and Fort Erie are the three most important border crossings for Canada's export competitiveness. A comparative analysis reveals that disregarding the real-world characteristics of the transportation system can result in large errors in the estimated impacts of border crossing investments on Canada's exports.","Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models have been used extensively for assessing the economic impacts of transportation policies and projects. CGE applications in transportation include road pricing, disaster evaluation/management, transportation network changes, infrastructure investment/financing, land-use impacts, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), infrastructure interdependencies, trade agreements, and border crossing infrastructure investment - which is the focus of this paper. CGE models are an attractive tool for modelling the economic impacts of transportation policies and projects because of their capability to capture industrial interdependencies and distributional effects with the simultaneous consideration of prices and quantities - which are essential for analyzing trade and transportation applications and absent from other evaluation methods such as Input-Output (IO) models and benefit-cost analysis. For reviews of CGE applications in transportation, refer to Bröcker (2004, pp. 269–289), chap. 16, Bröcker and Mercenier (2011), Robson and Dixit (2015), and Shahrokhi Shahraki and Bachmann (2018).====CGE applications in border crossing investment analysis suffer from some limitations: first, most studies use a stylistic approach in representing transportation in their models as well as in simulating the impacts of infrastructure investment. Often, it is assumed that border crossing investments have the same impacts on all industries, which is unrealistic. Second, studies often compare the impacts of border crossing investments using a constant relative or absolute reduction of delay at each border crossing; this approach results in incomparable investments in border crossings - i.e., equal investments in border crossings result in different delay reductions for different border crossings. Lastly, previous studies often disregard freight mode splits and the mode shifts that may result from investments in only one mode of transportation. As the results of this paper shows, these limitations may result in specious insights.====This study proposes a framework that migrates from stylized CGE modelling by explicitly linking empirically calibrated transportation models of border crossing activities and transportation databases to a CGE model of the global economy to comprehensively evaluate the economic impacts of infrastructure investments. The framework takes advantage of transportation sub-models (e.g., from stochastic queuing theory for modelling border crossing delays) and numerous trade and transportation databases to capture the unique impacts of individual border crossing improvements on individual industries. The use of transportation models and empirical transportation datasets in the framework enables the design of comparable investment scenarios, as opposed to stylistically reducing wait times by the same amount for all border crossings. Freight mode splits and mode shifts are taken into consideration through the use of numerous transportation and trade databases, as well as a mode choice sub-model. The application of the framework to prioritizing Canada-US border crossings suggest that results are highly sensitive to delay modelling and mode splits, and less sensitive to the resulting mode shifts.====As the results of this study illustrate, modelling assumptions related to the operational impacts of border crossing investments, industrial-level impacts of border crossing investments, and freight mode splits may result in misleading insights. It is the motivation of this study to highlight the ramifications of these assumptions, which have been used previously in determining the impacts of border crossing infrastructure investments. Additionally, the Canada-US border presents an ideal-case study for the proposed framework because of its complexity and significance. First, there are multiple crossings with heterogenous configurations. Second, industry sectors are not uniformly distributed throughout either country and thus rely on unique subsets of crossings. Third, border crossing are of varying usage and importance; for example, Ambassador Bridge alone is responsible for more than 50% of the trade from Canada to the US.====The remainder of the paper is as follows: the literature review is presented first, which is followed by a description of the framework developed in this research. Next, a summary of databases used in this research is presented, which is followed by a description of the application and the results. Next, a discussion of the results is presented.

The contribution of this research is that the convergence order and the factors affecting the difference in convergence rates are analysed using improved ,"This paper attempts to analyse the spatial convergence of China's transportation structure and the degree of influence of different factors on the convergence rate.==== The transportation structure reflects the regional transportation capacity and the convenience of communicating with outside regions. It reveals the geographical space characteristics of the regional transportation network from a regional transportation structure perspective (Lesage & Polasek, 2008). On the one hand, the trade cost between regions will be affected by the accessibility and transportation density of inter-regional traffic routes. On the other hand, the uneven development of inter-regional traffic line density will hinder the free flow of population and the optimal allocation of resources (Iacono & Levinson, 2016). Therefore, the spatial convergence of the transportation structure is very important for regional economics.====Convergence of the transportation structure in regions tests whether the structure of the transportation infrastructure in different regions has developed in a balanced way or not, which also indicates a convergence of transportation efficiency and of economic growth. The spatial convergence of the transportation structure will promote the regional convergence of regional price levels and economic growth (Liu, Su, Chang, & Xiong, 2018). If there is no spatial convergence in the transportation structure of different provinces in a certain region, then there may be problems in the connections of transportation spaces between different provinces in this region, and an unbalanced development of the interregional transportation structure may lead to interregional trade barriers or high transportation costs in some regions. The study of this phenomenon will deepen our understanding of the reasons for economic convergence.====At present, China has the world's longest high-speed rail lines and expressways. In terms of railways, by the end of 2017, the length of China's operating lines reached 127,000 km, 2.5 times that of 1978. In particular, the high-speed railway system had reached 25,000 km, accounting for two-thirds of the total length of high-speed railways in the world and covering 65% of the cities with a population of more than one million. By the end of 2017, the highways had reached a length of 4.7735 million kilometres, 5.4 times that of 1978.==== Additionally, there are significant differences in transportation infrastructure across regions in China. In this context, the research on the convergence of the transportation structure can help us to understand whether the connectivity efficiency of regional infrastructure construction is consistent and which regions need effective and reasonable improvements in the transportation infrastructure.====At the same time, the value of this topic also lies in the analysis of the spatial convergence order of the transportation structure and the influencing factors. Convergence order means the rate of regional transportation structure improvement, which is helpful for analysing the regional balance of transportation networks. The factors leading to preferential convergence are exactly the aspects that need to be improved in the areas with backward convergence rates. First, the convergence of transportation structures will be affected by the level of economic development, and regional economic growth will increase the demand for transportation capacity, which could improve the transportation structure optimization within regions (Ng, Law, Wong, & Kulanthayan, 2017). Second, the reasonable urbanization of regional populations requires the balanced development of regional transportation structures, while urbanization varies within different regions (Maparu & Mazumder, 2017). Third, the degree of local protectionism will affect the accessibility and traffic connections with other regions (Lin, 1993). Finally, the high-speed railway plays an important role in shortening the distance between time and space and promoting the connection of different transportation structures (Chen & Haynes, 2017). However, a quantitative analysis of the degree of influence of these factors on the order of convergence is lacking; thus, it will be considered in this paper.====The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, most previous studies consider only whether convergence characteristics exist across regions, while they neglect the important issue of the order of convergence. The rate of convergence is close to a steady state level in different regions, which reflects the balance and stability of the transportation structure in these regions. It is also possible to investigate the interaction between regions and the existence of spatial spillover effects of transportation from the order of transportation.====Second, we use improved SPSM to test whether there is evidence for the convergence of the spatial transportation structure in China's provinces. Our methodological contribution is that we introduce the Fourier transform into a traditional SPSM model. Traditional studies do not consider structural mutations or ignore the convergence rate of different regions, which indicates that the Fourier transform can capture the characteristics of structural mutations more effectively than other methods (Enders & Lee, 2012). The Ucar-Omay (OU) statistics are obtained by a bootstrap simulation (Ucar & Omay, 2009).====Third, this paper is the first to econometrically study the influence of different factors on the convergence order of transportation infrastructure. We find the convergence of China's transportation system within different provinces, except for Hubei province. For the different regions, the eastern and western regions have local convergence characteristics, while the central region presents non-convergence characteristics. We also find that urbanization promotes the convergence of the transportation structure, while local protectionism hinders the spatial convergence of the transportation structure. Additionally, China's transportation infrastructure is more policy-driven than economic-driven. This study provides references for analysing the spatial balance of China's transportation structure and regional differences.====The remainder of the paper consists of the following sections. Section 2 proposes the literature review. Section 3 shows the methodology. Section 4 presents the data. Section 5 analyses the empirical results.

The aim was to investigate whether temporal causality exists between the variables. Using the panel vector error-correction model, we determined the long-run and short-run links between the variables. The study's most robust finding is that both financial penetration and transportation infrastructure stimulate economic growth in the long run. Short-run results, on the other hand, were non-uniform and depended on the specific measure of financial penetration and transportation infrastructure utilized.","Transportation and its related infrastructures has played a pivotal role==== in economic growth (Arvin, Pradhan, & Norman, 2015; Beyzatlar, Karacal, & Yetkiner, 2014a, 2014b; Lenz, Skender, & Mirkovic, 2018; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013). Hence, studying the relationship between the two has received much attention in the development literature (Banister, 2012; World Bank, 1994). Whether transportation infrastructure and economic growth are connected has long been debated. A substantial number of empirical studies examined the relationship between transportation infrastructure and economic growth in both developed and developing countries (Achour & Belloumi, 2016; Button & Yuan, 2013; Calderon, Moral-Bemito, & Serven, 2015; Chi & Baek, 2013; Deng, Shao, Yang, & Zhang, 2014; Ding, 2013; Farhadi, 2015; Gillen, 1996; Hakim & Merkert, 2016; Hulten, Bennathan, & Srinivasan, 2006; Jiang, 2001; Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2007; Mohmand, Wang, & Saeed, 2016; Munnell, 1992; Oster, Rubin, & Strong, 1997; Phang, 2003; Vidyarthi & Sharma, 2014; World Bank, 1994).====There are at least three ways we can justify the links between transportation infrastructure and economic growth. First, transportation infrastructure can enter the production process as direct input and, in many cases, as an unpaid factor of production. Second, transportation infrastructure may make other existing inputs more productive. Third, transportation infrastructure can act as a magnet for regional economic growth by attracting resources from other regions, which is called agglomeration (Fernald, 1999; Hong, Chu, & Wang, 2011; Kasarda & Green, 2005; Kawakami & Doi, 2004; Kayode, Babatunde, & Abiodun, 2013; Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2010; Linneker & Spence, 1996; Loo & Banister, 2016; Marazzo, Scherre, & Fernandes, 2010; Meersman & Van de Voorde, 2013; Nakamura, 2000; Njoh, 2000; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013; Wang, 2002; Yamaguchi, 2007; Yao & Yang, 2012; Yu, De Jong, Storm, & Mi, 2012).====The majority of the empirical studies used the production function approach to examine these links. In most cases, the causality direction observed was from the transportation infrastructure to economic growth. However, in reality, there is a feedback relationship, that is, there is a bidirectional causality between the two factors. Additionally, the development literature supports the notion that financial penetration==== is an important factor that can affect the nexus between transportation infrastructure and economic growth.====Transportation infrastructure is normally vital to foster countries' economic development and prosperity (Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2008, 2009). It is considered that in today's era of globalization, the competitive advantage of each country exclusively depends on facilitating a more efficient transportation infrastructure, while a key obstacle can be the lack of an efficient and high quality transportation infrastructure (Lenz et al., 2018). The provision of this requirement depends on high investments in transportation infrastructure (Think 20, 2019). Investments in transportation infrastructure contribute to higher productivity and growth, facilitate trade and connectivity, and promote economic inclusion. In short, to be able to supply an appropriate transportation infrastructure to enhance economic growth requires a considerable investment. However, the experiences of many countries show that it is difficult to depend only on the public sector==== to finance the country's increasing transportation requirements,==== which has led to the development of the transportation infrastructure privatization concept (Navai, 1998; Shashikumar, 1998). This means that the development of the financial sector is one of steps towards being able to finance the transportation infrastructure. Financial institutions can play a leading role in attracting more investments in the transportation infrastructure. There are at least three ways we can justify the financial penetration requirement for the nexus between transportation infrastructure and economic growth.====Hence, the objective of this paper is to examine how financial penetration can affect the nexus between transportation infrastructure and economic growth. This study may be crucial for the effective implementation of both financial and transportation policies to increase economic growth. For instance, the causality running from transportation infrastructure to economic growth indicates that infrastructure impacts on the economy. Thus, economic development strategies should ensure a strong focus on creating an effective transportation infrastructure to boost the local economy. There is a possibility that the significance and magnitude of this relationship may differ, depending on the types of transportation infrastructure planned and built. Sound research should be undertaken before determining any transportation policies and strategies (Arvin et al., 2015; Baker, Merkert, & Kamruzzaman, 2015; Pradhan & Bagchi, 2013).====The main contributions of this study are two-fold. First, we link transportation infrastructure and economic growth to financial penetration. Second, we create and utilize the composite indices of transportation infrastructure and financial penetration using principal component analysis to study the interrelationships between transportation infrastructure, economic growth, and financial penetration. It may be noted that much of the existing research on the link between transportation infrastructure and economic growth used a bivariate format (see Table A1). Hence, identifying how the additional factor of financial penetration may impact the causal link between transportation infrastructure and economic growth represents a new research approach. Manifestly the use of a trivariate causal framework in a panel setting is not common in this literature.====The study progresses as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review, Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, Section 4 details and discusses the empirical results and Section 5 outlines the hypotheses validations and limitations of the study. Section 6 presents conclusions and recommendations for future research.","Investigating the causal relationship between transportation infrastructure, financial penetration and economic growth in G-20 countries",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302781,14 November 2019,2019,Research Article,313.0

Relatively few studies have compared the role of different types of transport infrastructure simultaneously. This study attempts to examine the role of various types of transport infrastructure in ","It is important for a country to have a high degree of accessibility derived from transport infrastructure, particularly with diminishing trade barriers and the unlocking of new markets (Banister & Berechman, 2001). Accordingly, many nations and economic unions (e.g. the EU and ASEAN) attempt to spend more resources on the provision of transport infrastructure as an essential social and economic asset, as transport infrastructure determines mobility and structural space (Short & Kopp, 2005). For example, the European Commission allocated 76 billion Euros to the construction of transport infrastructure and improvements, including Trans-European Networks (TENs), during the period 2007–2013 based on a common belief that such investment not only eliminates bottlenecks but also increases employment, mobility, accessibility, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the European Union (EU) (European Commission, 2008). Further, academics of the Economic Geography of Transport enthusiastically examined whether provision of transport infrastructure contributes to regional economic growth through better accessibility and lower transport costs (Lakshmanan, 2011; Yu, De Jong, Storm, & Mi, 2012). Indeed, lower transport costs and better accessibility may enable firms to yield higher efficiency, which is derived from spatial agglomeration economies, scale economies, market expansion, and innovation benefits in spatial clusters (Lakshmanan, 2011). More specifically, agglomeration economies can be achieved through a diversity of firms, residents, and workers; on the other hand, external economies of scale can be achieved through density (Chatman & Noland, 2011). Better transport infrastructure not only promotes competitiveness, territorial cohesion, dissemination of knowledge and technology, more competition, and a wider range of choice but also reduces economic disparities (Canning and Bennathan, 2004; Vickerman, Spiekermann, & Wegener, 1999).====Notwithstanding the novelty of prior studies, most have examined the role of transport infrastructure on economic growth in a single country either at the national or regional level (e.g. USA: Cohen, 2010; Jiwattanakulpaisarn, Noland, & Graham, 2010, Berechman, Ozmen, & Ozbay, 2006, UK: Crafts, 2009, China: Lean, Huang, & Hong, 2014; Yu et al., 2012; Hong, Chu, & Wang, 2011; Fan & Chan-Kang, 2008, Korea: Park & Seo, 2016, India: Lall, 2007, Portugal: Pereira & Andraz, 2007) or a single economic region (e.g. Europe: Crescenzi & Rodriguez-Pose, 2012; Vickerman et al., 1999). However, utilising observations from a larger number of countries may be more worthwhile for examining how transportation affects economic growth generally across different countries, as long as a possible heterogeneous relationship in each country is adequately controlled. In addition, the use of panel data from a large number of countries enables comparative studies across different groups of countries. For example, when developed and developing countries are compared, greater implications of the more frequent use of transportation in economic development can be obtained. Moreover, the market for transportation—where government supply, firms, and household demand determine transportation use—has tended to be ignored in numerous studies (Hong et al., 2011). Although Lean et al. (2014) adopted the hybrid production approach, this approach simply estimates an individual equation separately without considering instrumental variables to eliminate inconsistency.====In addition, the accumulated evidence for the positive role of transport infrastructure has fragmentally reported limited types of transport infrastructure, such as roads (Crafts, 2009; Fan & Chan-Kang, 2008; Fernald, 1999), highways (Cohen, 2010; Crescenzi & Rodriguez-Pose, 2012; Jiwattanakulpaisarn et al., 2010; Rephann & Isserman, 1994), railways (Banister & Thurstain-Goodwill, 2011; Vickerman et al., 1999), seaports (Jaffee, 2015; Park & Seo, 2016), and airports (Yamaguchi, 2007). Thus, only a few studies have compared the role of different types of transport infrastructure simultaneously. In light of the aforementioned research gaps, this study attempts to examine the role of various types of transport infrastructure in the economic growth of countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. By employing the hybrid production function approach (Röller & Waverman, 2001), this study considers how the amount of the source of economic growth is determined in a market and combines a model of supply and demand with the above-mentioned economic growth model. This approach endogenises the role of the source of economic growth; its advantage is that it can avoid a bias in the results caused by simultaneity or reverse causation, which could overstate the significance of the source of economic growth. In this study, the level of transportation use is determined by its supply and demand in the transport market.====The remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner.

Grain production is particularly important to the natural resource-based economy of the upper Midwest. Exporters are at a competitive disadvantage when they are unable to obtain containers at a reasonable cost. To mitigate this shortage of containers and avoid excessive empty vehicle miles, it is proposed to strategically establish inland depots in regions with sufficiently high trade volumes. Inland depots would minimize total system costs for empty container repositioning while providing customers with desired levels of service. Mathematical models are formulated to evaluate the proposed system and implementation is performed as a case study for soybean container shipments in the study region of Minnesota. The proposed system has been demonstrated to significantly reduce empty vehicle miles travelled and total system costs, yielding benefits to regional exporters and individual stakeholders. Findings show that even if soybean trade volumes in the region remain static or decrease, inland depots will still result in noteworthy system cost and empty vehicle mile savings. Finally, the model can be applied similarly to other commodities and/or be used to analyze the potential for new intermodal points.","The United States is a leading producer of many grains and needs to use shipping methods with single-cargo capacities as large as 60,000 tons to meet the needs of export customers. Container transportation currently accounts for only a small percentage of U.S. grain transportation but its use is slowly increasing (Clott, Harman, Ogard, & Gatto, 2015). Since 2006, containerized grain shipments between the United States and Asia have more than doubled, with the upward trend expected to continue. There are several reasons for this trend. First, there is an increased demand for identity-preserved and specialized grains such as food-grade soybeans used in tofu, miso, and soy milk processing. To preserve food safety, the grain must be loaded at its production point. Identity-preserved products are those that can be traced throughout the supply chain and are easily distinguished from GMOs (genetically modified organism). This distinction is critical to global grain purchasers (Stein & Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2010). Containerized shipping facilitates easy traceability from the respective seed stock, the field the crop was grown in, and every point in transit from grain silo to final destination. Secondly, containerized imports facilitate shipping of smaller quantities, benefitting countries that otherwise cannot commit the necessary capital to import large quantities of agricultural goods. It is not economical to charter a ship unless it is mostly full, so cargoes are layered in holds separated by plastic tarpaulins. This significantly increases the likelihood of cross-contamination between crops and can pose significant quality and identity problems as well. Containerized cargo remains intact and enclosed, which can be of great benefit to markets in Asia which have little storage capacity. In addition, bulk grain terminals in developed countries are typically less efficient than container terminals, where there has been more restructuring to support growth (Merk & Deng, 2012). Containerization allows for significantly expanded transportation alternatives with minimum public-sector investment, if containers can be loaded at the terminal to full capacity (Kulisch, 2013).====An increasing imbalance of available empty containers has developed because of growing demand for U.S. exports and an economic downturn that is slowing the growth of imports. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ship goods overseas because of the lack of available containers, particularly for inland exporters. U.S.-based exporters also face challenges arising from the distances between the loading and unloading of products, and from rising energy and transportation costs. Exporters are at a competitive disadvantage because they are unable to obtain a reasonable supply of containers at a reasonable cost. New market entrants face these barriers as they attempt to serve new markets. The U.S. departments of Commerce, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture, as well as industry coalitions (Ken et al., 2010; Meade et al., 2016) are acting on instructions from the President of the United States and are trying to identify critical issues that hinder an increase in exports (Ken et al., 2010; Meade et al., 2016). The general consensus across these agencies and groups is that transportation costs must decrease to sustain and enhance U.S. agricultural export competitiveness.====In the shipping industry, there are headhauls and backhauls. Headhauls are typically movements of higher-value consumer products or product components. These movements are the primary haul, so shippers pay a premium for contracted container transportation with a nominal repositioning fee. Backhauls are necessary to reload and relocate containers back to import markets for recirculation. The velocity and recycle speed between headhauls is a critical factor in a carrier's container supply profitability. Recently, the oversupply of ocean capacity has led carriers to avoid repositioning empty containers.====Inland container depots are dry ports equipped for handling and temporary storage of containerized cargo as well as empty containers. These depots allow customers in remote locations to receive port services more conveniently and closer to their premises. Ocean carriers tended to reduce the number of supported container depots and simplified their inland networks. Service was discontinued in some unbalanced lanes. For example, Wisconsin exporters now must truck containers to intermodal loading centers in Illinois because of the recent closure of the Milwaukee Intermodal Terminal on the Canadian Pacific Railroad (Ogard, 2012).====The combination of these factors has created a strong need for inland container depots which would result in reduced drayage and increased access to empty containers. To maintain U.S. competitiveness for containerized grain exports, this research seeks to outline and provide a practical solution to container shortages for grain farmers at the inland regional level. The region of study for this research is the state of Minnesota and the numerical solution will be implemented as a case study for soybean container shipments.",A deterministic mathematical model to support future investment decisions for developing inland container terminals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302768,5 November 2019,2019,Research Article,315.0

We assume that the motor carrier ,"Safety enhancements provide incentives for mass adoption of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies in the motor carrier industry, and as a result, assumptions are made that motor carriers (defined here as a single-unit truck with two or more axles, truck tractors, and other heavy trucks) will be one of the first adopters of automated driving capabilities that most likely will be first applied to our national interstate system. AV technology can replace human drivers with a computation-based decision-making process for a varying array of driving tasks. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) define levels of automation based on the extent to which driving tasks are delegated to the vehicle (SAE International, 2018), as presented in Table 1. Currently, many companies are introducing SAE level 2 and developing SAE level 3 capable vehicles, while others are opting to focus directly on level 4 automation. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we highlight the infrastructure requirements needed for widespread use of AV technology, particularly in the motor carrier industry. Within the class of AV technologies, we only focus on technologies classified as SAE level 4 high-automation and level 5 full-automation, in which the automated driving features will not require the human to overtake driving features (SAE International, 2018). Second, we try to motivate such investments by estimating the potential safety gains that are offered by such technologies.====Benefits rendered from automated technologies include retaining drivers, improving drivers’ health and wellness, reducing driver fatigue while adhering to the hours of service regulations, mitigating driver distraction, lowering fuel consumption and, most importantly, diminishing unsafe driving (Bhoopalam, Agatz, & Zuidwijk, 2017; Short & Murry, 2016). Unsafe driving behaviors for motor carrier drivers include speeding, reckless driving, improper lane change, following too closely, improper passing, driving too fast for conditions, failing to yield and distracted driving (Bernard & Mondy, 2016; Short & Murry, 2016). Though unsafe driving will not disappear, it is probable that the number of unsafe driving events will decline as drivers shift to autonomous driving (Short & Murry, 2016).====To gauge the overall safety benefits from reducing unsafe driving events/behaviors requires knowledge about the proportion of all motor carrier accidents that are attributable to human factors. Much research has been conducted to examine the devastating effects caused by collisions with motor carriers and large trucks (Bunn, Slavova, & Robertson, 2013; Islam et al., 2013; Choi, Oh, & Kim, 2014; Islam et al, 2012, 2014; Kin, Wang, & Cutler, 2014; Park, Kim, Kho, & Park, 2017; Zheng, Lu, & Lantz, 2018; Zhu et al., 2011). For example, Zhu et al. (2011) examined the effect of human, vehicle, crash and environmental characteristics using an ordered probit regression models on severity outcomes, given a crash occurs. The authors concluded opposing traffic situations and lack of vehicle familiarity poised the greatest safety risk and recommended an increase in driver training, greater vehicle familiarization and better traffic separation to mitigate the overall severity of large truck crashes (Zhu et al., 2011). Islam and Hernandez (2013) also employed ordered probit models to classify injury severity of large truck crashes and found interaction effects between human-factor and vehicle-factor variables. The authors concluded that further research is needed to improve truck driver safety (Islam & Hernandez, 2013). Additionally, Zheng et al. (2018) analyzed truck crash severity using a gradient boosting data mining model and concluded that the trucking company and driver characteristics as contributing factors have a significant effect on severity, given a commercial truck crash occurs.====Thus, the empirical analyses in this paper abstracts away from such issues by focusing only on crashes in which the motor carrier driver contributed to the occurrence of the crash. To the extent that (1) unsafe driving events cause the observed crash, (2) the diffusion of AVs will affect the number of unsafe driving events, and (3) the diffusion of AVs will not introduce new safety problems, transportation policymakers have the responsibility to facilitate the adoption of such technologies.",Highway infrastructure and safety implications of AV technology in the motor carrier industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302707,31 October 2019,2019,Research Article,316.0

The growth of transport costs and future scenarios with constrictions, for example green ==== and land transit limitations, oblige exporters to seek out alternatives, such as sea transport within an intermodal framework. The present study aims to provide a quantitative analysis for strategic decisions to promote this adaptation. The results support the change to intermodal transport and highlight the negative effects of transport cost increases on exports. They also reveal the benefits of a consolidated business nucleus at origin to avoid certain logistical problems caused by the modal switch.","Spain is the main European exporter of fruits and vegetables (F&V). In 2018, Spain exported a total value of vegetables worth 5.29 billion euros and fruits worth 7.542 billion euros (FEPEX, 2018). Nearly all these exports are transported in refrigerated trucks, making this sector extremely dependent on road transport. However, there are a number of potential risks that threaten this means of transport, for example, future eco-taxes and the trend towards increasing costs (Galati et al., 2016). Such a context makes it necessary to search for other logistics alternatives. Intermodality (trucks + ships) could be the easiest to implement.====Approached from a medium and long-term perspective, the option of using trains as an alternative means could be viable with the full completion of the so-called “Mediterranean Corridor” – a railway line that would link Algeciras (southeast Spain) with Perpignan (southeast France), running along the entire Spanish coast. This project requires the installation of twin-track freight-passenger rails with international track width, in addition to tripling the size of the current high-speed rail network and unifying railway standards with the rest of Europe. Currently, there is no project under way to unite this Corridor; there is simply a series of lines with double rails, third tracks or independent tracks with completely different projects and deadlines (AVE, 2018). Furthermore, the railway option continues to prove deficient in terms of the transportation of perishable goods (Woroniuk, Marinov, Zunder, & y Mortimer, 2013); it requires large-scale cargo groupage, which slows down journeys, and it lacks suitable cold storage infrastructures. As for sea transport, although it also displays some of the same drawbacks as rail, it would be possible to take advantage of sea transport within an intermodal framework (truck + ship). The present study presents arguments that support the strategic decision to opt for said change.====The relationship between transport costs and international trade has been investigated by several researchers (Baier & Bergstrand, 2001; Bensasi et al., 2014; Chi, 2016; Limao & Venables, 2001; Martínez-Zarzoso, Pérez-García, & Suárez-Burguet, 2008; Tiller & Thill, 2017; Xu, Fang, & Zhang, 2013). Most of them have found evidence that transport costs have a significant negative impact on trade, although this influence varies at industry and commodity levels (Chi, 2016; Martínez-Zarzoso et al., 2008; Wilmsmeier & Sanchez, 2009). However, no study has focused on perishable goods, such as F&V. Only Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2008) showed that, in the case of Spain, some sectors with high value-added are more sensitive to a transport cost change than others. Nevertheless, they did not include F&V in the analysis.====The present research will analyze F&V exports from Spain to the main import areas in the European Union in order to investigate the structural importance of transport costs. The contribution of the paper is that it provides evidence on the impact of transport costs on the volume of F&V exports in Spain using a gravity model and considering the effects of both land and intermodal transportation. Moreover, it includes environmental externalities and calculates elasticities to determine the increase in demand as a result of savings in transport costs according to the export destination.

Using a ==== regression on fares from Amsterdam to Geneva, we find flights that only differ in departure times to be weak substitutes. Fare-to-fare elasticities for imperfect substitute flights of different airlines are even smaller, implying weak competition between airlines on this specific route.","In the economic literature on civil aviation, flights are commonly thought of as imperfect substitutes (Alderighi et al., 2015; Basso, 2008; Borenstein & Netz, 1999; Lijesen & Behrens, 2017). Characteristics that affect the level of substitution include the (perceived) quality of the airline, booking restrictions, routing of the flight and time of departure. We focus on the latter and develop and apply a method to assess the level of substitutability between flights on the same route.====Understanding the nature of imperfect substitutes and its consequences for pricing is important for several reasons. First, the level of substitutability partly determines the boundaries of the relevant market (see e.g. Lijesen & Behrens, 2017), which is valuable information both for policy makers and for academics looking to assess (changes in) the level of competition. Second, the level of substitutability has an impact on price dispersion. If goods are strong substitutes, demand shocks are more likely to spread over several goods and hence cause smaller price shocks. Understanding the consequences of substitutability on pricing can therefore contribute in resolving the long-lasting debate on the impact of competition on price dispersion (Borenstein & Rose, 1994; Gerardi and Shapiro, 2009; Dai, Liu, & Serfes, 2014; Chandra & Lederman, 2016, to name but a few influential papers in this debate).====Flights from different airlines are often imperfect substitutes, as the characteristics of airlines are likely to be different. These differences range from clearly measurable features such as seat pitch to subjective judgements about quality. Most authors either use dummy variables (or fixed effects) for every airline in the analysis or run separate analyses for each airline. Booking restrictions, such as the Saturday night stay-over, used to be an important source of product heterogeneity (see e.g. Stavins, 2001). The importance of these restrictions is decreasing for short haul flights with the rise of the low-cost carrier business model, as Alderighi et al. (2015) show.====Routing is also an important product characteristic. It is commonly assumed that airlines compete on the level of city pairs, although several authors distinguish additional factors that should be considered. Lijesen (2004) shows that indirect flights are imperfect substitutes to direct flights between the same cities. Many authors (e.g. Dai et al., 2014; Gerardi and Shapiro, 2009) ignore this issue by focusing on direct flights (and hence ignore the presence of the close substitute) or by limiting the analysis to flights where indirect flights are hardly a viable alternative (e.g. Chandra & Lederman, 2016; Lijesen & Behrens, 2017).====Another routing issue is that some cities have multiple airports, or, more general, that some airports are close enough to be imperfect substitutes. This issue of competition between nearby airports has been extensively treated on a case-by-case basis (examples include Jun and Van Dender, 2009 and Pels, Nijkamp, & Rietveld, 2000). Lijesen and Behrens (2017) analyze the extent to which alternative city- or airport-pairs impact airline competition and find that the relevant market for a flight extends well beyond the city-pair level.====The impact of departure time on product homogeneity is implicitly present in the spatial competition literature (e.g. Borenstein & Netz, 1999; Salvanes et al., 2005), and the subject is briefly touched upon in Gaggero, and Piga (2011). Our paper is the first to explicitly study the impact of departure timing on the level of product homogeneity.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The use of an urban distribution centre (UDC) is a solution to minimise these impacts. This paper compares the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the implementation of a UDC in a Brazilian historical city, considering the viewpoints of the agents: residents, retailers and carriers. Having a more complete picture of these aspects by the agents, this paper also sheds light on ","Brazilian historical cities declared as world heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) are a challenge for city logistics (Oliveira et al., 2019), mainly the city centre, where there are groupings of historical buildings, a range of small retailers, narrow streets, and a high concentration of pedestrians and tourists (IPHAN, 2014a, IPHAN, 2014b). Many of these cities have cobblestone streets, rough relief, and slippery, irregular sidewalks built of soapstone (Nobre, 2002). These distinctive characteristics heighten the difficulty in delivering freight loads in these historical centres, especially on rainy days.====According to Unesco (2017), Brazil has fourteen cultural heritage sites in ten States. Heritage areas mainly consist of private properties, although some include publicly owned lands (Vincent & Comay, 2014). Considering cultural heritage sites as part of the Culture Economy (Fingueruti, Blumenschein, Souto, Leal, & Mohélsky & Pantoja, 2015), in 2010, the cultural sector represented 4% of the Brazilian GDP, 0.86% of Jobs in the Cultural Economy sector, and 27.3% of public funds (Valiati & Fialho, 2017, p. 214). The annual culture sector public spending has grown twice as much as the total national budget from 2003 to 2013 (Fingueruti et al., 2015). In 2013, the Federal government launched the Growth Acceleration for Historical Cities Program, with roughly US$ 395 million for 425 restorations of buildings and public spaces in 44 cities in 20 Brazilian states (IPHAN, 2018). Ouro Preto, the city chosen to be investigated, is the biggest set of architecture baroque, a unique characteristic in Brazil (IPHAN, 2014a, IPHAN, 2014b). Ouro Preto city was declared a National Monument in 1933, protected by IPHAN in 1938, and it was the first Brazilian city included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1980 (Oliveira, 2016), and it has (around) a thousand buildings from the colonial period (IPHAN, 2008).====Adopting rules for access to the city centre (Allen, Browne, Woodburn & Leonardi, 2012; Lin, Chen, & Kawamura, 2016; Quak, 2008) is essential for organising the urban space and supplying local commerce. In the case of historical cities, such rules are key to preserving the world heritage regarding the accessibility of cargo vehicles like a time-window and general vehicle restrictions (Carvalho, Ribeiro, Oliveira, Silva, & Vieira, 2019).====According to the Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) (2011), the organisation responsible for protecting and safeguarding cultural heritage in Brazil, the trade in historical centres is maintained as traditional and popular. These tradesmen are independent retailers that do not have optimised deliveries (Van Duin, Van Dam, Wiegmans, & Tavasszy, 2016). As a result, there is a range of small retailers that demand a large number of vehicles for frequent deliveries. These cargo vehicles do not respect the rules to preserve the world heritage, trans-shipping in forbidden places, such as at the entrance into cities and highways, and ignoring the time window. In addition, the city does not have enough protection for its heritage sites, and as a consequence, some of them have experienced fires and a lack of maintenance, as what happened on March 30th, 2019, when a door at the ‘Nossa Senhora Rosário dos Pretos' burnt down in the historical centre (Bom dia Minas, 2019).====Salvador, Bahia, another city where its historical centre is a heritage site in Brazil, also shows problems with discontinuities (Nobre, 2002), lack of transparency of public investments in restoring the buildings, squares and churches, and occupation of some buildings in historical centres by drugdealers since the 1970s, and especially from the 1990s–2000s (Reis, 2004). In addition, the preservation of this cultural/historical heritage gives local tourism the opportunity to create new jobs and income for the local population, alleviating poverty. Although advantages in investing in the maintenance of historical heritage sites in Brazil have been recognised, there are five states that do not have departments to control the use of land in these sites (Oliveira, 2016). Other Brazilian historical cities also experience these issues because of the lack of interest; some of them have spent years without having been renovated (Bispo & Giannecchini, 2015).====Given the special characteristics of historical cities, the implementation of an urban distribution centre (UDC) is an alternative for efficient urban freight transport (UFT) in terms of sustainability and preservation of historical heritage. The objective is to consolidate urban delivery service (Browne, Sweet, Woodburn, & Allen, 2005; Taniguchi & Thompson, 2015, pp. 1–12) and have space for temporary storage where retailers can withdraw or request the delivery of goods during the day. Pulawska and Starowicz (2014) explained the need for greater awareness of the historical and artistic heritage, citing a UDC as a solution for city logistics problems. In Europe, the ENCLOSE Project sensitised to the challenges of energy efficient and sustainable urban logistics in small and medium-sized historical cities (CHPMD) also addressed the use of a UDC. Although several case studies indicate that UDCs are beneficial to the functioning of urban transport systems, implementing them is a complex initiative because it is not economically or financially sustainable (Nocera & Cavallaro, 2017), and involves the coordination of different and conflicting agents (Zhou & Wang, 2014) and multiple aspects regarding logistics operations and land use control in historical cities (Björklund, Abrahamsson, & Johansson, 2017).====This paper compares the operational, economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects that influence the implementation of a UDC in a Brazilian historical city, considering the viewpoints of residents, retailers and carriers. This research also sheds light on management practices regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Knorringa & Nadvi, 2016) into UFT. The research was developed in the historical centre of Ouro Preto, which presents common characteristics of other Latin American and some European cities that are part of the World Heritage List; therefore, this research can be generalised to those cities.====The contribution of this research is to provide a theoretical framework regarding the main factors that should be considered in the implementation of a UDC in historical cities from the perspective of residents, retailers and carriers by comparing these different viewpoints. No study was found regarding the factors that influence the implementation of the UDC and that can contribute to the preservation of the historical patrimony. Furthermore, there is no study from the perspective of the agent (residents, retailers and carriers) that take into account the discussion of management practices regarding CSR in UFT.====The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the agents who may be interested in implementing a UDC and their relationships. Section 3 summarises the use of the UDC in historical cities based on the main aspects that can influence the implementation of a UDC. In section 4, we introduce the corporate social responsibility in urban freight transport. In Section 5, we describe the materials and methods. Section 6 presents the results, and Section 7 discusses the results based on the theoretical framework. Finally, in Section 8, we provide the overall conclusions of the study.","Urban distribution centres in historical cities from the perspective of residents, retailers and carriers",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302562,12 September 2019,2019,Research Article,320.0

The study relies on balanced panel data of 23 Asian countries over the period 2010 to 2016. Our findings show that the export-led growth hypothesis is valid in all the countries examined. Furthermore, and more significantly, the logistics sector performance is found to be an important enabler to trade. Therefore, economic growth in Asia is found to be conditional on the logistics performance level in the countries examined. Hence, from a policy perspective, investment in logistics infrastructure should be considered as an area of investment with the greatest possible benefits that has supreme returns for future growth in our selected countries. Finally, our results show that logistics heterogeneity among countries examined may be an explanation for the previously reported mixed results of earlier studies examining the validity of the ELG hypothesis in Asian countries.","The identification of the major sources of economic growth has dominated many studies in the economic growth literature for many years (e.g. Barro & Sala-I-Martin, 1992; Datta and Agarwal, 2004; Demurger, 2001; Ding, Haynes, & Liu, 2008). Numerous aspects of economic activity, such as exports, public infrastructures, investment in transport and telecommunications, foreign direct investment (FDI), human capital, trade, financial development, proximity to larger markets, institutional background and location costs have been pinpointed as possible determinants of economic growth.====During the past 40 years, transportation and communication have been recognised as important sectors in improving the investment climate for a country. Numerous studies have dealt with the so-called “====”. Examples include Sharif, Shahbaz, and Hille, (2019), Saidi, Shahbaz, and Akhtar (2018), Mariotti (2015), Vahrenkamp (2010), Hesse and Rodrigue (2006), Glaeser and Kohlhase (2004), and Hummels (1999). Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), developments in modes of transportation, and the technological advances of a given country have resulted in attracting FDI in that country by raising the rate of expected return due to the lowering of the cost of total investment by foreign investors. Part of this change was also associated with the removal of the physical barriers in commerce by the global international trade organisations, which resulted in an increase in international trade.====The developments in transportation, technological advances, and rapid improvement in ICT have resulted in the faster globalisation of the world economy. It is the increase in trade and the swift movement of information and services between the nations that has established the foundations of today's understanding of the logistics sector. Furthermore, the reduction of the blockades in global trade and globalisation, resulting from the new vision in global trade by the World Bank and other international organisations, has increased the value of multilateral trade, providing for a bigger share of multinational corporations in the world economy and a derived demand for supporting logistics for their activities. Furthermore, the resulting increased competition among companies nationally, and more importantly internationally, has resulted in further growth of the logistics sector.====More recently, the logistics system has been increasingly recognised as one of the central driving forces for economic growth. Logistics services deliver sectoral connections within an economy and link the national economy to the global economy. The logistic industry provides important contributions to a country's economy by creating employment opportunities, creating additional income, and facilitating foreign investment entry. In addition, it is also important in improving the competitiveness of industries and firms, as all industries today are more dependent on the logistics sector. It is interesting to note that when China's economic growth was confronted by the latest global financial crisis, the country's government implemented what was referred to as the ==== to uplift its economic growth in 2009. Remarkably, the logistics industry was the only service industry included in the plan to promote growth.====Among the many catalysts of growth discussed in the literature, export is one of the highly acknowledged contributors to economic growth, which is known as the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis. Nonetheless, the empirical findings of the ELG hypothesis have remained controversial. Past studies focused mainly on validating the vindication of the ELG hypothesis, while neglecting the role of logistics in facilitating the impact of exports on economic growth. Logistics imply more than just transportation since they cover management of warehouse, inventory management, material control and so on (Waters, 2003). Logistics, as we have shown above, provide the key element in supply chain management and help to accelerate production and the exporting process by integrating and managing the flow of inputs to produce goods and services, then transporting them to the customers (importers). Given this role, logistics could be a vital component in augmenting the export-growth relationship. To the best of our knowledge, the logistics factor has not been considered by the earlier export-growth studies, specifically the role of logistics performance in facilitating the impact of exports on economic growth. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate a logistics element into the analysis of the export-growth relationship, because better logistics performance is likely to improve the supply chain of raw material and finished goods which eventually increases productivity and output. Motivated by this need, the current research attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the impact of logistics performance on economic growth and its facilitating effect on exports-growth relationship. We believe this is an important and relevant topic which has not, to the best of our knowledge, been examined for our selected sample. The results of our study provide a rationale to explain the conflicting results reported in the literature regarding the export-led growth hypothesis. Utilising a panel data approach covering a sample of data from 23 Asian countries from 2010 to 2016, we strive for a better understanding of the ELG hypothesis and to extract additional information for policy recommendations. Furthermore, our research will also be extended to examine the exports of goods and export of services (tourism) instead of total exports alone. By so doing, the findings of the present study will not only contribute to the body of knowledge, but it will also provide better implications in policymaking, especially in enhancing the effect of exports on economic growth in Asia.====The balance of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 covers a review of the relevant literature. The empirical model, data and econometric methods used in the present study are discussed in Section 3. We detail our empirical findings in Section 4. Finally, we present our conclusion and policy recommendations in Section 5.","Logistics performance, exports, and growth: Evidence from Asian economies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302550,10 September 2019,2019,Research Article,321.0

It first analyzes the WSDOT current evaluation process and their utilization of the Highway Economic Requirement System (HERS-ST) developed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The assessment identifies some limitations. As a supplement, this study develops the HERS-ST Benefit Application Tool (HERS-ST-BAT) within Excel to improve the HERS-ST software and enhance the capabilities of evaluating highway project analyses. By combining HERS-ST-BAT and HERS-ST, the analyst is able to provide estimates for a variety of regional-level agency and user costs associated with pavement programs and more effectively consider different investment alternatives. Two separate pavement project case studies are selected to apply the HERS-ST-BAT. The results indicate that the improved process is generally applicable to various highway pavement projects. Other transportation agencies, especially for those without a statewide travel demand model, can incorporate this method for evaluating pavement improvement decisions.","Over the last several decades, the benefits of highway infrastructure have been justified in several aspects. From the micro-level perspective, the principal benefits of a highway project can include savings on travel time and vehicle operating costs, traffic accident rate reductions, and lower on-road emissions (Lawrence et al., 2015). From the macro-level view, it has the potential to create jobs and promote trade (Banister & Berechman, 2001). The U.S. government also commonly uses highway projects to fight against economic downturns (grants Overview. U., 2015).====Given the limited infrastructure funding, there is a need for policymakers to be fully informed of the costs and benefits of highway projects. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) currently utilizes the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-developed Highway Economic Requirements System, State Version (HERS-ST) model to quantify the benefits associated with new construction projects, as well as existing road improvement projects (FHWA. HERS-ST, 2005). The estimated benefits from these projects, such as reduced travel times and lower vehicle operating costs, can then be incorporated into the Computable General Equilibrium modeling system developed by REMI-TranSight to quantify broader regional economic impacts in state and local economies.====The above method is not explicitly focused on estimating the benefits of pavement improvement projects; yet such projects do extend the use and longevity of existing infrastructure (Li, Luhr, Uhlmeyer, & Mahoney, 2015). Since many small-scale pavement projects fail to yield measurable reductions in travel time or other benefits, they could be prioritized below new infrastructure construction, thus placing pavement-related improvements at a disadvantage and ultimately resulting in dilapidated highway and bridge infrastructure (Kahn & Levinson, 2011). This further illustrates the need to have tools available to state DOTs for communicating why investment in maintenance and rehabilitation should be a priority in today's fiscally-constrained environment.====This paper analyzes the current WSDOT's process for benefit estimation of highway projects and presents an improved method for pavement project evaluation. In particular, we developed the Excel-based HERS-ST Benefit Application Tool (HERS-ST-BAT) to supplement HERS-ST. It improves the existing process in three primary aspects:====Once highway pavement is constructed, it starts to deteriorate over time, mainly due to traffic and environmental factors (Gillespie et al., 1993). If appropriate strategies are implemented at the right time, however, they can slow down the deterioration and extend the pavement service life (Li, Luhr, Russell, Rydholm, & Uhlmeyer, 2017). This research focuses on the strategies related to pavement type selection and treatment type selections.",Improved methodology for benefit estimation of highway pavement projects,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919302513,5 September 2019,2019,Research Article,322.0

The private and social benefits of maintaining short line railroads is well-established in the literature, yet the cost of doing so is often prohibitive for short line operators. Thus, several assistance programs have been established, most of which are operated by the state departments of transportation. This review of these programs indicated that there is no unique methodology for administering rail freight assistance programs and evaluating applications submitted for funding, and that most of them lack clear administrative details such as published project criteria, ranking procedure and post evaluation requirements. The objectives of this paper are to present a comprehensive review of the New Jersey rail grants program, identify the shortcomings of its evaluation process and provide recommendations for improving the program's project selection criteria and application ranking. It is found that the current scores used in the evaluation process cannot always clearly differentiate between applications for funding. To that end, using the results of a targeted survey of experts, an adjustment to the current review criteria and the corresponding scores is suggested for implementation.","In the United States, railroads are designated in three classes by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) based on revenue, as follows (STB, 2017):====Class I and Class II carriers are referred to as national and regional railroads, respectively. The Staggers Act of 1980 deregulated the American railroad industry and led to national railroad companies selling or abandoning rail tracks that were less profitable and had low density per mile. Much of this track was taken over by Class III carriers, also known as “short lines” (Miller & Stich, 2014). Short lines connect freight origins or destinations to Class I long-haul rail freight lines. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) report, the number of short line railroads has more than doubled since the Staggers Rail Act, from about 220 companies in 1980 to more than 540 in 2014 (FRA, 2014).====Although they operate at a relatively small scale compared to the nation's major long-haul freight railroads, short lines are crucial to economic activity and transport of goods as they are the linchpin of the railroad network, efficiently connecting many communities to the nation's mainline railroad system. Despite their economic significance and value to the freight transportation system, most short line rail companies struggle to be financially viable because their current revenues are not sufficient to overcome the backlog of deferred maintenance on their lines that had occurred under the mainline railroads' ownership (Sage, Casavant, & Eustice, 2015).====The sustainability of short line railroads depends on two areas of concern (Llorens & Richardson, 2014). The first concern is their ability to shift from 263-kip (263,000 pounds) loaded car weight to 286-kip loaded car weights, following the lead of Class I railroads. Short line railroads interchange with Class I railroads, and to remain viable short lines need to upgrade to handle heavier cars (Casavant & Tolliver, 2001). However, many short lines do not have the underlying track and structures capable of supporting these cars (LaDOTD, 2003). Carrying 286-kip cars on short lines with light rail and poor tie and/or ballast conditions poses a safety problem due to their increased vertical and lateral loading of the track, which may result in derailments even at low operating speeds, as explained in detail in Zarembski (2014). The second concern is their ability to receive funding for major rehabilitation projects. It is evident that these two concerns are interrelated and pose a unique dilemma for these rail carriers.====Therefore, in order to preserve the railroad system's network and operations, many states have programs that provide loans or grants for rehabilitation and improvement projects. State support programs for short lines can be categorized into four different forms (Qiao et al., 2016): (1) grant programs (2) loan programs, (3) loan/grant hybrid programs and (4) tax-based incentives and benefits. Federal support is also provided through Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program, 45G short line tax credit, and occasionally the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program (Ozbay et al., 2015, Miller & Stich, 2014). There are also some loan programs that allow for conversion to a grant if performance targets, such as jobs or local carloads, are achieved (Sperry & Morgan, 2013).====In New Jersey, the New Jersey Rail Freight Assistance Program, henceforth referred to as “rail grants program”, awards approximately $10 million annually in grants to freight rail operators for acquisition assistance, construction, rehabilitation and demonstration type projects. The purpose of this program is to promote and sustain economic development, as well as to maintain a balanced transportation system, where rail is used in lieu of trucks when economically viable. The review process for the selection of candidate projects for funding is made based on the information on each project, their cost estimates and the estimated value added to the state.====The financial viability of any state funded projects should be evaluated by identifying, estimating and comparing their costs and benefits. The ultimate goal is to allocate society's resources efficiently and ensure that any proposed project promises returns to society greater in value than its costs. To that end, the main objective of this paper is to review the NJ's rail grants program as a case study, identify the shortcomings of its evaluation process and provide recommendations for improving its project selection criteria and application ranking. The following tasks were conducted towards this objective: (1) the relevant literature and the available information on state funding programs were reviewed, (2) the historical project application data obtained from the NJDOT were analyzed, (3) interviews were conducted with industry experts, transportation agencies, railroad carriers, (4) a targeted survey of experts including rail grants evaluators and applicants was conducted and (5) an adjustment to the current review criteria and corresponding scores to improve the evaluation process was suggested.

However, India had the advantage of starting the reforms from a mixed economic system where the public sector enterprises (PSEs) dominated the “core” sectors of the economy including the airline industry while the private sector enterprises played an important role in the “non-core” industries. In contrast, China had to develop a market economic system from scratch (Chai & Roy, 2006). The share of PSEs in GDP in India was 25% in the early 1990s. Due to the strong resistance of vested interest groups including trade unions (Chai & Roy, 2006), a large part of the value of PSEs have not been privatised including the government owned Air India. However, the contribution of the private sector to GDP growth has been over 80% since the 2000s. When China began its privatisation in the 1980s, the share of the private sector was less than 1% of its GDP. Three decades later, the private sector has now contributed to 60% of the nation's GDP and 90% of the new jobs. Thus, the degree of privatisation in India has been much deeper and broader historically and currently.====In China, the government controls firms in almost all strategically important industries. The average state ownership in publicly listed companies was about 70% in 2002 and was still the case in 2017. In the case where the Chinese government is a minority shareholder in a privatised SOE, it still retains a control over the firm through appointing top managers and boards of directors (Xu & Wang, 1999). The heavy influence of Chinese government on listed companies was confirmed by a report by S&P Global Ratings in 2016 (Allirajan, 2016). The report finds that India's top 200 companies, particularly the private companies, outperform their Chinese peers in several financial indicators despite India's infrastructure bottlenecks. There is large difference in the size of the private sectors. The private firms account for 75% of the net debt and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of the 200 companies in India, while this figure is less than 20% for the top Chinese companies.====Air transport had long been regarded as a core industry that should be regulated and protected in China and India due to its significant national security and sovereignty implications in the history. As with other industries of the two countries, deregulation and privatisation in this sector began in the 1980s. However, up to now, China's aviation market is still dominated by state-owned carriers although all the major carriers have been partly privatised in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2016, Chinese carriers transported 436 million passengers with the “big three” state-owned airline groups, Air China, China Eastern and China Southern, commanding a market share of 24%, 22%, and 25%, respectively. Members of the Hainan Aviation Group (HNA), a de facto private airline group,==== held a market share of some 14%. The share of other private airlines in the passenger market was less than 16%. In contrast, the Indian market has now been dominated by private carriers with major private carriers such as Jet Airways, SpiceJet, IndiGo, Vistara, AirAsia India, and Go Air, carrying 82 million passengers, representing a market share of 79% in the 2015–16 financial year (Wang, Zhang, & Zhang, 2018). The market share of the government-owned carrier, Air India, was less than 15%. With such stunningly different governance structures in airline companies in the two countries, it is expected that the performance of airlines would be substantially different. Although research comparing the economic reforms and development between the two economies is voluminous, comparative studies into a particular industry remain rare. This research aims to fill the literature gap by investigating the efficiency performance of the airline companies in the two countries and exploring the likely determinants of the performance.====The findings of this study suggest that China's state-owned airlines are far less efficient than their Indian counterparts, in both the capacity generation stage and the service stage. Private ownership and the LCC business model are key to determine the airline efficiency performance. Next section briefly reviews the air transport sector in the two countries.

The differences between the two sources of efficiency are significant, allowing us to test how different regulations impact performance. We find that regional governments grant more efficient projects than those granted by central government, but we do not find significant differences in performance in relation to the public/private ownership share, following the privatization of publicly owned concessionaires or due to changes in price updating regulations (price cap). The motorways nationalized in the 1980s had lower persistent efficiency levels, while management seems to have had a limited role in promoting efficiency gains. Furthermore, our results support the existence of scale and density economies in Spain, showing that an increase in vehicle-kilometers is more important than extending the motorway.","Road transport, as a major means of transportation, has had a significant influence on all areas of economic, political and social development since earliest times. Indeed, its role in public infrastructure investment and its links with economic growth, productivity and employment have been extensively studied, most notably in the economics literature since Aschauer's seminal work (1989).==== Yet, very little is known about the efficiency and productivity of motorway management and the impact produced by specific public policies and reforms related to motorway ownership and regulation.====In some countries, motorway networks are managed directly by the State (or by a publicly owned corporation operating under private law), while in others, private companies manage motorways under concession contracts, a toll being charged as a return on their investment and to meet maintenance and operation costs. These Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contracts are designed and awarded in the expectation of improving efficiency and, above all, of facilitating private financing. However, toll regulation has typically been shown to be unrelated to the degree of productivity or the efficiency of concessionaires (Albalate, Bel, & Fageda, 2009), especially in the absence of price-cap regulation (Iossa, 2015), and satisfying uncertain demand in the long run is the main factor determining the outcome of the standard fixed-term concession contract (Engel, Fischer, & Galetovic, 1997a; 2001).==== Even if motorway managers appear to have little scope for improving their overall cost efficiency, given the overriding importance of capital costs (investment) in their cost structure, and “can do little to increase demand”, as Engel, Fischer and Galetovic (2002, p. 22) claim, the empirical literature remains scarce and overly limited to allow us to draw any general conclusions about efficient management in the sector and its determinants.====Clearly, regulators seek to increase the efficiency of service providers by implementing regulatory and policy changes. To this end, analyses of the efficiency of regulated industries, such as energy systems (Chen, Pestana, & Borges, 2015; Ghosh and Kathuria, 2016; Lin & Wang, 2014) and water services (Carvalho & Cunha-Marques, 2016; Phillips, 2013); transport services, including buses (Bel & Rosell, 2016; Vigren, 2016; Wegelin, 2018) and railroads (Couto & Graham, 2009); and transport infrastructures such as ports (Cullinane, Wang, Song, & Ji, 2006; Tongzon & Heng, 2005) and airports (Adler & Liebert, 2014; Martín & Voltes-Dorta, 2011), have figured among the most frequent applications of cost efficiency analysis using (stochastic) frontier models. Recently, such efficiency analyses have begun to distinguish between transient and persistent inefficiency, where the latter absorbs structural problems in the firm or systematic shortfalls in its management, and the former is a time-variant component that absorbs changes in a firm's efficiency. However, the empirical literature in general has failed to pay sufficient attention to the distinction between these two components of a firm's efficiency (Filippini & Greene, 2016). A number of recent analyses, focusing on energy efficiency (Filippini & Hunt, 2015), banking (Mamatzakis, Tsionas, Kumbhakar, & Koutsomanoli-Filippaki, 2015) and the nursing home sector (Di Giorgio, Filippini, & Masiero, 2015), nevertheless, emphasize the importance of distinguishing between these two types of efficiency and of measuring it accurately for policy analysis. Since most of the regulators use carrot-and-stick principles, they have to quantify the margin by which they have to increase their efficiency. Moreover, the literature dedicated to studying the efficiency of public utilities has largely neglected the motorway industry with just a few specific exceptions, most notably Benfratello, Iozzi and Valbonessi (2009) for Italy, and Odeck (2008a) and Welde and Odeck (2011) for Norway.====This paper extends this literature by drawing on a new, self-constructed dataset for Spain, the country with the largest number of private concessionaires (for-profit) and with a longstanding tradition of PPPs (Albalate, 2014). The Spanish experience is particularly insightful due to the lessons it can offer. Spanish motorway concessionaires have experienced periods of vigorous economic growth and financial distress, have had to adapt to a variety of regulatory reforms, and have undergone transitions from private to public management via the nationalization of bankrupt concessionaires and the privatization of publicly owned toll motorway companies. This variety of experience makes Spain an interesting case in which to evaluate how policy changes and reforms affect efficiency.====The dataset covers a time span of 26 years, from 1988 to 2015, and allows us to evaluate the efficiency of concessionaires during these distinct periods. Moreover, it means we can take into consideration regulatory changes (price cap schemes, privatizations, etc.) and the different features of motorways (length, network expansions, physical features, technological advances, etc.) that might have impacted on concessionaire cost efficiency. We analyze the effects of a variety of public policies and regulatory reforms on the efficiency of toll motorway companies by specifically reporting transient and persistent efficiency estimations. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature by undertaking a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate cost efficiency in the motorway sector distinguishing between time variant and invariant efficiency.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the extant literature examining the efficiency of motorways. In section 3, we outline our technical approach by presenting the model implemented.

Their expectations also involve non-linear relationships, hence a non-linear mathematical programming is utilized in the paper. The commercial payment, gross-cost and performance-based gross cost payment models are the alternatives to be considered instead of the net-cost model due to its service quality problems in Istanbul's context. According to the model results, a gross cost payment model is recommended for Istanbul. By offering a consensus-based middle ground between the transport actors, the model provides a way for improvement in public transport service provision especially for developing cities where regulatory and institutional context is hard to change.","Management and organization of public transport have been going through a reform in recent decades, both developed and developing countries joining this trend. A key focus is on providing public transport services in a cost-efficient manner and increasing service quality or effectiveness. Different ways to achieve these objectives have been proposed and implemented, including deregulation, privatization, competitive tendering and various forms of contracting, depending on the context (Hensher, Mulley, & Smith, 2013). Contractual practices can take different forms in the way regulatory powers are assigned by transport authorities, financing arrangements, the structure of ownership between public and private parties and the way the relationship is defined between transport operators and authorities (Pedro & Macário, 2016). Although contracting is the main trend in many cities, some of the developing cities still continue with concession-based models. Although these models are different from contracting or tendering based service procurement models, the problems are similar due to the similarity of the parties’ expectations.====Accommodating different objectives of the parties, whether they are commercial or social, requires taking a more holistic approach (Hensher & Macario, 2002). An overall public transport system should satisfy different needs and demands of the actors; passengers, authorities and operators. Whereas transport operators seek to maximize their revenues and profitability, passengers demand a high-quality service in terms of reliability, affordability, comfort and availability. Transport authorities, on the other hand, try to reduce the subsidies paid to the operators. Finding an optimal contractual type which can satisfy different parties’ demands has recently been an important problem in many countries (Hooper, 2008). Although there are different components of a contractual relation like contract area, duration, the selection mechanism (competitive tendering or negotiated contracts (Hensher and Wallis, 2005)); payment or remuneration model is an integral part of contractual relations between transport operators and authorities. The payment model can change the incentives of the parties by changing their risk allocations, hence leading to different performance outcomes. Net-cost, gross-cost, performance-based contracts, cost-plus and commercial payment models are commonly used in urban public transport sector as given in Table 1 (Wallis, 2005). This table presents the list of alternative payment models, with risk allocations and model descriptions. Other frameworks are also provided in the literature (Macario, 2008, pp. 109–144; Stanley & van de Velde, 2008). The selection of an optimal payment model is a complicated problem, the solution of which depends on the local setting.====One of the most important factors in a local setting is the regulatory context which influences the selection of optimal contractual payment model. In European Union (EU) countries, competitive tendering is promoted for public transport service procurement by EU Regulation 1370/2007 (van de Velde, 2008); however, there is not any such regulation in Turkey and public bus services are either directly provided by the local government through a municipal company or concessions are given to the private bus operators. The regulatory framework in EU provides incentives for operators to increase efficiency, reduce subsidies and increase service quality (Mouwen & van Ommeren, 2016). Different contract types prescribe different incentive schemes; therefore, lead to different performance outcomes (Margari, Erbetta, Petraglia, & Piacenza, 2007; Roy & Yvrande-Billon, 2007).====Istanbul presents a good case for the problem of selecting an optimal payment model, which will be examined in this study. Having a population of 14.8 million and 11.5 million daily public transport ridership, Istanbul is the most densely populated city of Turkey, and the economic, cultural and historic center of the country. However, rapid urban growth resulted in rapid increase in demand for local public transport. The problems in service quality have led to increase in car-ownership rates (currently, 180 per thousand people) (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2016). Istanbul has now the 6th worst traffic congestion problem according to global Tomtom Traffic Index (2017). These mobility problems turned the attention of the local authority, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM), to increase the service quality in public transport, particularly public bus services in a cost-efficient manner. Bus services are provided by the municipal public bus company, IETT, having 2,141 buses and through concessionary private bus services, OHO and OAS being two private bus operators, having a total of 2,963 buses. However, there are serious service quality problems including crowding, safety, unregulated competition on the road for passengers (Alpkokin, Black, & Canıtez, 2017). The concessionary or commercial payment model where the operators directly get the ticket revenues and assume cost risk is regarded by IMM as one of the major factors leading to low service quality. Although this payment model incentivizes the operators to increase the number of passengers they carry, given the high and captive passenger demand for bus services, it leads to crowding and comfort problems. This is because private operators try to carry as many passengers as possible per trip, acting only commercially to increase their profitability. The problem is aggravated given the inadequacy of a subsidy mechanism for uncommercial or social services and the lack of a service quality enforcement mechanism. Therefore, IMM tries to change the incentives of private operators by changing the payment model so that service quality is increased in a cost-efficient manner.====In this study, we propose a new payment model for the local authority of Istanbul and private bus operators by using a non-linear mathematical modelling approach. The model tries to find the optimal payment model alternative which optimizes the expectations of i) passengers demanding high service quality, ii) operators demanding high profitability and iii) local government or authority demanding low subsidies. The main contributions of this study include:====The rest of the study is organized as the following.

An accurate estimation of the market penetration rate of CATs is necessary to adequately prepare the infrastructure and ==== needed to support the technology. Building upon the theory of ====, we develop Bass models for various freight transportation innovations, including improved tractor and trailer aerodynamics, and anti-idling technologies for trucks. The proposed model accounts for heterogeneity between organizations by using a modified Bass model to vary parameters within a designated range for each of the potentially adopting organizations. The results of the paper are Bass models for existing freight organization innovation adoption and estimates of multiple scenarios of CAT adoption over time by freight organizations within the case study region of Shelby County, Tennessee and provide a foundation for ","Many signs point to driverless vehicles joining the fleet within the next ten years. Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to revolutionize transportation, and there has been significant research and development on the operational side of making automated vehicles a reality. However, there are a number of other barriers to overcome before widespread adoption is possible (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). Safety concerns, legality and liability questions, security/privacy matters, and infrastructure changes must be identified and addressed before autonomous technology reaches maturity (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Kockelman et al., 2017). In order for policymakers to make informed decisions about these issues, it is essential to have an estimate of the market penetration rate of CAVs.====The freight transportation industry stands to benefit from integrating connected autonomous vehicle technology. One benefit would be a reduction in collisions, which translates to safer working conditions, increased profits, and reliability (Anderson et al., 2014; Bagloee, Tavana, Asadi, & Oliver, 2016). Of arguably greater interest to freight organizations, connected autonomous trucks (CATs) are predicted to increase fuel efficiency, reducing consumption by up to 10–15% (Anderson et al., 2014; Bagloee et al., 2016; Bullis, 2011; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Huang & Kockelman, 2018; Kockelman et al., 2017). Integrating CATs into the fleet would also reduce the labor required to move goods, further reducing the cost of operations. Freight organizations are already attempting to address a shortage of drivers, and CATs may be the solution to the labor shortage (Rossman, 2017). The highest costs associated with long-distance trucking are driver salary and fuel costs, and CATs have the potential to greatly reduce both of these costs (Shankwitz, 2017). Reducing the manpower required to operate the vehicles may also allow organizations to be more productive, because laws that regulate the number of hours a driver may legally travel might not apply to driverless vehicles.====However, it is difficult to predict how policymakers will react to autonomous freight vehicles. Unlike individual CAVs, state and federal DOTs have not yet released significant regulations or guides for integrating CATs into the freight industry (Hook, 2017). In addition, organizations exhibit significant heterogeneity, and so their adoption behavior is challenging to anticipate (Frambach & Schillewaert, 2002; Ryan & Tucker, 2012). Without sufficient data on autonomous freight adoption, it is difficult to identify and address the various infrastructure, policy, and logistical changes that will need to be made as freight organizations switch to automation. It is, therefore, critical to develop a model to estimate the adoption rate of CATs for freight organizations.====One of the most widely recognized methods for explaining the rate of innovation adoption is the theory of diffusion of innovations (Mahajan, Muller, & Bass, 1991; Rogers, 2003). Diffusion of innovations studies often focus on individual adoption rather than organizational adoption, or only discuss organizational adoption in a generalized manner. Most studies for organizational innovation adoption focus on attempting to identify characteristics of organizations that promote adoption (Damanpour, 1991; Hoerup, 2001; Kim & Srivastava, 1998; Moch & Morse, 1977; Pierce & Delbecq, 1977; Rogers, 2003; Subramanian & Nilakanta, 1996) or investigate the process of adoption within an organization (Alessandrini, Delle Site, Gatta, Marcucci, & Zhang, 2016, Eveland, 1979; Fidler & Johnson, 1984; Leonard-Barton & Deschamps, 1988; Marcucci & Gatta, 2016 Meyer & Goes, 1988; Rogers, 2003, Talebian & Mishra, 2018; Valeri et al., 2016). This pattern holds true for CAT adoption predictions. While there have been studies that predict the market penetration rate of CAVs for individuals (Bansal, Kockelman, & Singh, 2016; Bansal & Kockelman, 2017; Lavasani, Jin, & Du, 2016; Perrine, Kockelman, & Huang, 2018; Quarles & Kockelman, 2018), the issue of CATs and the freight industry has received little attention from academia. The literature only briefly mentions CATs in freight transportation (Catapult Transport Systems, 2017; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Kockelman et al., 2017) or focuses on the costs and benefits of implementing CATs for freight without approaching the question of demand (Csiszár & Földes, 2018; Flämig, 2016; Kunze, Ramakers, Henning, & Jeschke, 2011; Rossman, 2017; Shankwitz, 2017). In addition, the data available to form a predictive model for organizations is lacking. There is speculation on the potential benefits and drawbacks of organizational CAT adoption (Anderson et al., 2014; Bagloee et al., 2016; Bullis, 2011; Kockelman et al., 2017; Rossman, 2017; Shankwitz, 2017), but without some of the basic information such as willingness to pay (WTP), organizational structure, strength of inter-organizational communication, upkeep and maintenance costs for CATs, and differences between consumer and both public and private corporate innovation behavior, it is very difficult to obtain accurate predictions regarding the adoption of innovations by organizations (Damanpour, 1991; Frambach & Schillewaert, 2002; Kim & Srivastava, 1998; Moch & Morse, 1977; Palmer, Tate, Wadud, & Nellthorp, 2018). Research is needed in the area of predictive analysis regarding the potential market penetration rate of CATs in freight organizations.====This paper uses diffusion of innovations theory to provide an estimation of the future adoption rate of CATs in freight industries. A modified version of Bass model is used to account for heterogeneity between organizations. Due to the lack of currently available data, a number of reasonable assumptions are made regarding organizational innovation adoption behavior in order to better understand how the various factors influencing the adoption of CATs may interact. Applicability of the developed model is shown with a dataset containing all freight organizations within Shelby County, the largest county both in terms of population and geographic area in the State of Tennessee, and a center for both air and ground freight transportation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The following section outlines the process for modeling the adoption rate of CATs by freight organizations.

However, most of them are silent on whether the impact varies across different housing submarkets. In some contexts like China, compared with high-end counterparts, low-end housing purchasers, generally, have lower income and thus lower car availability (and transportation mobility). As such, they may prefer and attach a higher value to living in the proximity of basic public services (which are essential to life, such as transit). This is likely to be applicable to contexts where purchasing and/or using cars are not fully affordable for low-income households. We use 22,586 second-hand housing data in Xiamen (China) to assess the differential price impacts of access to basic public services in low and high-end submarkets. Results from two-sample two-tailed ====-tests and ====-tests and hedonic modeling confirm several findings: (1) there are systematic differences between access to basic public services in low- and high-end properties; (2) the two housing submarkets do not follow the same pricing mechanism; (3) access to transit, commercial centers, shopping centers, and sports and cultural centers has positive and significant price impacts in the low-end housing submarket. Yet, this is not the case in the high-end counterpart; (4) the effect of access to basic public services on housing price varies across the two submarkets: typically, access to basic public services has a larger positive price impact on low-end properties than on high-end ones; (5) interestingly, access to shopping centers has a larger price impact in the high-end housing submarket than in the low-end. The findings of this study basically support our hypothesis and also benefit policy prescription. As such, practical implications of the findings are discussed finally. Notably, our argument is that low-end properties buyers are more willing to pay for access to “basic” public services rather than that to premium/high-quality services. By contrast, based on scattered evidence from this study and existing literature, we suspect, though definitely cannot conclude, that high-end properties buyers have a predilection for premium/high-quality amenities, such as natural beauty and prestigious schools.","Public services can exert positive, marginal (insignificant), or negative externalities on adjacent properties (refer to Section 2). Externalities of public services can be reflected by property price (or whether or not housing purchasers are willing to pay extra to live close to public services). Generally, public services (e.g., transit service and commercial center) act as amenities and exert positive externalities to properties located within their surrounding areas, thereby increasing nearby housing price. Accordingly, residents have a notable willingness to pay for access to public services. Relationships between access to public services and housing price have attracted great scholarly attention over the years. Most of related studies have confirmed capitalization effects of various public services, such as transit (Bocarejo, Portilla, & Pérez, 2013), school (Black, 1999), shopping center (Li & Brown, 1980), hospital (Huh & Kwak, 1997), and green space (Kong, Yin, & Nakagoshi, 2007).====However, different purchasers may value housing characteristics or attributes in varying ways (Hui, Zhong, & Yu, 2016; Mak, Choy, & Ho, 2010; Song & Quercia, 2008; Wen, Xiao, & Hui, 2019). More specifically, characteristics of housing are not valued similarly in different submarkets. In this regard, access to basic public services, a property characteristic, is by no means an exception. In some contexts like China, typically, low-end (or low-priced) houses target income-constrained residents, who have low car availability (Banister, 2005) and make high proportions of trips by walking, cycling, and transit (Debrezion, Pels, & Rietveld, 2007; Venter, Vokolkova, & Michalek, 2007). Therefore, space is more likely to be a constraint for residents without cars, and therefore, access (or physical proximity) to basic public services (which are part and parcel of life, such as transit) is presumably favored by this category of housing purchasers. In other words, for life convenience (Szeto, Yang, Wong, Li, & Wong, 2017), low-end housing purchasers may prefer and attach a high value to living in the proximity of basic public services. In comparison, high-end (or high-priced) houses cater to the wealthy, who are likely to have high incomes to afford a car (i.e., high car availability) (Zhao, 2011). Thus, they mostly rely on cars to overcome distance for travel and to render the space obsolete, so living in the proximity of basic public services (e.g., transit) may be less important to them than to income-constrained residents (Zhang & Yi, 2017). Therefore, in theory, the difference in the willingness to pay for access to basic public services by the two purchaser categories is expected. Based on the above reasoning, we propose a testable or refutable hypothesis: low-end property purchasers are more willing to pay for access to basic public services than high-end ones. Note that basic public services concerned in this study include transit, shopping centers, educational facilities, hospitals, and sports and cultural centers (====). Moreover, the hypothesis cannot be applied everywhere and is unlikely to hold in car-dominated, developed contexts (e.g., the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia) where purchasing and using cars is cheap and people with limited income still can afford cars.====As noted, numerous existing studies teased out the association between access to public services and property price and suggested that access to public services affects housing price. These studies assume that the effect of the access is constant on low - and high-end housing and can readily answer the question of “====” However, most of them are silent on whether the effect varies in different submarkets, such as low- and high-end submarkets. In other words, they cannot answer another question: “====”====A better understanding of the varying capitalization effects of public services helps developers and property purchasers make more reasonable and informed decisions, and it also assists governments to design or craft evidence-based policy measures (e.g., value capture schemes and alleviating negative externalities of some kinds of public services, such as large-scale hospitals). There are, however, few investigations devoted to supporting or dismissing the varying capitalization effects of access to public services in different submarkets, particularly in the context of China (an under-studied location). China is a populous developing country where high-income residents preferentially use cars and low-income counterparts are unlikely to own a car (Zhao, 2011). As such, a Chinese city (Xiamen) is chosen for hypothesis testing. In light of this, we collected housing price data in Xiamen and employed both hedonic pricing models (HPMs) and spatial econometric models to empirically assess and compare the effects of access to basic public services in varying submarkets. We found that access to basic public services is valued differently in low- and high-end housing submarkets, or more specifically, that low-end housing purchasers are more willing to pay for access to basic public services. The contributions of this paper include the following: ====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.

Twenty-nine short line railroads operate in Georgia, six of which operate either partially or totally over 596 miles of rail track that the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) owns. Based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Input-Output Modelling System (RIMS II) backward-linkage model, this study estimates the economic impacts associated with short line railroad revenues and with GDOT infrastructure spending on these six short line systems under different sets of assumptions. Among the economic impacts, and depending on the assumptions, the study finds that cumulatively, the six systems increase annual output in the range of $2.8 - $14.5 million, increase annual earnings in the range of $0.7 - $4.1 million, generate annual value-added in the range of $1.4 - $7.5 million, and annually add 10–93 jobs on average.","Freight railroads are a vital component of the U.S. transportation network. In 2012, there were 575 freight railroads with 138,524 freight mileage, directly employing 181,264 persons, with an average compensation (wages and benefits) worth $109,570.==== According to the American Association of Railroads (AAR), freight railroad traffic at the origin accounted for 1.76 billion tons and 28.7 million carloads.==== Top commodities shipped in 2012 were coal (750.2 million tons), chemicals (152.8 million tons), and farm products (134.5 million tons). The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates for-hire rail transportation services accounted for 43.9 billion of GDP in 2013 (current dollars).====National and state freight rail networks include Class I, II, and III railroads, most commonly classified by revenue. The most recent definition of Class I, II, and III carriers from the Surface Transportation Board (STB) defined Class I carriers as having annual revenues equal to $467.1 million or more, Class II (‘regional’) carriers with revenues between $37.4 and $467.1 million, and Class III carriers as having less than $37.4 million. Regardless of revenues, the STB defines all switching and terminal carriers as Class III (‘short line’) carriers.====Class I railroads form the backbone of the U.S. freight rail network. In 2016, there were 93,339 miles of track servicing Class I railroads, accounting for 74% of total rail freight mileage.==== To supply rail services to shippers, Class I rails in 2016 employed 26,716 locomotives and 315,227 freight cars, with a 1021-mile average length of haul.==== The Association of American Railroads (AAR) estimates that railroads shipped 1.59 trillion ton-miles in 2016, 44.9% of total ton-miles shipped. Average revenue per ton-mile was 3.99 cents (current dollars) in 2016.====Railroads below the Class II threshold, as well as switching and terminal carriers, are “short line” railroads (SLRs) that often operate in rural communities and serve as feeder carriers that link to the Class I carrier network.==== SLRs are individually small in extent. Based on 2014 AAR data, Table 1 reports that Class II and Class III railroads accounted for 98.7% of the total number of railroads, operating in every state except Hawaii, but accounted for a much smaller 31.2% of miles operated. Further, Class II and III railroads accounted for only 9.8% of freight railroad employees and 5.6% generated ($4.0 billion) in total revenues.====From Table 2, Class III railroads represent 84% of total Class II and Class III miles. Class III railroads average 108 miles operated per railroad, much smaller than the 701-average operated per Class II regional railroad.====Short line railroads complement Class I railroads, consolidating shipments and providing the first mile and the last mile of service for one in five rail cars (American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association, 2017). As many SLR systems serve rural communities, they can provide more efficient transportation alternatives to shippers as well as a broader economic impact on the communities which these systems serve. Short line railroads also benefit local communities by increasing local business volume, reducing highway maintenance and user costs, and increasing economic development opportunities.====Babcock, Russell, Prater, and Morrill (1993), Allen, Sussman, and Miller (2002) and Johnson, McClure, Schneider, and Wood (2004) document the evolution and growth of the U.S. short line industry and discusses the ownership problems that the industry faces. A 1993 FRA study finds that Class II and Class III operators have difficulty accessing capital markets, and they are generally not able to meet funding requirements to obtain needed loans for maintenance or system upgrades (FRA, 1993, Page 27–29). During this same period, the market structure of Class II and Class III systems changed with the rise of railroad holding companies. A consequence of market consolidation was greater access to private capital markets as the consolidated companies were better able to meet the funding requirements of private sector financial institutions. This further spurred the growth of holding companies, the largest of which is Genesee & Wyoming Inc., which controls more than 100 railroads. Between 1996 and 2012, railroad holding companies increased from 14 to 27 and the number of small railroads controlled by holding companies increased from just over 100 to nearly 270. More recently, this number has dropped to just under 250 small railroads.====SLRs are critical to Georgia's transportation infrastructure and support the efficient movement of goods into and out of the State. The State of Georgia rail network currently includes 4643 route miles. Two of the 31 freight railroads in Georgia, CSX and Norfolk Southern, are Class I railroads and together own 3631 route miles, 78% of the total rail mileage in the State. Since Georgia has no Class II railroads, the remaining 1362 route miles are SLRs. Of the 29 SLRs, Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) owns 44% of the mileage (596 miles) over which six short line railroads operate. During the six-year period from 2010 to 2015, these six short line rail railroads handled 60,032 carloads, generated $28.73 million in revenues, and diverted 596,960 truckloads from the highways (GDOT, 2016).====This study contributes to the literature in three distinct ways. First, the study provides a thorough review of the literature related to short line railroads. Second, the study uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) RIMS II backward-linkage model to estimate the economic impacts of six short line railroads that use Georgia owned track. And third, the analysis estimates economic impacts under alternatives sets of assumptions. Rather than a point estimate of the economic impact that is dependent on a specific set of assumptions, this approach provides lower and upper bounds that reflect the inherent uncertainty associated with economic impact assessments.",Economic impact analysis of GDOT short line railroad infrastructure investment in Georgia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885918301574,11 June 2019,2019,Research Article,330.0

This conventional valuation approach has been criticized for not valuing positive and negative impacts of transport projects in relation to each other and for not valuing such impacts in a public context, but in the context of private decisions. These critiques might be circumvented through valuing transport projects in a ","Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a widely applied tool for the appraisal of transport projects (e.g. Asplund & Eliasson, 2016; Mackie, Worsley, & Eliasson, 2014; Sager, 2013; Saraç-Lesavre, 2014; Thomopoulos, Grant-Muller, & Tight, 2009; Welde & Odeck, 2011). Generally, the most dominant benefit in a CBA for road projects is travel time savings. Mackie, Jara-Díaz, and Fowkes (2001) observe that, in the United Kingdom, travel time savings have accounted for around 80% of the benefits in CBAs for major road schemes, while Eliasson and Lundberg (2012) show that 90% of the benefits in the Swedish Transport Investment Plan 2010–2021 consist of reduced travel times and transport costs. On the other hand, although the environmental impacts of transport projects are recognized as items to be internalized in a CBA, their consideration has been hampered by difficulties in establishing the monetary value of a unit of environmental impact (Daniels & Hensher, 2000; Ivehammar, 2008, 2014).====One of the main criticisms of CBA is that, while it considers the non-monetized impacts of projects on objectives such as preserving landscapes and biodiversity, these effects are examined only in a qualitative manner (e.g. Lamari, Prévost, & Poulin-Lariviere, 2014; Mackie et al., 2014; Mouter, Annema, & Van Wee, 2015). Hence, they are not included in either of the indicators that are often decisive in the political process and the media: the benefit-cost ratio and the net present value (e.g. Annema & Koopmans, 2015). Based on an analysis of 67 CBAs performed in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2011, Annema and Koopmans (2015) conclude that in many cases relevant environmental effects are omitted or not monetized in the CBA. Moreover, they observe that non-monetized effects are often excluded from CBA conclusions. Mouter et al. (2015) establish that a result of the relatively weak position of effects that are difficult to monetize is that these can be underweighted in the decision-making process. Carson (2012) argues that, without knowing the monetary values of environmental externalities, infrastructure planners must make valuations arbitrarily. In some cases, this results in the assignment of infinitely high values, while in others it can produce a value of zero, possibly leading to the ‘wrong’ decisions being made. Nash, Preston, and Hopkinson (1991) argue that the procedure of computing a net present value which includes a monetary valuation of time and accident savings but excludes all environmental effects is seriously misleading.====Ackerman and Heinzerling (2004) assert that the weak position of environmental impacts in CBA might be rooted in the valuation approach adopted in the dominant style of CBA. Their primary critique is that a CBA does not value positive and negative impacts of a government project in relation to each other as the CBA is built on the Kaldor-Hicks efficiency criteria (e.g. Boadway, 2006), which prescribe that the value winners attach to a project's benefits are evaluated separately from the value losers attach to their losses. More specifically, the Kaldor-Hicks efficiency criteria evaluate costs and benefits of a proposed project through measuring the monetary equivalent of a project's impact(s) on the individuals' welfare (either the individuals' compensating variation or equivalent variation). Subsequently, those projects where the sum of monetary gains outweigh the sum of monetary losses are recommended under the condition that the winners are still better off after compensating the losers. Importantly, winners and losers are not asked to judge whether the overall gains of a project legitimate its costs or to assess the entire impact of different alternatives of a project on society.====A second critique on the valuation approach adopted in conventional CBAs is that the impacts of government projects are evaluated in a non-representative context (e.g. Ackerman & Heinzerling, 2004; Sen, 1995, 2000). In a conventional CBA, the value individuals attach to a ==== is generally inferred from the value they attach to this impact in the context of a ====. For example, impacts of government projects on landscape, nature and noise pollution are evaluated through investigating the private decisions people make when buying a house (e.g. Allen, Austin, & Swaleheen, 2015; Seo, Golub, & Kuby, 2014). One reason why private choices may not reflect how individuals want public policies to change is that private preferences can be distorted through collective action problems (e.g. Hestermann, Le Yaouanq, & Treich, 2018; Lusk & Norwood, 2011; Sen, 1995, 2000). For instance, people may not be willing to contribute individually because the impact of their individual contribution is negligible, but people may be willing to contribute when the whole community is forced to contribute through a new law or a government project because the impact of this coordinated contribution can be substantial (Lusk & Norwood, 2011; Sen, 1995). For example, Californians voted overwhelmingly in support of a ballot prohibiting battery-produced eggs, which at the time of the vote were the most popular type of eggs purchased and consumed in California (Lusk & Norwood, 2011). Hestermann et al. (2018) argue that a first reason why individuals' voting decisions differed from their aggregate decisions in the grocery store is that individuals have the opportunity to coordinate their actions in a voting context. An alternative explanation is that individuals value the same impact, in this case animal welfare, differently in a private sphere (grocery store) and a public sphere (ballot box). The idea that individuals can entertain different kinds of valuations in different spheres is, amongst others, covered in the contributions of Sunstein (1993) and Anderson (1993). For instance, Sunstein (1993, p. 784) states: “distinctions among kinds of valuation are highly sensitive to the particular setting in which they operate. People do not value goods acontextually. In one setting – say, the workplace – the prevailing kinds of valuation might be quite different from what they are elsewhere – say, the home or the ballot box.” Furthermore, Sunstein (1993) argues that because of the highly contextual nature of choice it is incorrect to assume that an individuals' private choices can be simply adaptable for policy use.====In sum, various scholars argue that crucial considerations might be lost in conventional CBAs, which results in recommendations that are not in line with the general public's actual preferences. These scholars argue that this critique can be circumvented through valuing government projects in a social choice context in which overall burdens and benefits of proposed government projects are considered together in a public – rather than private – context (e.g. Ackerman & Heinzerling, 2004). Essentially, a social choice approach (also coined by Ackerman and Heinzerling as ‘holistic valuation’) requires that individuals evaluate positive and negative impacts for the entire community in relation to each other in the context of a government decision. Scholars suggest that social choice-based valuation of positive and negative impacts of government projects will produce different outcomes than conventional valuation studies (also coined by Ackerman and Heinzerling as ‘atomistic’). However, to our knowledge, this statement is primarily substantiated with thought experiments and anecdotal evidence; our field currently lacks empirical evidence comparing these two approaches.====This study aims to scrutinize this knowledge gap. To do so, we conducted four social choice valuation experiments in which respondents simultaneously evaluated the burdens and benefits of a transport project in the context of a decision of the Dutch government. To find out whether social choice valuation produce different outcomes than a conventional valuation approach, we compared the results inferred from our social choice experiments with the values enumerated in Dutch CBA guidelines (Rijkswaterstaat, 2018), as the studies on which these values are based (e.g. CE Delft, 2017; Kouwenhoven et al., 2014) meet the two criteria of a conventional valuation study: 1) positive and negative impacts of transport projects (such as travel time savings and environmental attributes) are not valued in relation to each other; 2) impacts are not valued in a public context, but in the context of private decisions. For instance, the values for noise pollution are derived based on an international meta-analysis of stated preference studies in which respondents were asked to trade-off private income and transportation noise nuisance in a private context (Bristow, Wardman, & Chintakayala, 2015) and the Dutch Value of Travel Time Savings is based on hypothetical route choice experiments in which respondents are asked to make a series of private choices between routes which differ in terms of travel time and travel costs (Kouwenhoven et al., 2014). A benefit of using the Dutch context is that several values prescribed in the CBA Guidelines (e.g. value of time and value of noise pollution) have been recently updated.====Because the arguments employed in the literature particularly focus on the evaluation of environmental impacts of transport projects, respondents participating in the choice experiments were asked to choose between different alternatives for a new public road connecting two municipalities which differed in terms of three environmental attributes: 1) Number of households experiencing noise pollution from traffic; 2) Remaining useable recreational area for 10,000 citizens; and 3) Number of hedgehogs living in a nature area in 2026. Furthermore, since scholars argue that social choice valuation might illuminate essential values that are lost in conventional studies, we asked respondents to provide qualitative motivations for their choices. This allowed us to identify considerations employed in social choice settings that respondents could not consider in conventional settings. Moreover, the qualitative data also enabled us to learn more about the perspective(s) individuals take when choosing between (impacts of) transport projects in a social choice setting.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the literature that is relevant for this study. Section 3 discusses our methodology. Sections 4 Data collection, 5 Results describe the data collection and the results.

With higher fares the operator has more resources to provide a better service, while demand in turn depends on both service quality and fare leading therefore to the question as to whether there is an optimal fare for different city scales. The model builds on the work of Daganzo (2010) who determines optimal network headway, stop spacing as well as the ratio of a central dense service area compared to the whole city size. In contrast to Daganzo we include fare and demand elasticity. With this it is possible to obtain some general insights for a range of cities on what type of fare levels are favorable. We focus on a flat fare structure, finding that from the viewpoint of maximizing social welfare, lower fares are preferable. If the operator cost coverage ratio is considered as objective function then there exists an optimal fare above the minimum fare. We illustrate the possible existence of critical fare points, at which the demand and service quality of public transport suddenly drop if an attractive alternative mode exists. We discuss further the impact of city size and demand density on optimal fares and service quality.","Prices for public transport vary significantly across different parts of the world. Fare increases are often a complex political issue as the prices are in many cases at least to some degree regulated. Providing affordable public transport is associated with a very wide range of issues, including urban development, congestion regulation, environmental issues as well as general ideas of fairness and providing a basic mobility level for all. Whereas in many developing countries the fare is kept low in order to allow people with a diverse financial background to afford it, in other countries the idea that public transport users should pay for the costs their travel creates leads to significantly higher prices. Furthermore, higher fares are often justified with the argument that it allows providing a better service. Due to these issues and different objectives in general there appears to be little agreement as to what fares are appropriate or optimal. A recent report by the European Metropolitan Transport Authorities also describe that the definition of “fair fares” varies across cities and transport authorities (EMTA, 2016). Whereas some cities consider highly differentiated fares (by distance, user group and/or time) as fair, others consider simple fare structures as fair. Even taking the fare structure dimension out, different flat fares can though lead to different modal shares that might be perceived as fair or optimal. A good, expensive public transport service can lead to being used and endorsed by some, whereas a low fare, low quality transport service might be used but not liked by the population. Hensher, Stopher, and Bullock (2003) discuss the complexity in quantifying the service quality, showing that fare is clearly an important aspect of user satisfaction with public transport but that willingness to pay will clearly depend on speed, seat availability and expected waiting time. This raises further the question as to how much public subsidy is justified to spend on public transport.====The objective of this paper is to contribute to this discussion by showing how fares, at least under a number of simplifying assumptions, would lead to different service quality levels and with it different demand levels. We consider that the answer to this will to a large part depend on the city parameters. We aim to provide some guidance as to what fares, service quality and demand levels can be derived in a range of cities. More specifically, as input city parameters, we vary size, population density and the demand level. Building on the work of Daganzo (2010), the variables that we optimize are network headway, stop spacing as well as the ratio of a central dense PT service area compared to the whole city size. These variables together with the fare level and the demand, which we presume to be elastic, interact and provide us with indices of social welfare and subsidy needed for the operator.====In contrast to bi-level solution approaches based on specific networks, continuous approximation approaches as in Daganzo (2010) describe the network on a more aggregate level through its key characteristics. This is a drawback as well as an advantage. Using this approach can avoid artefacts created by network details and instead provide general insights.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In the next section, existing literature is reviewed and in Section 3, the equations used in the model are explained. Section 4 compares the sensitivities of the optima regarding the decision variable boundaries and input variables, to observe how the differences are interrelated. Finally, Section 5 will conclude and discuss further work directions.","On the interaction between public transport demand, service quality and fare for social welfare optimisation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885918301604,6 June 2019,2019,Research Article,333.0

For reducing the complication of analysis, previous studies adopted the constant ====-====-","In recent years, various models have been developed to study the dynamics of rush-hour traffic congestion. Most of them have employed the basic bottleneck model (Vickrey, 1969), and made vast specific extensions (e.g., Hendrickson and Kocur (1981); Yang and Huang (1997); O'Dea (1999); Button (2004); de Palma, Lindsey, and Quinet (2004); Li, Lam, and Wong (2014); Xiao, Huang, and Liu (2015); Liu, Zhang, and Yang (2017)). In these studies, the dynamic process of congestion was analyzed in a tractable form, being possible due to the use of “point bottleneck” assumption.====In various “point bottleneck” models, however, the volume of traffic flow does not drop under heavily congested conditions because of the use of fixed bottleneck capacity. For example, the so-called “hypercongestion” which refers to a traffic jam situation where traffic flow is inversely related to density, cannot be explicitly revealed by these models. In fact, the analysis of data for downtown neighborhoods in large cities provides strong support for the existence of hypercongestion (Small and Chu (2003); Geroliminis and Daganzo (2008); Fosgerau and Small (2013); Fosgerau (2015); Liu, Yin, and Yang (2015); Liu and Geroliminis (2016)) and some relevant researches regarding hypercongestion and capacity drops are analyzed.====To capture the features of traffic in heavily congested downtown areas, some researchers have presented a new economic model, namely bathtub model, which is particularly well suited to study hypercongestion (e.g., Arnott (2013); Arnott, Kokoza, and Naji (2016); Arnott and Buli (2018)). The basic correspondences between traffic flow and water flow are as follows: water flowing into the bathtub corresponds to cars entering the traffic stream, water flowing out of the bathtub to cars exiting from it, and the height of water in the bathtub to traffic density. The bathtub model has such a property that the outflow is positively related to the water's height up to a critical level (normal congested), above which outflow is negatively related to the water's height (hypercongested). Therefore, the multimodal transport (e.g. Zhang, Lindsey, and Yang (2016); Wang et al. (2017); Zhang, Zheng, Yang, and Geroliminis (2018)) is not considered in the bathtub model.====In various existing bathtub models, a simplified scheduling preference is commonly adopted. The preference is formulated by a piecewise constant unit cost of the schedule delay and known as ==== preference, it destroys the continuity of UE inflow rate at the desired arrival time and neglects the continuity of scheduling preferences. In Arnott and Buli (2018), a computational solution of equilibrium with smooth preferences was obtained, however, as the intractability of the basic bathtub model, analytical results are not exhibited for both UE and SO states.====In this study, we attempt to investigate the detailed influences of continuous scheduling preference on bathtub congestion with a specific bathtub model developed by Arnott (2013). So far, researchers have developed several forms of scheduling preference according to different assumptions (for example, Small (1982); Hjorth, Börjesson, Engelson, and Fosgerau (2015); Abegaz, Hjorth, and Rich (2017); Li and Huang (2018)). As pointed out by Hjorth et al. (2015), the constant-affine scheduling formulation performs rather well. It is either the best scheduling preference, or has similar fit as the best one. Therefore, in this paper we employ this scheduling preference with a special design on the slopes of the linear penalty function's two parts (see Fig. 1). As late arrival is more expensive than early arrival, we let the late part of the function have a larger slope than the early part, which means the unit cost of per late arrival time is bigger than the unit cost of per early arrival time. Then, the scheduling formation becomes continuous and is herein referred to as continuous scheduling preference (CSP).====Section 2 presents the basic settings of the bathtub model with CSP. Sections 3 The no-toll equilibrium, 4 The social optimum investigate the no-toll user equilibrium (UE) and social optimum (SO).

First, according to the human capital theory, people invest in job searching until the marginal gain from an additional search equals the marginal cost of it. Since longer distance between home and workplace is associated with larger traveling and psychological costs, women are less likely to invest in job searches when possible jobs are located far from home, and hence are less likely to find a job (Johnson, 2006; Pries & Rogerson, 2009).====Second, commuting time and monetary costs commensurate with distance between the home and workplace, and it is well known that these commuting costs alter workers’ preferences and budget constraints, leading to an increase in reservation wage. With these fixed costs of work and an increase in reservation wage, people are less likely to participate in the labor market (==== Cogan, 1981; ==== Blundell & MaCurdy, 1999).====The third reason is particularly related to women. Several studies have found that household responsibilities are generally carried out by women (Aguiar & Hurst, 2007; Gimenez-Nadal & Sevilla, 2012) and hence women are more constrained in travel for work (England, 1993; Erickson, 1977; Hanson & Pratt, 1995; Madden, 1977; Madden & Michelle, 1980; Wheatley, 2013). Because women play a dual role as a market worker and a home production worker, they tend to participate in the labor market less when the distance to the workplace is longer. Recently, Black, Kolesnikova, and Taylor (2014) present a very large variation in the labor force participation rate of married women across US cities. They show that the labor force participation rates of married women are negatively correlated with metropolitan area commuting time that may arise from different traffic infrastructures across geographic regions.====Another important observation for female labor force participation made by Blau and Kahn (2000), Blau, Farber, and Winkler (2002) and Juhn and Potter (2006) is that the growth rate of the female labor force participation in the US had slowed down until the mid-1990s and reached a plateau in the 2000s. This phenomenon may indicate a possibility that the US labor market has achieved a ‘‘natural rate’’ of female labor force participation. If there is such thing as a natural rate of female labor force participation, Goldin (2006) suggests that it is likely to be influenced by the age structure of females. In addition, the natural rate of aggregate labor force participation can be thought of as a weighted average of natural rates of labor force participation of regions in a country. If the regional labor force participation rates are affected by average commuting costs as suggested by Black et al. (2014), it is important to examine the differences in traffic infrastructures across regions to explain the differences in natural rates of regional labor force participation.====In this context, this paper attempts to estimate the effect of subways on the female labor force participation rate in a region. Introduction of subways significantly reduces commuting time and costs and may allow women to balance work and house duties more easily because subways provide ==== within a city. Therefore, we expect the labor force participation rate of females to rise in that city. As Berechman and Paaswell (2001) and Kawabata (2003) point out, better job-access by public transit increases the probability of working and the number of hours worked for individuals who do not own a car. As of 2005 in Daejeon, Korea, which is our research area, only about 35% of female workers used cars to work. Therefore, we expect the female labor force participation in Daejeon to rise after public transportation like subways are available. For our analysis, we choose Daejeon Metropolitan City in Korea as a case study because there is to date only a single subway line constructed in that city. In other metropolitan areas in Korea, multiple subway lines exist, rendering it more difficult to pinpoint the effect of introducing a subway system on the female labor force participation.====In order to estimate the labor force participation effects of subways for females in Daejeon, we use difference-in–difference (DID) methods. We select carefully, as a comparison group, other provinces or metropolitan cities where there were no major public transits including subways constructed during the period of analysis. We examine the labor force participation rates and employment of females for the period 2005–2009, which includes the construction and expansion of the subway in Daejeon. Because our time span of analysis is relatively short (maximum 48 months), we can possibly rule out other factors that may influence labor force participation of females.====Our results show that the construction of the subway line in Daejeon has a positive effect on the female labor force participation rate. DID estimates suggest that by the time the subway line in Daejeon was fully completed, the female labor force participation rate increased by about 1.5 percentage points. In terms of employment growth, the largest effect of the subway is observed for women aged 50–59 (a 25% increase), followed by women aged 60 or over (a 12% increase). Therefore, subways appear to help older women to find jobs in Daejeon. On the other hand, the subway in Daejeon only slightly helped increase the employment of younger females.====Our findings also have important implications not only for developing countries but also for developed countries. For developing countries, a majority of females don't have a car to go to work, so having public transportation will certainly help them to find jobs and work. For developed countries, an improvement in traffic infrastructure can have a long-term effect on the female labor force participation rate, so it can increase the level of “natural rate of labor force participation” for females.====The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we document the history of the construction of subway systems across metropolitan cities in Korea, especially the subway system in Daejeon, and show labor force participation rates of females in Daejeon and other regions in Korea. Section 3 presents econometric models and how to obtain DID estimates from the models. Section 4 explains data and Section 5 presents estimation results from regression analyses and estimates obtained from DID estimators. Robustness checks are done in Section 6 and how the subway influenced male labor force participation in Daejeon is discussed in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes and presents the broader implications of this study.","Subways and the labor force participation of Females:The case of Daejeon, Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885918301677,30 April 2019,2019,Research Article,335.0

The projects that are tested are 22 European projects that are completed before the financial crisis and 25 European projects that are completed after. The method used is the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). One outcome is tested, being whether or not projects are delivered within the budgeted cost (on/over cost) till their completion. Findings show that after the GFC, the quality of the external environment, in terms of the institutional and the financial-economic context, matters more in order to deliver transport infrastructure projects on cost to completion. This means that transport infrastructure projects’ performance is depending on conditions exogenous to the projects more than before the GFC. The level of the cost of capital of the financing scheme is also an important condition, although for projects completed after the GFC, a low cost of capital can still lead to projects being over cost, when the external environment is unfavourable and the remuneration scheme brings high income risks and low cost coverage. Having a robust business model with respect to reducing costs during the construction phase of the project, which is a key factor based on literature, was found to matter both for the occurrence and non-occurrence of the cost outcome for the projects completed before the crisis, when combined with other conditions, but only for the non-occurrence of the cost outcome for the projects completed after the crisis.","Transport infrastructure projects are projects that require high investments for their realisation, sometimes tens of millions (projects), sometimes hundreds of millions (major projects) and sometimes billions of dollars (megaprojects) (Flyvbjerg, 2014). In 2015, European countries==== invested approximately 33 billion euro in rail, almost 46 billion euro in road, almost 1.9 billion euro in inland waterways, 1.9 billion euro in maritime port infrastructures and 2.8 billion euro in airport infrastructures (International Transport Forum, 2015). Transport infrastructures are key factors for the economic growth and competitiveness (Nazemzadeh, Meersman, & Vanelslander, 2015) and also for the regional-economic and social development (International Transport Forum, 2002; OECD, 2011). The International Monetary Fund (2014) found that in developed economies, like the ones examined in this paper, “1% of GDP increase in investment spending increases the level of output by about 0.4% in the same year and by 1.5% four years after the increase”. Therefore, the importance of these projects for the economy and society is evident.====The global financial crisis (GFC) augmented the difficulties related to the investments on transport infrastructures. The funding from the governments decreased (Clucas, 2017 and International Transport Forum, 2013), thus leading to a search for alternative sources of finance for the transport infrastructures, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Other sources of funding mostly for Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) are various EU programmes, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and World Bank loans (International Transport Forum, 2013). However, if we compare the amounts invested by the European countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis====,==== it is observed that the amounts invested after the crisis are significantly higher for rail infrastructures and almost equal for roads and inland waterways (International Transport Forum, 2015), likely due to the economic stimulus packages (International Transport Forum, 2013). On the contrary, for maritime ports and airports, the investments were halved after the crisis.====PPPs==== were also challenged because of the difficulties in financing (Burger, Tyson, Karpowicz, & Coelho, 2009; Liyanage, 2011). According to Liyanage (2011), the majority of the existing and planned PPP projects have been affected by factors such as “====”. Burger et al. (2009) state that access to and cost of finance are the main consequences of the financial crisis, affecting particularly PPP projects. According to Kappeler and Nemoz (2010), during the economic crisis, the PPP market shrunk in Europe in the majority of the countries and sectors. The total value of the EU PPPs dropped more than the number of deals; in 2009 the value of the PPP transactions in Europe was equal to 15.8 billion euro, which decreased by almost 50% in comparison with 2007.====Taking into consideration the importance of developing new transport infrastructures and maintaining the existing ones, and also the challenges that the crisis brought with respect to the investments, we realize that financing is important and difficult to get. Thus, investments should be done very carefully in order to avoid excessive costs. Excessive costs would mean that more financing is required, in addition to the initially financing planned, and this would increase the need for higher remuneration and revenue streams that would recover these costs. Therefore, it is very important to ensure that the projects under development have no or at least minimum cost overruns till their completion. Cost is one of the three main components of the so-called Project Management Triangle. That triangle is composed by three elements: cost, time and quality (Atkinson, 1999). In this paper, we focus on one of the triangle's elements, the cost, and we examine ====. The costs that are taken into consideration are the costs that take place till the completion of the projects' construction (from now on ‘actual project construction cost’) and are compared with the costs of the projects at the time of the contract award (from now on ‘contract construction budget’). Thus, we can say if the project till its completion has more, equal or less costs than the ones planned at the project award time.====As said, the GFC provided a rupture in project take-up and pushed many infrastructure projects into financing and other difficulties. In this paper, we aim to answer ==== However, the aim behind this study is not to ‘force’ the contractor for a project that is 100% on budget but to provide insights to the stakeholders involved in transport infrastructure project development, policy makers and academics about possible ‘recipes’ that lead projects to be on cost and over cost during times or not of economic recession. Therefore, the research that we undertake in this paper seeks to identify and compare the (combinations of) conditions that affect the cost performance (success and failure) of transport infrastructure projects ==== and ==== the financial economic crisis (2008). If the project is delivered within the contract construction budget, it is considered successful from that angle, whereas if it is delivered ‘over cost’, it is considered non-successful.====However, we should point out that delivering a project on cost might mirror good performance with respect to this specific element of the Project Management Triangle, but a project cannot be considered successful only based on this element but also taking into consideration other critical elements, such as the time, traffic, revenues, environmental, economic and social impact and also the scope for which the project was developed (Edkins, Geraldi, Morris, & Smith, 2012, p. 10 and Vanelslander, Sys, & Carlan, 2015).====A fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is conducted.

In most articles on the subject, WEs are major projects showing a certain political or even economic short-term appeal but that are essentially inefficient. In this paper, the definition includes, beyond those that are inefficient, projects that are financially unsustainable and/or very unfair to future generations when properly analysed over their project lifecycle. An early identification as WEs of those efficient projects from the socioeconomic point of view that are bound to entice the failure of a main stakeholder or are unfair to future generations, facilitates reconsidering their financial structuring in order to make them acceptable and avoid the WE label.====The authors propose a new approach to detect ==== that goes beyond the traditional detection through standard techniques, such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and involves the incorporation in decision-making of new indicators. Those of the ==== (IREM) show the importance of the long-term impacts arising from major investment in transport infrastructure. Using the annuities of the socioeconomic CBA and financial analyses, the IREM indicators allow a look beyond the future impact of the project on society's welfare –measured through conventional CBA– and its capacity of being financed, and produce a good assessment of its intergenerational effects. In this paper, the authors present the results of applying IREM to a set of transport projects in the European Union and, with more detail, to several Spanish motorway projects with private financing. The IREM's outputs indicate that most of the projects in the sample will be fair to future generations. Some of the analysed investments could, however, be considered as WEs when applying the intergenerational perspective. IREM appears therefore to be a useful tool to avoid decision-making mistakes in major infrastructure projects.","Decisions about transport infrastructure development are usually based on the general belief that investing in public assets is “productive” for society. In a slightly more sophisticated setting, decision makers require that such public investments be efficient, i.e. expected to generate more socioeconomic benefits than the resources consumed for infrastructure construction and for its operation and maintenance. For investments that can be deemed to reduce the wellbeing of its future members, either because they are inefficient from an economic point of view or because they are financially unsustainable, the label of ==== (WE) has often been informally used. In this paper, the WE label is also used to identify projects whose redistribution effects can be very unfair when properly analysed over the project lifecycle and therefore, as in the white elephant story, may be ruinous for future generations.====Efficiency is typically evaluated ex-ante through a conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (Meunier, Quinet, & Quinet, 2013; Thomopoulos, Grant-Muller, & Tight, 2009). In the transport sector, CBA mostly focuses on the analysis of users’ utility, even though costs and benefits are unevenly distributed among the various project stakeholders (Turró, 2004) and investment in infrastructure entails strong impacts of social, environmental and territorial nature over and above user effects (Beyazit, 2011; Litman, 1996; Raux, Souche, & Mercier, 2006; Trannoy, 2011; Viegas, 2001). The uneven distribution of the project impacts is often pursued by decision makers in order to favour specific social groups or stakeholders (Henisz & Zelner, 2006), whilst non-users impacts, such as climate change agreements, are increasingly taken as the sole justification for certain actions. In some instances, redistribution seems to be the only real argument for certain investments, although this is seldom clearly reflected in the decisional process (Penyalver & Turró, 2018).====Major infrastructure projects systematically involve a strong responsibility for the Government Promoting the Investment (GPI), i.e. the government agency behind the investment. The GPI is therefore expected to engage only in projects that are efficient from the socioeconomic point of view when considering their whole project cycle (Berechman, 2009; Salling & Banister, 2009; Turró, 2015) and ensure that the financing of the project is structured in a way that guarantees that it will not be stopped due to lack of money, at least during the period of its execution and early operation. When financial sustainability is not ensured during this period, a project easily ends up with blockages and consequent cost overruns and delays that unavoidably affect its efficiency. Of course, there is always a great deal of uncertainty on the assumptions adopted in the feasibility analyses and some projects considered convenient ex-ante could become negative for society due to exogenous shocks.==== However, this is essentially related to the quality of forecasts, a topic falling outside the scope of this paper, which concentrates on the long-term implications of investment decisions based on the best available hypothesis on the consequences of the project at appraisal time.====The possibility of blockages may also come from the opposition of specific sectors/groups or even from the hostility of the bulk of taxpayers. Public investment decisions in general, and for the transport sector in particular, are quite often driven by considerations other than the result of the socioeconomic appraisal (Henisz & Zelner, 2006; Robinson & Torvik, 2004); when this is the case, they are supposed to ensure policy compliance and fairness. On the other hand, even when major investments are deemed efficient from the point of view of the overall society and respond to policy objectives, they may result in unsustainable and/or unfair financial costs for the GPI behind the investment (Hoyos, 2014) and, by extension, for the taxpayer supporting the public promoter. In this sense, it must be observed that, in traditional project appraisal, investment costs are essentially assigned to the first years of the project cycle when the resources are actually consumed. This is reasonable in terms of society's overall wealth (in available resources), but the financial expenditure involved in this consumption is not actually paid during this period, but according to the financing formula adopted. This means that the cash flows that end up covering the financing of the project are generally quite different than the costs and benefits in terms of resources considered in the CBA and depend on the use of loans and other financing mechanisms, which typically postpone the actual payment of the investment.====The financing formula and, in particular, the distribution over the years of the actual payments that concerned users and/or taxpayers will endure, is key to determine if a project that appears as viable according to standard practice can be considered as unfair due to the negative redistribution effects on future generations. It is obvious that future taxpayers and project users cannot react to present decisions. This does not justify, however, that they are treated unjustly. Especially when distant generations will be affected, intergenerational inequality and unfair redistribution may pass unnoticed, but our society is actually becoming increasingly aware, through issues such as climate change and pensions coverage, of the need to incorporate intergenerational fairness into our present decisions.====To measure the effects of the financing formula on the generations concerned during the project lifespan is relatively complex. The ==== or IREM (Penyalver & Turró, 2017) has been designed to analyse these effects comparing the increase in resources generated by the project (net socioeconomic benefits) with the flows of obligations (in terms of actual payments) for the successive overlapping generations affected by the project. IREM indicators may offer valuable insights to identify those projects that would represent a clearly unfair treatment of future generations, in spite of showing an acceptable socioeconomic return for the current society (Penyalver & Turró, 2017). Although it is clear that efficiency should be the main concern of decision makers, the financial implications of certain financing formulae commonly used for the development of major projects of transport infrastructure justify that even efficient projects must show that their financial structuring ensures sustainability and fairness, i.e. that all major participants in the project are able to comply with their expected financial commitments and that future generations are fairly treated.====This paper is organised as follows: The next section offers a review of the literature on both the concept of ==== (WEs) in relation to infrastructure investments and the root causes that may bias the results of conventional feasibility analysis. During this review, a number of arguments on the relevance of the analysis of potential redistribution issues for WEs identification are introduced. Section 3 proposes a comprehensive methodological procedure to hunt WEs. Even if the results of the CBA should be central in normative decision-making to identify WEs (Robinson & Torvik, 2004; Scambary, 2015), a major assumption here is that a step-by-step procedure that incorporates the long-term effects of major projects is necessary to detect WEs and thus to improve the decision-making process. This procedure is actually considered a major contribution of this paper as it encompasses, for first time, both traditional economic approaches and the analysis of redistribution effects, including the intergenerational ones. Section 4 describes the general outlines on how to perform a proper intergenerational impacts analysis with the IREM model. Although the model have been largely presented in other pieces already published, this paper introduces, as a novelty, several details related to financial structuring that are important to correctly run IREM in practice. In addition, it presents an overview of the intergenerational equity patterns obtained from the first systematic application of the model to a relevant sample of (greenfield) projects carried out in the European Union. A more detailed analysis of these intergenerational impacts, based on a case study of three motorway projects in Andalusia (Spain) shows, in Section 5, how IREM can be used to detect WEs. Section 6 offers general conclusions and recommendations to avoid decision-making mistakes in major infrastructure projects.

This asymmetry is consistent with the psychological optimism bias whereby people tend to overestimate (underestimate) the likelihood of positive (negative) future outcomes. We conclude by providing an explanation for our findings, including a brief policy discussion.","A number of studies have employed attitudinal measures to examine energy-related topics. Consistent with the principle of loss aversion, Greene, Evans, and Hiestand (2013) present survey evidence indicating that US consumers systematically undervalue future vehicle fuel savings relative to their expected value. DeCicco, Yan, Keusch, Muñoz, and Neidert (2015) analyze the data from a new attitudinal survey on public views about the reliability, affordability, and environmental impact of energy. One noteworthy conclusion is that “consumers seem to want energy to be both affordable and ‘clean,’ without perceiving these two goals as entailing a tradeoff” (DeCicco et al., 2015, p. 755). Baghestani (2016) also employs survey data to show that real gasoline prices asymmetrically influence US consumers' economic outlook. That is, consumers' economic outlook deteriorates when gasoline prices rise but remains unchanged when gasoline prices fall.====We add to this literature by analyzing US consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes from the long-running Michigan Surveys of Consumers (MSC). Every month, the MSC selects a nationally-representative random sample of at least 500 US consumers to construct the data on consumers' assessments of current and future economic conditions in addition to consumers’ vehicle-buying attitudes, among others. We utilize these data along with real retail gasoline prices for 1993–2018 in order to see how vehicle-buying attitudes of consumers respond to changes in their assessments of current and future economic conditions and to changes in real retail gasoline prices.====Existing research shows that the price of gasoline is an important factor affecting consumers' decisions in purchasing various types of vehicles. Klier and Linn (2010) investigate the impact of national average gasoline prices on national sales of new low and high mileage per gallon (MPG) cars. They find that a rise in gasoline prices lowers sales of low-MPG cars relative to sales of high-MPG cars. In another study, Li, Timmins, and von Haefen (2009, p. 113) show that “high gasoline prices affect fleet fuel economy through two channels: shifting new auto purchases towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, and speeding the scrappage of older, less fuel-efficient used vehicles.” Since the MSC does not specifically ask consumers about their attitudes in buying fuel economy vehicles, in this study, we examine the impact of real gasoline prices on consumers’ buying attitudes of vehicles in general.====Another important factor influencing consumers' decisions in purchasing vehicles is economic conditions. Conventional wisdom suggests that consumers are more inclined to make major purchases when they feel confident about their personal financial future and the overall state of the economy. In this study, we do not employ such variables as real output or real disposable income often utilized in the literature as measures of economic conditions. Instead, we follow Baghestani and Palmer (2017) and make use of the MSC consumers' assessments of both current and future economic conditions for two reasons. First, in constructing these assessments, the MSC probes consumer sentiment on personal finances, buying conditions, and business conditions (Curtin, 1982), which are very much relevant in explaining the behavior of consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes. Second, the use of the MSC data allows us to separate consumers’ assessments of future economic conditions from assessments of current economic conditions. As a measure of economic outlook, the former variable is of primary importance, since making major purchases such as vehicles requires long-term commitments from consumers.====As for methodology, we employ unit root and cointegration tests in addition to error-correction modelling. In particular, our model contains four series: consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes, real retail gasoline prices, consumers' assessments of current economic conditions, and consumers' assessments of future economic conditions. Our estimates for 1993–2018 lead to a number of important results. In the long-run, consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes are positively related to both consumers' assessments of current and future economic conditions but negatively related to real gasoline prices. In the short-run, consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes respond symmetrically to changes in gasoline prices. For instance, consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes deteriorate in response to rising real retail gasoline prices and improve in response to falling real retail gasoline prices by the same magnitude. Consistent with the psychological negativity bias, consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes respond asymmetrically to changes in their assessments of current economic conditions. For instance, vehicle-buying attitudes of consumers deteriorate in response to deteriorations in their assessments of current economic conditions. However, when consumers' assessments of current economic conditions improve, vehicle-buying attitudes remain unchanged. Consistent with the psychological optimism bias, consumers' vehicle-buying attitudes respond asymmetrically to changes in their assessments of future economic conditions. For instance, vehicle-buying attitudes of consumers improve in response to improvements in their assessments of future economic conditions. However, when consumers’ assessments of future economic conditions deteriorate, vehicle-buying attitudes remain unchanged.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the data.

Under this assumption, AVs will probably affect the perception of time and its value.====These results, however, should be taken with caution, as the sample is very small, travel time and travel monetary costs are ignored, as are housing costs, and mode choice and residential location are not modelled simultaneously.","Over the past few years, several studies focused on the impact of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on transportation systems (Duell, Levin, Boyles, & Waller, 2016; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Levin & Boyles, 2015). Some authors focused on the effects of AVs in terms of energy impacts and sustainability (Brown, Gonder, & Repac, 2014; Conlon, Ballare, & Lin, 2018; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2014; Wadud, MacKenzie, & Leiby, 2016); others on the effects of AVs in terms of road capacity utilization (Fernandes & Nunes, 2010, Friedrich, 2015; Tientrakool, Ho, and Maxemchuk (2011)), car parks optimization (Nourinejad, Bahrami, & Roorda, 2018) and accessibility (Kim, Rousseau, Freedman, & Nicholson, 2015; Meyer, Becker, Bösch, & Axhausen, 2017). Research on consumer preferences and potential adoption of AVs can be found in Lavieri et al. (2017).====Within this research framework, we are interested in understanding if a change in the travel time perception produced by AVs might be associated with a tendency for households to relocate to cheaper suburban areas. Already Glaeser and Kahn (2004) found that urban sprawl, decentralization and the rise of polycentric ‘edge’ cities (Garreau, 1992; Gordon, Kumar, & Richardson, 1989a, b) are product of car-based living. Meyer et al. (2017) highlighted that AVs will generate a new wave of suburbanization and urban sprawl.====The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, 2013) defined six levels of automation. Beginning from zero (no automation), levels 1–3 still require a licensed driver, while fully automated vehicles (level 4–5) can self-drive in all situations. This work assumed level 5, i.e. full automation vehicles. This level of automation promises to allow the driver, that should be properly called passenger, to pursue activities such as reading, using smartphones or tablets, wearing makeup etc. Under these conditions, it is a fair assumption that driving will be less positively correlated with stress (Legrain, Eluru, & El-Geneidy, 2015); thus, the tolerance threshold in commuting time will probably increase. Few studies focused on the nature and strength of the association between residential change and commuting tolerance (Clarck, Huang, & Withers, 2003, He, Zhao, & He, 2016, Milakis, Cervero, van Wee, and Maat, 2015, Prashker, Shiftan, & Hershkovitch-Sarusi, 2008).====In the light of these considerations, this study is a first attempt to understand how the most performant class of AVs will affect the residential decision-making and the related consequences in terms of traffic congestion on the real case study of the city of Rome (Italy) in the time horizon up to 2050. Moreover, through an extensive simulation effort, this study shows the impact of relocation on the road network under different rates of AVs ride-sharing service. Previous contributions on Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) can be found in Chen and Kockelman (2016), Fagnant and Kockelman (2016), Hyland and Mahmassani (2017), Karamanis, Niknejad, and Angeloudis (2017), Krueger, Rashidi, and Rose (2016), and Zachariah, Gao, Kornhauser, and Mufti (2014).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In section 3, the results of the study are presented and discussed, separately for the surveying, the behavioral modelling and the simulation.

As a consequence, urban road toll and electric vehicles become the winning ticket for Lyon ==== in the future.","Although the financial situation of the Lyon's public transport network (France) is not an emergency situation at present, its financial structure evolution and its amount of funding requirement have revealed the first signs of concern: the increase of the yield generated by the Transport Contribution paid by companies has declined (+4% a year between 2001 and 2008, but + 2% between 2009 and 2012, see the Transport Organization Authority, Sytral, 2013), and a growing share of this resource is now used to offset the operating deficit.====One solution considered is to introduce urban road pricing. Added to the well-known objective to reduce congestion in large European conurbations, this pricing measure would get car drivers to contribute, as they benefit indirectly from public transport (reduction of congestion due to modal transfer). In addition, the principle of pricing car-use is in line with the aim of reducing pollution (notably by particles) and greenhouse gas emissions. The beneficial effects of urban road pricing on economic efficiency are already well-known and widely signaled (Knight, 1924; Pigou, 1920; Vickrey, 1963; Walters, 1961) and an increasing number of successful experiences have been reported, especially in Europe (Santos & Fraser, 2006; Eliasson, 2008 and, 2009; Rotaris, Danielis, Marcucci, & Massiani, 2010; Souche, Mercier, & Ovtracht, 2016).====This is not to say that car drivers fail to pay anything to internalize the negative externalities they create, but to assume that car drivers do not currently pay their fair share. Nor does it entail ignoring the fact that public transport benefits from substantial subsidies from the public authorities in France. Rather, the aim is to consider that car drivers should make a greater contribution to the future if we are to seek to make those who create negative environmental externalities responsible for paying for them. Indeed, given the current state of the art regarding technology transposed over the number of persons carried in a vehicle, cars pollute more than public transport.====We explain the Lyon's problem of financing public transport added to traffic congestion linked with environmental problems, in particular air pollution. As road pricing can both reduce traffic congestion and linked pollution, and get revenues for public transport, this measure could be a solution for a city confronted to several difficulties. In these circumstances, it has become necessary to evaluate the potential effects of introducing this pricing solution. Hence, one of the main contributions of the paper is to present a useful combination of different types of impacts, namely those related to the environment, accessibility, public transport performance and financing requirements. Different indicators have been underlined in the literature to evaluate transport policies in urban areas: the accessibility indicators (in particular Geurs & Van Wee, 2004; Holl, 2007; Kwan & Weber, 2008); the inequality indicators (Karlström & Franklin, 2009; Ramjerdi, 2006; Souche et al., 2016; Sumalee, May, & Shepherd, 2005) and the environmental indicators (Daniel & Bekka, 2000; Eliasson, 2009; Rich & Nielsen, 2007). Performance indicators can also be used (Ahn, 2009; Small, 2004; Tirachini, Hensher, & Rose, 2014), though this is far from being the case for indicators relating to public transport funding requirements. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the combined use of all these indicators has not yet been reported in the literature.====In the present paper, we propose to evaluate the impact of a new pricing measure on all these indicators. We test different pricing solutions for the Lyon Metropolitan Area (France) based on possible scenarios for the future (2030), that will fuel the MOSART simulation modelling platform (Bonnafous, Crozet, Mercier, Ovtracht, & Thiebaut, 2009; Mercier, 2013). The outputs of MOSART will then permit calculating indicators (environmental, accessibility, social inequality, and public transport performance, public funding requirement) to help public decision-making.====The analysis of our results shows that urban pricing capable of generating new revenues without increasing inequality, combined with the transformation of the fleet of vehicles into electric vehicles that produces positive results in terms of CO==== emissions, could be considered as a pricing policy for the Lyon Metropolitan Area by 2030.====First, we present a brief review of the literature on the indicators used (Part 1). Then we explain the methodology chosen, notably the MOSART platform, the data used and the hypotheses formulated (Part 2). Lastly, we present our results and discuss them (Part 3).",Urban toll and electric vehicles: The winning ticket for Lyon Metropolitan Area (France),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919300605,March 2019,2019,Research Article,340.0

However, the diffusion of electric vehicles has been limited so far. In an effort to facilitate scaled-up deployment of electric vehicles, this paper examines the economic feasibility of replacing the current fleet of fossil fuel taxis in Seoul with electric vehicle (EV) taxis by gradually phasing out the former based on their operational lifetime. In the cost-benefit analysis for such a transition, costs of purchasing vehicles and constructing and maintaining charging infrastructure are estimated based on the market prices and characteristics of taxi transport in Seoul. On the benefit side, the avoided environmental costs due to reduced air pollutants and ","Transport is fundamental to economic and social development. It generates employment opportunities and drives economic growth within and beyond its own sector. In Europe, for example, the transport sector directly employs around 10 million people and accounts for about 5% of gross domestic product (European Commission, 2017). It has an even larger impact on the economy via other sectors that depend on transport services to move people, goods, and services in an efficient manner. Transport also contributes to social inclusion and community cohesion as well-connected transport systems facilitate interactions in society.====The development of transport systems, however, has also brought negative externalities to society, such as traffic congestion, accidents, and noise. In particular, transport is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ambient air pollution in urban areas. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), globally 14% of GHG emissions in 2010 were released from the transport sector (IPCC, 2014). On the county level, more GHG emissions is attributed to the transport sector if the country is more car-centric and developed in general. For instance, the transport sector of the United States produced 27% of the total GHG emissions in 2015 (EPA, 2017), almost twice the global average in percentage terms. Transport is also responsible for around half of energy-related nitrogen oxide (NO====) emissions and is an important source of primary particulate matter, PM==== which affects human health more than any other pollutant. Given the global trend of rapid urbanization with increasing demand for mobility particularly in developing countries, these environmental and health externalities from the transport sector will continue to be exacerbated under the business-as-usual scenario.====Dating back to its invention in the 1800s, the electric vehicle had long been considered as an alternative to the internal combustion engine vehicle but without much success. The Paris Agreement in 2015 setting out the target of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C (UNFCCC, 2015), however, has given the electric vehicle renewed attention as a critical building block in achieving the transport sector's GHG emissions reduction goals for the Paris Agreement.====Electric vehicles normally do not produce any tailpipe GHG or air pollutant emissions. If well-to-wheel energy used in them is produced through renewable sources, benefits of using electric vehicles are even greater. Despite the intrinsic benefits of electric vehicles, their mass diffusion has proven to be difficult so far. More expensive prices of electric vehicles relative to their fossil fuel counterparts have been a major barrier to their scaled-up deployment. However, the cost of batteries, which currently makes up between one-third and half of the vehicle cost, is coming down rapidly and it is projected that the cost of lithium-ion batteries would reach USD 100/kWh by 2023, at which point an entry-level equivalent of a Tesla Model S, for instance, can be purchased for USD 15,000 (Seba, 2014). Inadequate charging stations and long charging time are other impediments to rapid adoption of electric vehicles. As technology advances, driving ranges of electric vehicles will become longer with less charging time, which will relieve the pressure to build many charging stations.====Even with electric vehicles becoming more competitive technically and financially, the public may not opt for these new options quickly except some early adopters partly due to the inertia of using the vehicles familiar to them. This is potentially where the government can intervene and take the initiative to make the transition to electric vehicles for its mobility needs by, for example, replacing its official-purpose vehicles with electric ones. Another fleet of vehicles that might be electrified with relative ease through appropriate policy mandates or incentives from the government is taxis or rental cars.====Taxis in urban areas have the characteristic that their daily travel distances are much longer than those of private cars which usually sit in parking spaces most of the day. Moreover, the idling time of taxis tends to be much longer than that of other vehicles, which leads to higher emissions of GHG and air pollutants. This means that the impact of a fossil fuel taxi on the environment would be disproportionately higher compared to a comparable private vehicle. As such, replacing conventional taxis with electric ones would greatly reduce per vehicle GHG and air pollutants emissions. It will also help raise awareness of electric vehicles as taxis are easily noticed on the streets. Countries like the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands are actively running electric vehicle (EV) taxies, while London, UK plans to issue new taxi licenses only for electric vehicles from 2018 (Hall, Moultak, & Lutsey, 2017). Under the Seoul Transport Vision 2030, the city government of Seoul, Republic of Korea has made 11 “promises” to provide the citizens with mobility services that are people-oriented, shared, and environmentally friendly (Seoul Metropolitan Government, 2017). Although not explicitly considered in the vision document, EV taxis can be an option to implement one of the promises, “Transforming the transport modes and facilities into environmentally friendly ones.” Currently only a small number of EV taxis (around 60) are in operation in Seoul as a pilot project since 2015.====With a view to full deployment of EV taxis in Seoul, this paper examines the economic feasibility of introducing EV taxis in the form of a policy requirement. We take the approach of replacing the current fleet of taxis with EV taxis by gradually phasing out the former based on their operational lifetime because such a scheme would be implemented most naturally and face least resistance from the taxi owners, if any. To this end, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted where the transport planning model is incorporated to estimate vehicle speeds on the roads more accurately. This is a novel feature that distinguishes this paper from other similar work where the city-wise average vehicle speed is often used, bearing the risk of calculating emission factors inaccurately. The literature on the economic appraisal of introducing EV taxis appears to be scant. Carpenter, Curtis, and Keshav (2014), Tseng and Chau (2017), and Kim, Lee, and Kim (2017) considered the issue but their analysis centered around the profitability of taxi operators, not on the benefits and costs to society.====This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, characteristics of taxi transport in Seoul are described to set the stage. The calculations of costs and benefits of introducing EV taxis are given in detail in Section 3. How the transport planning model is used within the cost-benefit analysis is explained in the section. In Section 4, findings and conclusions are provided.",Economic appraisal of implementing electric vehicle taxis in Seoul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919300617,March 2019,2019,Research Article,341.0

Furthermore, drivers who declare a willingness to buy HEVs do not always do so for environmental reasons, but rather for reputational issues related to their self-image. Thus, in order to increase the market share for HEV vehicles in the Spanish market, informative campaigns and additional economic incentives may be designed.","Global warming and air pollution are global problems caused by an increase in the world's total greenhouse gases (GHG) and pollution. The degradation of air quality has harmful implications for human health and wellbeing, biodiversity, and the environment. Although it is a global problem requiring international solutions, it also needs the existence of local initiatives adapted to the specific sectorial characteristics of each country and pollution problems (European Environment Agency, 2008).====The total GHG emissions of European Union (EU) has decreased by 22% between 1990 and 2015, due in large part to the economic recession in EU and its member countries' policies (Eurostat, 2017). Despite the reduction of the EU's total GHG emissions, the transport sector has increased its contribution significantly since 1990. In fact, transport emitted 23% of the EU's GHG emissions in 2015 (Eurostat, 2017). For this reason, decarbonizing the transport sector, especially road transport which contributes about two thirds of the transport sector GHG emissions (European Commission, 2017), will be the EU's great challenge for the next years.====Despite the seriousness of pollution, the market share of environmentally friendly vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) (see definition in Hackbarth & Madlener, 2013) in many countries is still very small, although its growth rate is increasing. In the first quarter of 2018, alternative-powered vehicles accounted for 6.5% of EU car sales, with electrically-chargeable vehicles making up 1.7% of all cars sold (ACEA, 2018).====Earlier findings about drivers' preferences for AFVs, justify the need to conduct a study where preferences towards environmental and economic attributes are assessed simultaneously. In this research paper, two stated preference methods, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) (Louviere, Flynn, & Carson, 2010), and a payment card format were used to elicit drivers' preferences towards vehicle types and corresponding attributes. The DCE makes it possible to disaggregate the individual's welfare assigned to a given vehicle into marginal utilities (and respective marginal valuations) corresponding to each of the different attributes. In fact, DCEs are commonly used to elicit preferences for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) [Beck, Rose, & Hensher, 2013; Caulfield, Farrell, & McMahon, 2010; Potoglou & Kanaroglou, 2007). Most of the cited studies were carried out in North America (Hidrue, Parsons, Kempton, & Gardner, 2011; Kahn, 2007; Klein, 2007; Lin, Chen, & Conzelmann, 2012; Partridge, 2013; Thatchenkery & Beresteanu, 2008), or in Australia (Abdoolakhan, 2010; Beck et al., 2013; Chua, Lee, & Sadeque, 2010), while HEVs penetration rate in these geographical areas is significantly higher than in Europe (Achtnicht, 2012; Hackbarth & Madlener, 2013, 2016; Ziegler, 2012). The general interest of the present work is to identify the most important factors that drive preferences for specific types of vehicles, especially HEVs; while testing the robustness of our findings across elicitation methodologies.====The present research provides innovative results that contribute towards improving our understanding of the nature of the choice of vehicles. Significant preference heterogeneity with regards to automobiles is found. In particular, drivers who buy HEVs do not always do so for environmental reasons, but because of reputational issues. Moreover, the lack of interest for HEVs may be motivated by other reasons, or due to mistrust or misconceptions about this technology. Although conventional vehicles still dominate the market, HEVs and flexible-fuel vehicles (FFV) will be able to gain a significant market share in the future, at least among certain segments. Willingness to pay (WTP) estimates elicited via LCM and via a payment card WTP question, show that both methods lead to a positive WTP for HEVs.",Assessing drivers’ preferences for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) in Spain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919300630,March 2019,2019,Research Article,342.0

However, those initiatives have not been implemented so far at a large scale. This paper investigates OHD potential in Rome, focusing on one of the most important barriers to its adoption, i.e. stakeholder acceptability. The study investigates stakeholders' preferences for different OHD configurations using both a qualitative approach, based on in-depth interviews, and a quantitative analysis, based on an interactive multi-actor multi-criteria analysis. Results show that stakeholders prefer a solution where OHD are jointly implemented together with one or more urban consolidation centres. This preliminary analysis paves the way for further technical/economic evaluations needed for OHD implementation in Rome. Stakeholders’ involvement is of outmost importance to understand their heterogeneous preferences and increase their awareness of urban freight transport problems, with the overall aim to foster behaviour change.","Cities are responsible for 75% of global CO==== emissions that cause climate change (UN-Habitat, 2015). Among the different sectors, transport is the second most polluting and the only one whose emissions continue to grow (European Environment Agency, 2017). Urban roads are the most affected by passenger and freight traffic flows that take place in certain periods of the day/week and year. Congestion increases the environmental burden that transport provokes and represents a social cost in terms of lower circulation-speed (Marcucci & Polidori, 2000). A sustainable development of cities must necessarily foresee a reduction of the environmental impact of transport. Urban freight transport (UFT) represents 8–15% of the total traffic (Transmodal, 2012). Despite several efforts to induce a modal shift toward sustainable modes, there is still a great imbalance in favour of road transport (e.g. Alessandrini, Delle Site, Gatta, Marcucci, & Zhang, 2016; Evangelinos, Tscharaktschiew, Marcucci, & Gatta, 2018; Marcucci, Site, Gatta, & Pompetti, 2018b). In 2016, freight transport by trucks accounted for 75% tonne-kilometre in the EU28 cities (OECD, 2018). The demand for mobility of goods is concurrently expanding with the demographic growth and the rise of citizens’ standard of life. However, there is a lack of data and awareness with respect to UFT problems related to these phenomena (Le Pira et al., 2017b). Therefore, most of the time UFT regulation and intervention policies are the result of choices not supported by robust analyses, regardless of the consequences they might bear on various stakeholders.====Cascetta, Cartenì, Pagliara, and Montanino (2015) define transport stakeholders as “people and organizations who hold a stake in a particular issue, even though they have no formal role in the decision-making process”. UFT policies mainly affect four main stakeholder categories: retailers, transport providers, citizens and public administrations (Taniguchi & Thompson, 2014). In fact, transport inefficiencies and other negative externalities raise economic, social and environmental costs for both businesses and citizens. In this regard, it is noteworthy that not all studies consider citizens as an important stakeholder category in freight transport, since their interests are supposed to be already represented by the public administration. However, further studies suggest that involving citizens early in the policy-making process is positively correlated with successful policy adoption and effects (Le Pira, Inturri, Ignaccolo, & Pluchino, 2018).====People's behaviour towards an initiative might substantially change if they feel involved in the decision-making process, since participation changes their perception about problems. Therefore, cooperation can favour policy acceptance much more than any imposition by law (Marcucci, Gatta, Marciani, & Cossu, 2017a). However, the different objectives each stakeholder category pursues make the adoption of shared initiatives extremely difficult. Nevertheless, one has to acknowledge that concerted initiatives are more effective and durable. In fact, unilaterally proposed solutions entail numerous infringements and expensive control measures. With reference to UFT, it has been observed that traffic restrictions in historic centres to relieve congestion on the area may, in some cases, even worsen transport-related negative externalities by concentrating traffic flows in specific hours (Da Rios & Gattuso, 2003). In contrast, one can achieve decongestion by encouraging off-hour deliveries (OHD), i.e. a time shift in freight deliveries from peak hours to off-peak hours to distribute traffic more evenly during the day (Holguín-Veras, 2008; NICHES, 2008; Sánchez-Díaz, Georén, & Brolinson, 2017; Vilain & Wolfrom, 2000).====The first modern OHD pilot project deployed in New York practically demonstrated that a voluntary participation to OHD requires an active dialogue with the main stakeholders within a given freight transport chain (Holguín -Veras & Polimeni, 2006). The success of OHD was contagious and other European cities such as Barcelona, Brussels, London and Dublin tested similar initiatives benefitting from the knowledge acquired via the pilot tests and, also, thanks to the financial support by the European Union (e.g. Civitas Miracles, C-Liege). The main advantages for a city include traffic reduction, greater attractiveness and safety (Sánchez-Díaz et al., 2017).====Despite the advantages, few cities have implemented OHD initiatives so far. This can be ascribed both to scarce knowledge/sensitiveness towards UFT-related problems and to the need for acceptance by stakeholders. Moreover, the success of an OHD implementation depends on several stakeholder characteristics, such as their sensitivity to environmental issues and the ability of the public part to find an agreement among the many stakeholders involved with often conflicting interests (Le Pira et al., 2017b).====The paper aims to investigate stakeholders’ preferences for different OHD configurations using a qualitative-quantitative approach. The case study in Rome represents a preliminary stakeholder analysis and lays the foundations for a future OHD pilot project based on best practices for UFT sustainability in a situation of scarce resources.====The paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents a succinct review of methods and tools available to support stakeholder engagement and elicit their preferences.

Therefore, this research focused on efficiencies of IWTs and possible improvements by analyzing the optimal configuration and operation of Reach Stackers (RSs) and terminal Yard Cranes (YCs) given certain throughput levels at IWTs. Our paper contributes to current scientific knowledge through the development of a tailor-made new model based on the maritime container terminal literature combined with the specificities of IWTs. The model results show that a growing throughput results in ==== for IWTs. For small terminals, an unbalanced import/export-ratio (80-20 or vice versa) is often more efficient (and thus sustainable) than a balanced ratio (50-50), while this changes for larger terminals. Furthermore, by applying the model and analyzing the sensitivities, the paper contributes to managerial decisions to be taken by IWW terminal operators and also gives insight into the consequences of certain sustainability policies of local authorities on terminal operations. If these environmental rules and regulations are implemented, results indicate that this leads to a lower terminal capacity and thus higher costs.","Due to the dominant role of road freight transport, a large variety of problems arises in this sector (Verdonk, Caris, Ramaekers, & Janssens, 2014). These problems include for instance congestion and different types of emissions (carbon dioxide, noise, fine dust), see e.g. Bergqvist, Macharis, Meers, and Woxenius (2015). Intermodal freight transportation such as Inland WaterWay (IWW) transport and the use of IWW-terminals (IWTs) can be considered as a partial solution for these sustainability issues. This is because intermodal freight transport is often considered as more sustainable (less congested and depending on the exact characteristics also emitting less pollution) compared to freight transport by road. Furthermore, IWW transport is often seen as offering sufficient additional capacity for further growth of intermodal freight transport (Konings, Kreutzberger, & Maraš, 2013). The more precise growth potential of IWW transport depends on the IWW network which in certain parts of Europe is well developed (Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands) and in other parts of Europe is less well developed limiting the growth potential there (or maybe even blocking further growth). Overall, in Europe, IWW transport represents around 5% of the container transport, but this share is growing (Smid, Dekker, & Wiegmans, 2016). While in the Netherlands, the market share is considerably higher; approximately 35% of all container transport is executed by barge (Bureau Voorlichting Binnenvaart, 2016). IWW transportation through scale economies could therefore meet the need for efficient, environmentally friendly and less congested transportation in certain parts of Europe as compared to road transport. However, the (environmental) advantages of IWW transportation can be disputable because a delicate interplay is needed between pre- and end-haulage, terminals, and the barge transport. Especially the barge transport part contains a wide range of variables such as the area concerned, the kind of barge (type and size), the competitive transport alternative, the need for the river maintenance, the route (upstream or downstream), the type of operations (maximum 14 h per day), semi-continuous (max. 18 h/day) or continuous operations (24 h/day)), fuel consumption, loading degree, delays in port areas, and the possibilities for a roundtrip that influence the resulting environmental advantages (see e.g. Wiegmans & Konings, 2015).====In order to compete with road transport, it is of importance to further increase the quality and sustainability of IWW transport and especially also the IWTs. In Dotoli, Epicoco, Falagario, Seatzu, and Turchiao (2017), the authors analyze the combined operation of terminal handlings and transport mean (train) composition to arrive at optimized combinations. Sun and Schonfeld (2016) analyze the effect of severe disruptions at intermodal rail freight transfer terminals. Both papers focus on the importance of planning rail transport with rail terminal operations, while IWTs are much more flexible with respect to transport mean (barges) schedules and schedule disruptions pose less of a challenge to IWTs. Still, these hinterland terminals are often regarded as crucial points in transport chains, where costs increase and chances exist for quality decreases (Bowersox, Closs, & Helferich, 1986). One of the ways to increase the performance, sustainability and quality of IWW transportation is to focus on the configuration of the IWT. In this respect, it is essential to ensure that the terminals work as efficient and effective as possible (Verdonk et al., 2014). One of the most important aspects of these inland container terminals is the interplay between quay, the terminal internal transport means and the container yard operations (Carlo, Vis, & Roodbergen, 2014a). This interplay can also be seen in more detail in Fig. 1 below. In this paper, the container terminal infrastructure and operations that are concerned with the container handling are being examined, especially the use and interplay of the two main yard handling systems: Reach Stackers (RSs) and terminal Yard Cranes (YCs) operating in the container yard.====The most important decisions to be made concerning the operations in the terminal yard area are: selecting the type and number of handling systems to perform the handling and terminal internal transport. Selecting the appropriate equipment combination is important because it determines the fixed and variable terminal costs, as well as the terminal performance. If the IWT performance is good, it is able to contribute to a better performance of intermodal freight transport and to improve the sustainability of the overall freight transport system at the same time. This problem differs from more common problems at maritime terminals where for example, the scheduling of yard cranes with minimum energy consumption takes center stage (Sha et al., 2017). Given the number of Quay Cranes (QCs) in operation at IWTs, the most important decision is to implement an YC (or increase the number of YCs), in combination with the number of RSs. The moment for implementing an YC (or add a second or third one) at the IWT, to increase efficiency, performance and thereby the sustainability of the transport system is being evaluated given the IWT size. This leads to the following research question: How could the efficiency and sustainability of an IWW container terminal be improved by an optimal configuration and operation of RSs and terminal YCs? Our paper contributes to current knowledge through the development of a new model that focusses purely on the specificities of IWTs. In that respect is our model unique. Furthermore, by applying the model and analyzing sensitivities, the paper contributes to managerial decisions to be taken by IWW terminal operators.

In this context, characterized by scarce resources and increasing demand for mobility, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can bridge the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport. Taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), they can supply transport solutions ranging from flexible transit to ride sharing services, providing real-time “on demand” mobility through fleets of vehicles shared by different passengers. The optimal design of a DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the ==== point of view). In this paper, an agent-based model (ABM) fed with ","Mobility is a fundamental component of urban life. The increase in city population and climate change challenges raise the need for a more sustainable and efficient transport system (EC-European Commission, 2011; United Nations, 2016). Policies for sustainable mobility generally act on three main factors: (1) the amount of transport activity, i.e. how many kilometres people travel; (2) the amount of vehicles needed to transport people, which depends on the capacity of the vehicle and its load factor as well; (3) the energy to move the vehicle for one km. These factors can be interpreted respectively as land-use, transport and energy intensity (Ignaccolo, Inturri, Le Pira, Caprì, & Mancuso, 2016).====Public transport has the potential to reach the lowest transport intensity, as it traditionally uses high-capacity vehicles, well suited to serve high-density and high-demand mobility corridors. Nevertheless, fixed route and scheduled transit services often result in low quality of travel experience and load factors in low density urban areas with weak and dispersed transport demand. In general, the only alternative is a massive use of private cars, with very low occupancy rates, causing road congestion and many other external costs, both at local and global levels.====This paper focuses on the potential of innovative technological mobility platforms able to provide transport services that might reduce transport intensity, by covering the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport.====In this context, Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services are well suited to be both shared and flexible, using fleets of vehicles scheduled “on demand” to pick up and drop off passengers in accordance with their needs (Ambrosino, Nelson, & Romanazzo, 2003).====Taking advantage of new ICT, they can dynamically match supply and demand and allow travellers to request rides in real-time from potential suppliers (e.g. ride sourcing services). They stand between unsustainable, flexible and individual transport services offered by private vehicles (e.g. cars) and sustainable, shared, but low-flexible traditional public transport services (metro, tram and bus), with different degrees of sustainability/shareability/flexibility according to the service (Fig. 1). In this respect, following the emerging concept of sharing economy, they can be shared among different passengers. Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can be regarded as a tool to shift away from a culture where consumers own assets (cars), toward the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) culture, where consumers “share access to assets” (Ambrosino, Nelson, Boero, & Pettinelli, 2016). DRST encompasses different types of services, from vehicle sharing (e.g. car sharing or peer to peer car sharing) to ride sharing. Ride sharing services can be performed by taxi sharing or carpooling, or they can have the connotation of “flexible” transit (e.g. microtransit or bus on demand). In particular, well-designed flexible transit services are able to find the right compromise between flexibility and fixed scheduling in order to have a reliable service (like traditional public transport), while flexible and adaptable, e.g. by changing (route) according to the demand.====The optimal design of a generic DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the community's point of view). The system stands between an expensive conventional exclusive-ride door-to-door service (like a conventional taxi), and a cheaper service where a dynamic sharing of trips makes users experiment longer travel distances and times, while the vehicles drop off and pick up other passengers (like a conventional bus). From the operator's point of view, it is important to select the optimal strategy to assign vehicles to passengers' requests, so to perform high load factor (to increase revenues) and low driven distance (to reduce operation costs), while minimizing the additional time and distances travellers have to experience (to assure the expected level of service). The problem could be approached by using operations research models, able to provide a real-time optimization to satisfy the dynamic demand. By the same token, but with a different approach, microsimulation models can be used to reproduce DRST services and predict the impacts of different strategies on the service efficiency. In particular, agent-based simulations are a suitable tool to understand the complexity of transport systems and the emergent phenomena deriving from the interaction between individual agents with different objectives and behaviours.====This paper contributes to the development DRST, in particular flexible transit services, by presenting an ==== agent-based model (ABM), implemented to test the impact of different operation strategies on service efficiency. The city of Ragusa (Italy) is chosen as case study, where an innovative DRST service has already been tested. The model is used as a realistic environment where to simulate different scenarios, with simple rules assigned to agents’ behaviour, in order to explore the transport demand and supply variables that make the service feasible and convenient. Starting from the microinteraction between demand and supply agents (i.e. passengers and vehicles), the macroscopic behaviour of the system is monitored, via appropriate indicators, and its performance evaluated to establish criteria for an optimal service design and operation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will present a literature review on shared transport services models; in Section 3, the methodology will be described, in particular the ABM with its main features (3.1); Section 4 will present the case study together with a description of scenario simulations (4.1) and results (4.2); Section 5 will resume the paper highlighting future research directions.",Multi-agent simulation for planning and designing new shared mobility services,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919300654,March 2019,2019,Research Article,346.0

By relying on the “dread hypothesis” and on the evidence of an increase in private transport subsequent attacks, we have estimated ","Current policy making in the transport sector aims to divert passengers traffic from roads to railways decrease external costs in terms of pollution, congestion, noise, accidents, to mention a few sources. Most of the actions and instruments adopted by local and national governments are in the forms of taxes, incentives and standards that assume that individuals behave rationally in the transport market. In this paper, we provide evidence that as individuals behaved irrationally after 2005 terrorist attacks in London, cities may experience peaks of pollution in the short run as people perceive public transit as riskier.====Terrorist attacks have often targeted public transit systems in recent years. A large literature has investigated the impact of attacks in terms of their death toll, disruption, and even general economic impact and policy making with the aim to reduce the burden of such events in terms of direct effects (Sandler & Enders, 2008).====From a policy perspective, comparatively less attention has been devoted to secondary effects, mainly driven by behavioral responses of users of public transit systems (Prager & von Winterfeldt, 2010). Gaigerenzer (2004; 2006) has found that after terrorist attacks in NYC on 9/11 an increase in car usage to avoid traveling by plane has resulted in a sizeable increase in the number of deaths by accident. The behavior leading to such choices was described in terms of the “dread hypothesis” consisting in three steps: a) avoidance of attacked transport means; b) substitution with modes that are less safe; c) increase in the number of fatalities.====Fasolo, Ni, and Phillips (2010) have estimated a contraction of subway passengers of about 12% until December 2005, following bombings in London on 7/7/2005. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the usage of bikes and motorbikes. Those two findings are hence consistent with points a) and b) of the “dread hypothesis”, although they could not find significant effects in terms of an increase in road accidents and fatalities.====Similar patterns of avoidance and substitution were also found in the case of 9/11 in New York (Beeler & Clemens, 2008; Blalock, Kadiyali, & Simon, 2005; Gigerenzer, 2004, 2006; Gordon, Kim, Moore, Park, & Richardson, 2007; Ito & Lee, 2005; Sivak & Flannagan, 2004), Israel (Becker & Rubinstein, 2004), Madrid (Lopez-Rousseau, 2004).====In this paper we propose an alternative formulation of the “dread hypothesis”, by starting from the final point of such hypothesis that implies an increase in external costs from transportation in the short run driven by a change in the perception of private benefits from mobility. In Fig. 1, a simple transport market is represented, with an initial equilibrium in E, given private marginal benefit and cost. In this situation, the amount of external cost is given by the dark shaded area. After an extreme shock, as in the case of a terrorist attack, the perception of safety and hence of marginal benefit from private transport may increase, shifting the demand schedule to the right. In such case, the new equilibrium is represented by point E’, with a subsequent increase in external cost. The light shaded area in the figure is the increase in externalities driven by the increase in the perceived marginal benefits from private transportation.====Fig. 2, Fig. 3 report the change in the composition of traffic in London. Data are available at different levels of frequency. In particular, Fig. 2 shows annual growth rates across several transport modes in London, such as bikes, motorbikes, cars and buses. Interestingly enough, 2005, the year of terrorist attacks, shows a decline in public transport and an increase in private transport in terms of bikes, but also polluting modes such as motorbikes and cars. Fig. 3 presents the percentage change in entries in the London tube between 2004 and 2005 during the same period. Also in this case, the drop in passengers is clear and relatively stable also two weeks after the attacks. However, differently from data in Fig. 2, in this case, we cannot exclude that those percentage changes were due to disruptions instead of dread behavior. However, taken together, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 seem to support the hypothesis that dread behavior took place in London after July 2005 bombings.====It should be noted that road accidents are a source of external costs from private transport, along with other times, among them, pollution. In this paper, we assume the results reported in Fasolo et al. (2010) of an increase in private transport in London after 2005 bombings and test whether such behavioral change has resulted also in an increase in pollution concentration. By using a quasi-experimental approach, we have identified a substantial increase in the concentration of PM10 and NO2 in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. Our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks and clearly indicate that this chance in the concentration was driven by an increase in road traffic.",Environmental consequences of dread behavior: A note on 2005 London bombings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885919300629,March 2019,2019,Research Article,347.0

Some important reasons hampering electric vehicle adoption are limited driving range (e.g. Lieven, Mühlmeier, Henkel, & Waller, 2011) and upfront purchasing cost (e.g. Carley, Krause, Lane, & Graham, 2013). Moreover, many people are not familiar with EVs, and also the fact that most car dealers exclusively sell conventional vehicles might contribute to EVs not to have broken through. Egbue and Long (2012) stated that there is a resistance among consumers against adopting new technologies that are far apart from the current norm, which might be another contributing factor.====On the Swedish island of Gotland, the project Elbilslandet (2014–2017) was launched to provide charging infrastructure to make the island “ready for the EV” and to stimulate more rental companies on the island to offer EVs for rent, besides the internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) that are generally offered. Over the course of the project, an increasing number of charging facilities have been installed throughout the island, providing a network of charging points. Nowadays, a few fast chargers (50 kW) and a relatively dense network of destination chargers (<23 kW) are available.====The aim of this case study is to explore the role of electric car rental during summer vacations as a potential contributor to consumer readiness to adopt electric vehicles for everyday use. For this study, constructs from the socio-psychological theories Transtheoretical Model of Change (Prochaska, 1991), as well as the Protection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1975), have been used. In the following section, more information about these theories is provided. Besides, the Diffusion of Innovations theory (Rogers, 2003) provided a general rationale for introducing EV rental in Gotland, as trialability of an innovation is considered to be a crucial factor. Both the perspective of the car rental company and the perspective of the end user have been taken into consideration.====The Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM; Prochaska, 1991) provides a conceptual framework for examining consumer readiness, by establishing a series of psychological stages before and after a behavioural change is implemented (stages-of-change). This allows progress towards change to be detected in survey studies, even for those who have not implemented the change of interest. By assessing consumer readiness for making a change, future demand can better be anticipated in light of a variety of explanatory factors.====The Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers, 1975) defines motivation for behavioural change to depend on Threat Appraisal (assessment of the threats related to the current behaviour) and Coping Appraisal (assessment of the possibility to cope with the new behaviour). The results of these appraisals influence the motivation to change behaviour according to the PMT.====The following research questions have been formulated:====The main aim of electric vehicle rental is its potential contribution to increased electric vehicle adoption. In this study, the process towards EV adoption among people that rented a car in Gotland is studied using the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Until now, this model has only been used in this context to describe the process towards electric vehicle adoption (Langbroek, Franklin, & Susilo, 2017) and the interplay between stage-of-change, socio-cognitive variables and monetary and non-monetary policy incentives (Langbroek, Franklin, & Susilo, 2016), in the absence of any intervention. EV rental can be considered as an intervention that might influence people's stage-of-change.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, a short overview of electric vehicle adoption research is given, followed by a description of the socio-psychological theories that have been used in this study.

Moreover, an ==== approach is used to determine important factors that affect hub location decisions. Our empirical results suggest that railway hub locations are unevenly distributed across regions in China. Most hubs are located around the capital city, Beijing, and there are no significant hubs in the southwest of China. Our results further show that the two important determinants of hub locations are railway infrastructure and population agglomeration. Policy implications are discussed in facilitating hub location decisions.","Both freight transport and interregional trade play an increasingly crucial role in regional and national economic development (Tsekeris, 2016). The interregional trade network is embedded in the interregional transport network, and therefore the planning of the transport network is important for regional development. A viably designed transport network will make interregional trade more efficient, and have an impact on national economic development (Farahani, Miandoabchi, Szeto, & Rashidi, 2013b).====Hubs serve as transhipment points and allow for the replacement of direct connections between nodes with fewer or indirect flows (Bryan & O'Kelly, 1999; O'Kelly, 1987). Hubs can help a logistic network run more efficiently, reducing the total cost, increasing the stability of the service and hedging against uncertainties in demand (Lium, 2009). Hubs have two main roles: the first is a switching, sorting or connecting (SSC) function, which directs or redirects the entire network with fewer links, and the other is a consolidation/breakbulk (CB) function, which aims to reduce costs over the whole network by achieving economies of scale (Campbell & O'Kelly, 2012). As transportation networks are mostly connected by public transport, this increases the importance of hubs as a mean to reduce the cost of operating the network (the roles of CB) (Campbell & O'Kelly, 2012).====Owing to its importance, hub selection is one of the most important issues when designing and planning a logistics network (Wang, Mo, & Wang, 2014). Hub selection is related to the allocation of the hubs and the arrangement of the authorities (non-hub points) around the hubs, which minimise the total costs of the logistics network or maximise its profits (An, Zhang, & Zeng, 2015). The current research on hub location issues concerns the models and algorithms that best determine the hubs in a given network including air (Bryan & O'Kelly, 1999), truck (Cunha & Silva, 2007) and water (Yang & Chen, 2016). Most of the solutions offered have demonstrated that the problem is difficult to solve. For example, in early hub research, single allocation hub models with a squared Euclidean distance were introduced in order to determine and design a single hub location in a network. Because the algorithm could only address a small number of hub locations in the problem, Campbell (1992) introduced a multiple allocation hub location model that increased the flexibility of the model and could determine more hub locations. This model increases usage at the expense of creating a computational burden, and requires a large number of variables (Campbell & O'Kelly, 2012). Nowadays, with the help of computer technology, researchers can design much more complex models to fit the needs of practical use. For example, Contreras, Díaz, and Fernández (2011b) introduced a branch-and-price algorithm that can handle up to 200 nodes, and later an improved Benders decomposition algorithm to handle up to 500 nodes (Contreras, Cordeau, & Laporte, 2011a).====Although there have been advances in solving hub location problems, in terms of air, water and truck, the research on freight railway is limited (some exceptions include Jeong, Lee, and Bookbinder (2007)), and there is even less research on interregional trade networks within a single country. These limitations mean that policymakers do not have enough information to railway hub locations; more importantly, knowledge on interregional hub locations may have important implications for large scale hub network design in countries with multiple regions, like China and the USA. In terms of models, the previous research has often used algorithms based on the calculation of transport costs and infrastructure services, but has not often captured, for example, cargo clustering, which emerges during interregional freight flow interactions (Farahani, Hekmatfar, Arabani, & Nikbakhsh, 2013a; Tsekeris, 2016). Thus, following the previous research on interregional trade networks, we adopt network analysis to model our interregional freight railway network.====In this paper, we use a three-step model to best identify the hub location, analyse the geographic distribution of network hubs and determine the factors that enable policymakers to determine the best hub locations in a network. We typically focus on Chinese interregional railway freight. First, we apply a number of centrality measurements in a network (i.e. betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, degree centrality, and hub metrics based on Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm). In this way, we can potentially identify a hub. The HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) measurement is introduced in this paper that enable us to better identify the nodes in a given network that function as the hub. This network-driven approach will also provide policymakers with a new perspective on the structure of a given logistics network that is different from the algorithm-driven hub-and-spoke approach (Cunha & Silva, 2007; Lin & Ban, 2013).====In the next step, we partition our analysis unit (China) into several trade market areas (TMAs) (Tsekeris, 2016). In this way, we can identify how many trade clusters are in a network, the distribution of hubs in each TMA, and how hubs and TMAs are geographically distributed in China. We first partition China into several TMAs (the optimal number of TMAs can be decided using the partition algorithm) using the modularity partition approach. Then we illustrate and analyse the TMA as part of the hub geography in China, which enables us to better understand how hubs function in each TMA (if there are enough hubs facilitating the trade of TMA). In using this approach, we identify not only the distribution of hubs across China, but also the hubs potentially needed in each TMA to enable trade efficiency and achieve economies of scale. Understanding the needs of hubs in each TMA, along with the determinants of hub locations (discussed in Section 4) will enable policymakers to make decisions about hub locations more easily.====Finally, we intend to identify the factors that can decide the location of a hub using an econometric approach. In this step, we forecast the factors that will result in hub location decisions. Using this approach, we can select the potential hubs in each TMA across China, using key geographic, economic and social variables. We take the spatial correlation consistent standard error (SCCSE) and panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) into consideration to increase the validity of our results. These two models have been used in interregional network analysis (Tsekeris, 2016). As the two approaches are non-parametric and parametric, respectively, the result is more robust. To further increase the validity of the result, we use PageRank as an alternative measurement of the hub (Brin & Page, 2012). The PageRank score was originally designed to measure the importance of internet links. It depicts how the node acts as the centre of the network in terms of attracting flows from other nodes (Tsekeris, 2016).====In summary, we take a three-step approach to visualise, describe, illustrate and determine the hub location problems in China. With the help of advanced social network analysis and econometrics approaches, our results will facilitate the decision-making processes of policymakers. The results have clear policy relevance and, unlike the complex models and algorithms that have addressed hub issues previously, policymakers will be able to determine the needs of hubs in each TMA and easily make decisions, based on our results.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We introduce our centrality metrics and describe the results in Section 2. In Section 3, we visualise and illustrate the hub location in each TMA in China. In Section 4, we use the panel regression method to determine the factors that affect decisions involving hub choice.

This study provides empirical evidence of significant interaction between the two modes. On November 24, 2015 the public transit rail system in Vancouver, Canada experienced a significant service disruption due to an unforeseen mechanical failure. This study exploits this event as a natural experiment and investigates to what extent the city's largest carsharing service was utilized as a substitute. Extensive carsharing vehicle location data are used to examine how the carsharing network responded to the transit service disruption. Empirical results show a dramatic increase in the use of carsharing vehicles during the transit outage, particularly in areas close to affected transit stations. Through ====, the quantity of vehicle trips accommodated by the carsharing system in response to the outage is estimated to be approximately 800. There is clear evidence of extemporaneous substitution between public transit and carsharing, suggesting the two modes act as parts of an integrated network.","The recent growth of carsharing has created an alternative mode of transportation for urban residents. How carsharing interacts with public transportation systems is an important concern for the future of public transportation, as well as the potential growth of carsharing. This paper uses data on carsharing vehicle locations, collected from Vancouver Canada's largest carsharing provider, car2go. By exploiting the impact of an unexpected outage in a public transportation service, this study provides novel estimates regarding the extemporaneous substitutability of carsharing for transit.====Prior work has argued that carsharing and public transit might operate as parts of an integrated network (Costain, Ardron, & Habib, 2012; Shaheen, Schwartz, & Wipyewski, 2004). The availability of carsharing allows those who have forgone private vehicle ownership to have an alternative mode available when public transit does not meet their needs. Empirical evidence on whether users substitute between public transit and carsharing is limited. The central contribution of the current paper is to demonstrate that commuters substitute carsharing trips for transit trips, when transit fails to meet their needs.====This study will be concerned with free-floating, one-way carsharing systems. Such systems allow users to begin and end trips anywhere within a geographic “home-zone,” delineated by the system operator. Trips may end at a different location than they began. This is in contrast to round-trip carsharing services which require trips to end where they began. The world's largest free-floating carsharing provider in terms of fleet size is car2go. car2go is a subsidiary of Daimler, and as of May 2018, operated in 23 cities across eight countries.====During the afternoon and evening of November 24, 2015 in Vancouver, a large portion of the public transportation system was shuttered due to an unexpected mechanical issue. This incident provides a natural experiment to estimate whether system users substitute between public transportation and carsharing. This paper will provide strong evidence that the use of the city's car2go system increased substantially during the transit outage.

Despite this general belief, little is known about the spatial distributional effects of land value uplift. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide new insights on how proximity to light rail transit stations may affect residential property values in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results provide information on spatial variations in the effects of a light rail transit system on residential property values. This study utilises GWR to account for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence. The results suggest that residential property values benefit from the provision of a light rail transit system but with considerable spatial variation over a geographical area. Evidently, proximity to the nearest light rail transit station gives positive premiums of up to 8% for a majority of properties located in lower-middle and upper-middle income neighbourhoods such as Wangsa Maju, Setapak, Keramat, Setiawangsa, Ampang and Sentul. In contrast, the impact of proximity to the nearest light rail transit station for properties located in high-income neighbourhoods such as Petaling Jaya was found to be non-significant. These findings can assist policy makers to better understand how properties around light rail transit stations accrue benefits. However, since the benefit of a light rail transit system on nearby properties varies over a geographical area (and where a positive premium can swing from positive to negative depending on the area), it may be difficult for policy makers to impose a single-value ==== if there is a land value capture policy to be considered for implementation.","Investment in a rail transit system such as heavy or light rail is often promoted as a mechanism to improve accessibility to key employment centres, educational institutions, and leisure amenities. In social terms, rail transit investments not only provide equal transit mobility for people, but more importantly, improved personal mobility for disadvantaged groups (Baum-Snow & Kahn, 2005; Pucher, 2004). Moreover, rail transit investments also bring a variety of benefits which address more modern concerns such as promoting physical activity (MacDonald, Stokes, Cohen, Kofner, & Ridgeway, 2010) congestion relief (Karpouzis, Rahman, Tandy, & Taylor, 2007), reduction in per capita road-traffic accidents (Lalive, Luechinger, & Schmutzler, 2013), reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Lalive et al., 2013; Chen & Whalley, 2012), and transit-oriented development (Peng, Li, & Choi, 2017). Alongside the benefits cited above, one of the most significant indirect benefits of a rail transit investment is the impact on ‘improved land’ value in the form of residential property values. Rail transit investment improves accessibility of the property to key activity centres and normally makes locations near transit stations more attractive. This should therefore capitalise and improve land values, in a process referred to as land value uplift.====Since rail transit systems have been proven to offer significant positive externalities, many cities in the world have begun to develop their own rail transit systems. However, developing and updating public transport infrastructure (such as rail transit systems), is one of the most expensive, complex and far-reaching investment decisions governments face (Mulley, 2014). In a developing country such as Malaysia, public transport infrastructure expenditures are financed primarily from borrowing and using funds from the federal government. These funds usually come from consolidated taxation revenue. Yet in many cases, there is a budgetary constraint on the government with respect to expenditures on public transport infrastructure. In addressing this constraint, one of the potential funding mechanisms that can be used is land value capture – a policy designed to capture land value increases that result from the provision of public transport infrastructure (Smith, Gihring, & Litman, 2009, 2006; Medda, 2012; van der Krabben & Needham, 2008). In an age of widespread fiscal restraint, land value capture and other alternative sources of capital have become increasingly attractive options for financing public transport that involve contributions from a range of public and private stakeholders (Zhao & Levinson, 2012). To assess whether a land value capture policy is feasible, information about land value uplift following a public transport infrastructure investment is required. This is due to the fact that property values should reflect, at any point in space, the combined influence of positive and negative externalities linked to the proximity of a nearby rail transit station.====The purpose of this paper is therefore to capture land value uplift for residential properties around light rail transit stations in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The null hypothesis is that proximity to the nearest light rail transit station has no positive effect on residential property values. Knowledge about land value uplift around rail transit stations in the Greater Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area (with its increasing and sprawling population) is important, as it helps to shed light on the promise of public transport networks for supporting the sustainability of the city's future development and the potential for planning future rail transit investments. The findings from this paper are useful to urban planners and policy makers, both in Greater Kuala Lumpur and around the world, who are increasingly looking to apply land value capture policy as a potential funding mechanism for the operation and construction of rail transit projects. In particular, they are useful for the estimation of value increments caused by rail transit systems. They are also useful in ensuring land value capture policy captures the actual changes in land values caused by a given project. Land value uplift is also an important category of information for potential developers and home buyers, who might target land and property around light rail transit stations. They might consider such properties as representing a good return on investment. This paper therefore contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence about land value uplift around light rail transit stations in the context of a developing country and by considering the spatial distributional effects of land value uplift.====The paper begins by reviewing the relevant literature with respect to the development of an understanding of the relationship between proximity to rail transit systems and residential property values.

This study examines the role of transport infrastructure in explaining the ==== process at the ","By 2015, four billion people were living in cities, accounting for 54% of the total world population; a growth of 73% from the 1990 urban population statistic (UN-Habitat, 2016). Rapid population growth and economic activity leads the expansion of cities and creates vast conurbation areas, comprising urban centres and suburbs. Internally, economic activities in cities expand beyond their administrative borders. More urban development is found in suburbs than in city areas, a phenomenon which is observed not only in cities in developed countries, such as Tokyo (Cybriwsky, 1993), but also in developing countries (Morichi & Acharya, 2013; Hassan, 2017).====Rapid suburb development is also evident in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA), the most populous and urbanized region in Indonesia. Consisting of 13 municipal areas,==== JMA is home to 11% of Indonesia's population and contributes about 22% of the national gross domestic product (Indonesian Bureau of Statistics, 2010). Despite 14.5% increase in population, the proportion of people living in Jakarta decreased from 39.4% to 34.0% out of the total JMA population between 2000 and 2010, indicating that more people were living in the suburbs. In addition, the urban population rose by 90% between 1990 and 2010 (Jones et al., 2016), transforming some outer areas of the JMA into new sub-centres. A similar trend was also seen with regard to economic activity, as industrial activity moved from the core of Jakarta to the suburbs (Henderson & Kuncoro, 1996).====The changes in the JMA population distribution are partly attributed to infrastructure expansion (such as the building of highways and railways). The development of highways and railway lines leads to suburb-urban commuting becoming more accessible. Recent transport infrastructure development also has the potential to promote the relocation of production activities to the fringes of Jakarta. A study by Henderson and Kuncoro (1996) suggests that there was some degree of suburbanization in the manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2000 in response to the development of a toll road running from Jakarta. Identifying the causal relationship between transport infrastructure and changes in the urban spatial structure of the Jakarta Metropolitan Area is crucial in examining the extent to which the urban structure-transportation network nexus is prevalent in the context of megacities in developing countries.====Our paper estimates the relationship between improvement in transportation access and changes in the urban structure of the JMA for a sample of 1483 communities (====) in years 2000 and 2010; these urban structure changes are reflected by changes in population density and economic activity. As current economic indicators are unable to measure economic activities at the community level, we use light intensity data as a proxy for economic activity. To address the potential simultaneity bias in the regression model, we used specifications that measured the improvement in transportation access using old transport infrastructure access i.e., access to the old railway network, old primary roads, and Anyer-Panarukan Road). Our results suggest that improvement in access to highways and access to railways station has promoted the suburbanization process in the JMA, although the roles differ.====Our study contributes to the body of literature relating to transportation network and urban structure, and the suburbanization process in particular, in two ways. A novel is that we propose night light as a proxy for the extent of the transport network in explaining the dynamics of economic activity. This expands our understanding of the fact that the suburbanization process is not only captured by faster population growth (Baum-Snow, 2007; Garcia-Lopez and Angel., 2012; Garcia-Lopez, Angel, Adelheid Holl, & Viladecans-Marsal, 2015), but is also explained by faster light night intensity growth in suburbs than in urban ones. Our study is also of international interest, as like other metropolitan areas in developing countries, JMA is experiencing a fast-changing spatial structure. The study is of further potential use in understanding the suburbanization process in Asian primate cities such as Jakarta. The results confirm that transportation-led suburbanization is a common phenomenon, not only in cities in developed countries, but also in developing countries.====The paper proceeds as follows.

In general, we find that both airfare and air travel demand decreased significantly after the entry of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR. In particular, economy-class airfares dropped more than business-class fares did, while the decline in the demand for business-class travel was larger than it was for economy-class travel. The frequency of and the number of seats on the HSR line were significantly and negatively associated with air travel demand, especially with demand for business-class travel. Our results show that the entry of the HSR line led to airfare convergence on the Beijing-Shanghai airline route, which might indicate the existence of tacit collusion among the operating carriers. Governments, airlines and airport authorities need to work together to improve the on-time performance of this profitable route which is currently plagued with frequent flight delays.","Connecting China's two largest cities, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail (HSR) line is China's busiest HSR route with a ridership of more than 160 million in 2016 (HTL, 2017). It started operation on June 30, 2011 and remains China's most profitable HSR line, reporting a 6.6 billion RMB net operational profit in 2015 (Li, 2016). Before September 2017, HSR trains travelled at a speed of 300 km/h. Since then the speed has been raised to 350 km/h for some of the trains on the route. At this speed, the fastest HSR trains, which make only one intermediate stop, take 4 h and 24 min to travel from Beijing to Shanghai, compared to 11 h and 50 min on the fastest trains running on parallel conventional railway. The Beijing-Shanghai HSR line links China's two important economic zones, the Jing-Jin-Ji (i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) Metropolitan area and the Yangtze River Delta (around Shanghai), covering 26.7% of the total population of Mainland China and connecting 11 cities each with populations of over 1 million (NetEase, 2016). In 2018, the China Railway Corporation (CRC) announced that it had started the process for an initial public offering (IPO) to publicly list the Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway Co. Ltd, the unit that is responsible for the Beijing-Shanghai HSR line, which is unprecedented in China. This paper explores the impact of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR line on airfares and air traffic along this HSR route, considering both economy-class and business-class passengers. To the best of our knowledge, no study looks at the impact of HSR on both economy-class and business-class airline passengers in the Chinese domestic market. An investigation of the impact on air transport of the most heavily travelled HSR route in China, and probably the busiest rail line in the world, adds value to the HSR-air literature and sheds light on the HSR-air competition in other markets.====The main findings are summarized as follows. First, the entry of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR has put pressure on both airfare and air travel demand along the HSR line. However, the markets served by the Air China Group and the China Eastern Group experienced less impact on their airfares and traffic. Second, fares for economy-class tickets decreased more than they did for business-class tickets, while the demand for business-class air travel declined more dramatically than it did for economy-class air travel. Third, the frequency of and the number of seats on HSR trains affected the demand for business-class air travel more than they did for economy-class air travel. Airfares were largely unaffected regardless of the cabin class. Fourth, the entry of the HSR line has led to more stable airfares on the Beijing-Shanghai route with smaller absolute price differences between airlines on this route.====Compared with previous studies, this paper has three main contributions. First, we focus exclusively on the impact of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR line on airfare and air travel demand, which allows for an in-depth analysis of this route and the two competing travel modes. The Beijing-Shanghai market is important because it is the busiest and the most profitable market for both HSR and airlines in China (Sun, Zhang, & Wandelt, 2017). According to Wang, Jiao, Du, and Hu (2015), large cities with a population of more than three million are the major competition market for HSR and air transport in China. Therefore, the Beijing-Shanghai market, which contains China's two megacities, is a suitable market for examining the competitive behavior between airlines and HSR. Second, we consider the effect of HSR on both economy- and business-class air passengers, providing rationale on how competition from the HSR affects these market segments differently. This is the first paper investigating the impact of HSR on airline business-class passengers in the Chinese market. Chen (2017) studies competition between HSR and airlines in the Beijing-Shanghai market but does not distinguish between airline passenger types. The third contribution is the uniqueness of our dataset. We construct a unique panel dataset with observations including four years before and six years after the launching of the HSR line. This reveals the impact of HSR from a long term perspective with a high degree of accuracy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature to develop the hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data and basic model. Section 4 presents the results and analysis.

For a deep understanding of these effects, we analysed EV, by dividing them into individual Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), which are 100% electric, and Plug-in ==== (PHEV). The factors examined include: policy, social, economic, environmental, and technical. This paper uses data from 2010 to 2016 for a panel of the 24 EU countries. A Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) estimator is used. When comparing the results of analysing BEV and PHEV individually, and all EV together, they prove to be quite different. This finding indicates that policies should be tailored to each individual technology, rather than a single one for all EV. The proxy used for technological progress is the increased use of both BEV and PHEV. The evidence is also provided that charging stations are drivers of electric mobility.","The penetration of renewable sources within the electricity mix, is one of the measures intended to support the transition to low-carbon economies. However, sectors intensive in fossil fuels, such as the Transport Sector (TS) continue to hamper this transition. The IEA (2016) indicates that this sector is accountable for 23% of global CO2 emissions, with road transport being responsible for around 17%. Therefore, to decarbonise economies, there has to be a change in the TS energy paradigm.====The penetration of Electric Vehicles (EV) within the automotive market has been pursued with this objective in mind. Electric Vehicles (EV) can be categorized into: Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV). Technically, HEV is characterized as having both an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), powered by gasoline, diesel, methane or liquid gas, and an alternative electric motor, which is powered by electricity stored in a battery. The batteries of these cars are charged by regenerative braking systems and by their ICE. In the same way, PHEV use both an electric motor powered by batteries and an ICE powered by fossil sources. In general, PHEV have larger batteries than HEV and can also be charged directly from the electricity grid. These vehicles can be powered solely by electricity or by a specific fossil fuel. BEV (also known as 100% EV) only use batteries, charged from the electricity grid, to power an electric motor. Although BEV still hold a lower share of the automotive market, the number of these vehicles is increasing significantly (Brenna, Foiadelli, Roscia, Zaninelli, & Member, 2012).====Although the market share of EV is expected to be much more significant within a few decades, currently it remains small. This expected increase remains heavily dependent on technological improvements in batteries (Hannan, Lipu, Hussain, & Mohamed, 2017). Furthermore, there are other factors that may encourage or inhibit decisions to acquire EV (Adnan, Nordin, & Rahman, 2017; Coffman, Bernstein, & Wee, 2017a). However, empirical analyses based on historical data, of the role played by these factors remain scarce. Some exceptions include Li, Chen and Wang, (2017) and Li, Long, Chen and Geng, (2017), who analysed the role of socioeconomic factors and renewables on EV adoption in 14 countries from 2010 to 2015.====The contribution made by this paper to the literature is twofold. Firstly, it empirically analyses the role of several factors, namely policy, social, economic, environmental, and technical on EV adoption of both BEV and PHEV. In fact, this paper represents a considerable improvement on the scant literature that has analysed the factors supporting EV adoption. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, the literature has not yet focused on the role played in the diffusion of EV by progress in battery technology, via an empirical approach using historical data. In summary, this paper aims to answer the following central questions: (i) what are the factors that promote the penetration of EV?; (ii) are these factors identical for BEV and PHEV?; and (iii) is technological progress the main driver for EV deployment?====The analysis of these effects was performed using annual data from 2010 to 2016 for a panel of 24 EU countries. Accordingly, three models were estimated (BEV, PHEV, and EV) by using the Panel Corrected Standard Error (PCSE) estimator, because it is appropriate for dealing with the features of the data. The robustness of the results was performed by employing a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR). The results suggest that each EV vehicle type must be analysed individually rather than jointly as a whole. Policy factors have been effective in increasing the market share of BEV, but not of PHEV. Regarding social factors, both education level and employment rate increase the BEV market share. Only the number of charging stations and the proxy for technological development have a similar effect on both BEV and PHEV, and jointly analysis of the EV. In fact, both of them increase the likelihood of deciding to acquire a BEV or PHEV. Renewable electricity generation proves to be appropriate for increasing the number of BEV and PHEV.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 revises the literature focused on EV adoption; section 3 describes the data used and the methodology applied. The results are presented in section 4 and their robustness is checked in the subsection 4.1. In section 5, the results are discussed, and some policy guidelines are provided.
