Our main contribution is to detail how optimal subsidies on clean technologies should incorporate life cycle emissions when carbon pricing is limited. The optimal downstream subsidy should be corrected for all external costs generated in the upstream sector, not only unpriced pollution but also the fiscal externality due to the subsidy to the clean upstream technology. We also analyze the ==== optimization of upstream and downstream policies.

We evaluate five public policy interventions: a biomass co-firing subsidy, two carbon emissions fees, and two clean energy standards. Treating woody biomass as a carbon neutral feedstock, we find co-firing weakly supports decarbonization. However, policies subsidizing co-firing can delay retirement of coal facilities and reduce generation from nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar. Consequently, corresponding sector-wide emissions of CO==== and SO==== may increase (slightly) due to greater utilization of coal plants including relatively inefficient facilities. We assume NO==== emissions increase due to generation efficiency losses, but this remains uncertain. Due to higher emissions, a biomass subsidy for co-firing yields small (near zero) economic welfare losses, while in contrast other policies advance decarbonization and yield significant welfare gains.

In response to RE promotion, wholesale electricity prices and carbon emissions are therefore expected to decrease. In interconnected electricity systems, this so-called merit-order effect stimulates a change in electricity trade flows. Therefore, conventional generation and prices in neighboring countries are also likely to decrease. The impact of these trade reactions on carbon offsets is ambiguous and depends on installed generation and interconnector capacities. Moreover, the cross-border merit-order effect causes opposing effects on consumers and producers: generators’ profits decline, while consumers benefit from lower electricity costs and an increase in the consumer surplus. Using a rich data set of hourly technology-specific generation and wholesale market price data for ten central European countries, we estimate the domestic and cross-border impacts of German RE for the years 2015–2020.

We identify the optimal trajectories of resources use, mainly depending on the relative scarcity of the resources and on their emissions. Although recycling is usually, and correctly, noted as an opportunity to reduce the impact of consumption on primary resources and waste, we also consider the possible negative environmental consequences of recycling and we discuss the resulting arbitrations. We characterize the optimal recycling strategy and we show that, in some cases, the recycling rate through time is an inverted U-shape, and there can be a catch-up phase of consumption at the end of the social planner program. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our model by identifying and analyzing the set of optimal tax-subsidy schemes, and we highlight the existence of standard environmental externalities as well as a positive externality linked to the absence of a market for waste.",None,"Recycling under environmental, climate and resource constraints",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765521000634,25 November 2021,2021,Research Article,45.0

Our paper fills this critical gap in the literature, applying a difference-in-differences approach to high frequency smart meter data of about 1600 EV homes from 2014 to 2019 in Arizona, United States. First, we find that the electricity demand during the system peak hours from 6 to 8 pm in summer can increase by 7–14 % at an average household with in-home EV charging. Second, EV households respond to electricity pricing signals by increasing their charging in lower-priced off-peak hours within the EV-specific time-of-use (TOU) pricing. Third, we find evidence of rebound effects in driving that lead to a reduction in home-electricity consumption in certain hours of the day. Lastly, we show that our empirical estimation of the grid impact due to in-home EV charging is different from that predicted by existing simulation models due to factors such as consumer behaviors.

We categorize the waste disposal fee policies into two: advance disposal fee (ADF) policy and disposal fee (DF) policy. We show that a DF policy has two opposing effects on durability. Firstly, a DF policy gives the producer an incentive to increase durability in order to delay the households’ waste disposal and to discount future payments of the disposal fee (the payment-discounting effect). Secondly, a DF policy creates an incentive for consumers to dump waste illegally in order to mitigate the payment of the disposal fee, and gives the producer an incentive to reduce durability in order to avoid market saturation and the associated future price cuts (the illegal-dumping effect). When the disposal fee is low, the payment-discounting effect dominates the illegal-dumping effect under a DF policy, leading to the enhancement of durability. In this case, from a social welfare viewpoint, a DF policy may be more desirable than an ADF policy if the environmental damage associated with illegal dumping is not serious. However, when the disposal fee is high, a DF policy induces more illegal dumping, reduces durability, and inflicts more environmental damage. Therefore, an ADF policy is more socially desirable than a DF policy when the disposal fee is high.

Car owners are influenced by price incentives as well as by external effects from traffic (such as congestion) both in regular lanes and in bus lanes.

Second, farmers’ irrigation decisions are non-monotonic with respect to well capacity and climate conditions. Under a drier climate, producers with greater well capacities increase their groundwater use, and producers with lower well capacities reduce their water use.

Using a unique dataset of 2164 industrial-waste landfill sites from 1992 to 2012, we find robust evidence of a persistent spatial concentration of sites managed by private companies. The empirical results show that economic factors and the existence of other waste-related facilities have a positive effect on the private landfill site location. Interestingly, this relationship has been fairly stable for twenty years despite a significant decline in the number of sites in operation. In addition, we find that prefectural-level policies tend to decrease the opening of new landfill sites in the area. These results highlight the role of public intervention in mitigating a concentration of facilities that might be undesirable to neighbors.",None,The spatial concentration of waste landfill sites in Japan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765518304214,20 September 2019,2019,Research Article,137.0

However, the bulk of VSL research has focussed on estimating average values rather than taking account of the potential variation in VSL across groups. Policymakers are particularly concerned that using estimates based on data concerning adults might provide poor proxies of the values associated with preventing child fatalities. We investigate this empirical problem while also addressing methodological critiques of standard ==== (CV) approaches to VSL estimation which ask survey respondents to value an outcome described in terms of both the probability of occurrence and the health impact of an event. A prior lab experiment confirms fundamental problems in subjects’ abilities to provide internally consistent valuations of such compound goods. Given this we compare CV approaches with the ‘chaining method’ of Carthy et al. (1999) which splits the valuation task in two, assessing the probability of an event and the disutility of that event separately and then ‘chaining’ responses together to obtain a VSL estimate. We provide a first application of this method to the estimation of the VSL for children and contrast this with values for adults. Results confirm prior expectations that VSL values for preventing child fatalities significantly exceed those for adults. Finally, we carry out the first replication of the chaining approach in a large and nationally representative sample of parents. We identify many advantages of chaining over CV approaches, however, through a novel variant of a validation test suggested by Carthy et al., we reveal anomalies in the estimates produced by the chaining method suggesting that a robust method for VSL calculation is yet to be refined.",None,The value of statistical life for adults and children: Comparisons of the contingent valuation and chained approaches,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765518303014,10 May 2019,2019,Research Article,151.0
