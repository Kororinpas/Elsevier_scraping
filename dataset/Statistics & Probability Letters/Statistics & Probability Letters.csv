We derive three uniform convergence results: the uniform bias expansion, the uniform convergence rate, and the uniform asymptotic linear representation. The uniformity in the above results is with respect to both ==== and ==== and therefore has not previously been addressed in the literature on local polynomial regression. Such uniform convergence results are especially useful when the conditional distribution estimator is the first stage of a semiparametric estimator. We demonstrate the usefulness of these uniform results with two examples: the stochastic equicontinuity condition in ====, and the estimation of the integrated conditional distribution function.",None,Uniform convergence results for the local linear regression estimation of the conditional distribution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167715223001104,Available online 10 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

It turns out that we need to discuss the covariance of two functions with respect to multivariate Gaussian distributions. Gaussian correlation inequalities hold for many symmetric (with respect to the origin) cases. However, in our case, the max function and its derivatives are not symmetric about the origin. We have two main results in this paper. First, we prove a specific case for a convex/log-concave correlation inequality for the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution. The other result is that the variance of maxima of standard Gaussians with ====, while ====, for other ====, is larger than the variance of maxima of independent standard Gaussians.
